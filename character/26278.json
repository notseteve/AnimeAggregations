  "description" : "Cassie Lockhart is a third-year student at East Genetics known as Godspeed for her Quadruple Accel technique who is considered to be the most powerful Pandora at her academy. Although she has the highest synchronization rate with Kazuha`s Stigmata and received them, Cassie does not feel she is the most powerful Pandora and believes herself to be undeserving of the title. Her father forced her to attend East Genetics to become a Pandora. She has feelings for her Limiter Kyouichi. During a battle with a Type-R Nova, her body was absorbed into it, causing her and several of her comrades, including Milena, to assume Nova Form. She, along with other East Genetics students, launched an attack on West Genetics per the Nova`s will, and fought Satellizer, nearly killing her until she was beaten and restored to her former self.\nSource: Wikipedia",
