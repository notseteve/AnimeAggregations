  "description" : "Granbull is a large, purple, bipedal bulldog with a pair of imposing, heavy fangs protruding from its lower jaw. The lower jaw is quite developed and, taken together with the fangs, heavy enough that Granbull must constantly decide between tipping its head back for balance and tilting its head down for decreased energy exertion. As its large mouth and fangs are built specifically for offense, Granbull can bite with a crushing amount of power. Granbull`s vicious appearance is a natural intimidation tactic meant to discourage any other Pokémon from assaulting it. In spite of its appearance, however, it is rather timid and easily spooked, and it only defends itself in retaliation to an assault upon it. When it is attacked by another Pokémon in the wild, Granbull flails about with its limbs to ward off its attacker.",
