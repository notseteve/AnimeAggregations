  "description" : "Homulilly is the witch form of Akemi Homura. She is the Nutcracker Witch. Its nature is self-sufficiency. Its gallant form, which once split many nuts, is now useless. Without any other purpose, this witch`s last wish is her own execution. However, a mere decapitation will not clear away the witch`s sins. This foolish witch will forever remain in this realm, repeating the procession to her execution.\nSecond Form (on the right)\nHer teeth are exposed, her skull has melted, and her eyeballs have fallen out. A promise is the only thing that pitifully planted in that head which can no longer crack any nuts, but within the husk of the awakened witch is the distinct form of a magical girl. Her servants shamefully refer to that thing as a good-for-nothing.\nSource: Puella Magi Wiki",
