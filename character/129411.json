  "description" : "Drasna`s Altaria was first seen on television during an interview with Drasna when it was announced that she would face off against Ash Ketchum in a Pokémon World Championships Hyper Class battle. It was later revealed that it had a training battle with Wikstrom`s Escavalier. It is capable of Mega Evolving.\n-- Pokémon World Championships Hyper Class Battle VS Ash --\nAltaria was the second Pokémon that Drasna battled with and it mainly faced off against Ash`s Dracovish. Half way through the battle, it mega evolved and as a result it`s type changed from Dragon/Flying to Dragon/Fairy but Ash Ketchum didn`t realize this and it told Dracovish to use Dragon Rush but it wasn`t very effective. Nearing defeat, Dracovish was recalled and Ash`s Sirfetch`d used Meteor Assault to knocked out Drasna`s Mega Altaria but it also was knocked out in the process.",
