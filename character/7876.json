  "description" : "Ashton is a swordsman possessed by a two-headed dragon. Ashton himself is noisy and can be clumsy, but he is a capable fighter and can act courageously when the need arises. Regularly plagued with bad luck, people avoided him and he lived a lonely existence. After meeting Claude, Rena, and Celine, who offered him genuine friendship, he claims that they are the reason the dragons are infused with his body as an excuse to travel with them. Though Ashton is angry when he learns Gyoro and Ururun have been taking over his body, when he receives the King`s Teardrop that would remove them he can`t go through with it because it would cause them die and he is too fond of them. When he meets Precis, he falls in love with her but she only has eyes for Claude.",
