  "description" : "Razor is one of the Gamemasters and a creator of Greed Island. Razor was entrusted by Gon`s father that he was not to hold back against his son should he ever comes to Greed Island. Razor is a key person in getting one of the hardest designated card of the game. To get the card, the challengers must confront Razor and his 14 devils in a group of 15 people, and defeat them in different sporting events. It is learned that the 14 devils were not his allies, but Razor`s own ability to emit 14 Nen creatures at will. He is defeated in a dodgeball game by Gon`s allied party (consisting of Gon, Killua, Biscuit, Hisoka, and several other hunter/players hired by Battera). Razor later reveals to Gon that he was formerly a convict captured by Ging and brought to the island as a prisoner. Inspired by Ging`s spirit, Razor helped him create Greed Island and became the warden for the convicts. He also became one of Ging`s friends and was entrusted to look after the island as one of its Gamemasters.\nSource: Wiki",
