  "description" : "Reg is an amnesic robot or cyborg in the shape of a human boy. Initially having no memory of an own name, he was named Reg after a dog http://anidb.net/ch88493 [Riko] used to own. Surprisingly, he could consume organic food despite being classified as a machine. His mechanic arms can shoot and extend to grab hard to reach objects as well as shooting out a deadly straight heat beam that can melt objects at a distance which Riko names \"Incinerator\".\nSource: Wikipedia",
