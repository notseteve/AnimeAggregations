Mana works as a waitress at the Azur Restaurant and often comes over to Yorito`s house to cook for him. She looks after her younger sister Koyori. She also knows about Matsuri`s secret.\nShe eventually takes up Yorito`s hobby of taking pictures of clouds in the early morning, although she has no more memories of him.",
