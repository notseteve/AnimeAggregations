He plays a significant role in seducing the young Alone into becoming Hades`s corporal vessel. He first appears as a priest from the cathedral located deep in the forest to persuade Alone, who at the time had trouble finding fitting colors for his painting, to look for a fruit that yields the True Red, the color that surpasses all colors.",
