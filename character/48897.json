  "description" : "This small utility spacecraft was seen only briefly during Space War I when it participated in a salvage operation to recover a damaged U.N. Spacy reconnaissance craft. Equipped with two large and two small manipulator arms, the Salvage Ship is able to grasp any type of object and hold it firmly in place. One large main booster mounted aft and two separate thrusters on the lower aft section provide the Salvage Ship with plenty of thrust and allow the craft to move swiftly even carrying sizable loads.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/salvageship.htm",
