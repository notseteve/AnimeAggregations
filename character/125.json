  "description" : "Hiroko is Ippo`s widowed mother. She is a very kind and strong willed woman who cares for her son a great deal. She started running the fishing business after her husband, Kazuo, died after saving his friend Sakuma. Though she refuses to attend any of Ippo`s matches because she doesn`t want to watch him get hurt, she supports his boxing wholeheartedly because she knows how much joy it has brought to his life and how it has helped him with his self-esteem. Since Kazuo`s death, Ippo and Hiroko have been more or less alone in the world; so the strength of their family bond is no surprise.",
