  "description" : "Mushin Oneiros is the leader of the gods of Dreams. He is absent in Greek mythology, for his very name in the myth is spelled as Oneiroi, the colloquial term that referred Morpheus, Icelos and Phantasos. This hints his true power, as Oneiros is the only son of Hypnos without a power of his own.",
