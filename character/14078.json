She is an intelligence agent and an expert martial artist noted for sending three colleagues into hospital during training.\nYouko arrives on a train somewhere corresponding to contemporary Russian Siberia, cross-dressing as a male diplomat and attempting to link up with fellow agent Nanbu Koutaro, codenamed \"Adam\", for a film containing radio codes.\nDue to her inexperience, however, she quickly becomes the subject of suspicion and is only rescued by Saiga Kazuo, another fellow agent known as \"Tiger of Siberia\". Although Kazuo turns out to be a double-agent whose henchmen end up killing Kohtaro, Youko is able to defeat him and complete her mission with Hazuki`s help.",
