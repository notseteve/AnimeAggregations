  "description" : "While traveling through Viridian Forest, Ash was approached by Samurai, who was looking for the next trainer from Pallet Town. Samurai challenged Ash to a Pokémon battle, causing Ash to forget about the wild Weedle he was trying to capture, which then escaped. The battle started off with Samurai`s Pinsir going up against Ash`s Pidgeotto, who was already tired from the battle it just had with the wild Weedle. Samurai`s Pinsir quickly defeated Ash`s Pidgeotto, forcing Ash to call on Ash`s Metapod. Ash`s Metapod`s Harden raised its defense enough so that Samurai`s Pinsir`s horns had no effect on it. Samurai then recalled Samurai`s Pinsir and sent out Samurai`s Metapod. The two Pokémon were locked in a stalemate using the same Harden attack over and over again. However, the battle was forced into a draw when a swarm of wild Beedrill approached and flew off with Ash`s Metapod.\nIn hot pursuit by the Beedrill, the group ran off and headed for Samurai`s cabin. Once there, Samurai revealed that he had previously battled and lost to Gary Oak and the other two trainers from Pallet Town. Samurai told Ash that he was a joke of a trainer compared to the previous trainers that had come from Pallet. He then called Ash a bad trainer for leaving Ash`s Metapod outside with the Beedrill. The next day, Ash was able to retrieve Ash`s Metapod, which evolved into Ash`s Butterfree. Ash was then able to earn the respect of Samurai after he defeated the swarm of Beedrill with his new Pokémon.",
