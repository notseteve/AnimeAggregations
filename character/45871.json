  "description" : "Brycen`s Vanillish was the first Pok√©mon Brycen sent out and Ash countered with his Krokorok. Astonish was an effective way to make Ash`s Krokorok flinch, preventing it from attacking. When Ash`s Krokorok broke free, it tried to dig into the ice but halfway down Brycen`s Vanillish Blizzard froze the bottom part of Ash`s Krokorok. Ash knew he couldn`t continue on like this and he recalled Krokorok.\nAsh`s Scraggy was then sent out for its first gym battle. It started off by hurting its knee when it missed with its Hi Jump Kick but it was able to surprise Brycen by defending itself against attacks by pulling up its skin to protect itself. From that point on Ash`s Scraggy dominated the battle and was able to finish off Brycen`s Vanillish with an effective Headbutt.",
