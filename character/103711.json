One night during the war, Ise and his family were hiding in their battle-damaged house when Konoha ninja broke in looking for food. Ise and his family tried to sneak away but when they were detected. Ise fought the ninja to give Nagato a chance to escape, but the Konoha ninja, assuming the couple were enemy ninja, attacked and quickly killed first Fusō and then the devastated Ise.\nWitnessing this, Nagato unknowingly awakened his Rinnegan, and he subsequently killed the two Konoha-nin. Nagato buried his parents before leaving to search for food. The death of his parents is the first great tragedy of his life, and in his eyes evidence that the peace Konoha preaches comes at the cost of others` lives.",
