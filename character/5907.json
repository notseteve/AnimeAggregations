She is always talking about Kyouta and seems to be one of his greatest fans. She is too scared to talk to him herself but is constantly attending the shows of http://anidb.net/ch40597 [his band].\nAsumi and Kiriko hang out often though they are opposites. Kiriko`s personality is often hyper and sometimes childlike but innocent and sweet. She is devastated to find out that Kyouta has a love interest.",
