  "description" : "Anna is the third girl hired by Yoshitaka. Initially she is charmed by Yoshitaka`s behaviour, but is relentlessly convinced by Izumi to stay away from him. Anna mistakes Izumi`s efforts for signs of interest and falls in love with her, hence signing a contract with Yoshitaka to get closer to Izumi. As most characters in the show, she oftenly harasses Izumi (taking her first kiss, for example). Also, Anna studies Dutch so that she may someday travel to Netherlands to get married with Izumi. Her other treats include awful cooking skills and the ability to kick Pochi`s ass in most dire situations.",
