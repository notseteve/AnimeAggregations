He wanted to become a professional player and his friends thought he had the talent for it. However, he found out that his salary-man father was a football player just like him in his youth and even played at the national level. The fact that someone just like him didn`t make it shook Waku`s resolve and he stopped playing football. If he had not quit the team he wouldn`t have been at the summer class and become a pilot. He was chosen to become the first pilot of the children.",
