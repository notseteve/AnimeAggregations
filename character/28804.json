  "description" : "Oki Kazutoshi is Nishiura`s reserve pitcher and first baseman. He is a very shy and nervous character who rarely speaks his mind because he is afraid that he might be scolded by the others. He has more pitching experience than Hanai, but was reluctant to admit it as he didn`t want to pitch in official games. However, he is inspired by Mihashi`s dedication and decides to try his best for the team. He is the team`s only left-handed player.",
