  "description" : "Edgar is a flirtatious man in his early twenties with very distinctive ash mauve eyes. When he was young his parents were both murdered. As a result, he was thrown onto the streets and branded as a white slave. He was subsequently framed as a mass murderer and forced to flee from America for his alleged crimes. Stripped of his honourable name, Edgar embarks on a journey to find the famed Sword of Merrow. By obtaining the sword, Edgar hopes to assert himself as the \"Earl of the Blue Knights\" thus acquiring a respectable title and gaining a fabricated sense of honour.",
