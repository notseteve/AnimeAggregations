  "description" : "The Secretary of the Student Council, nicknamed \"Daisy-chan.\" She is a Second-year student, who will do whatever Soujirou tells her to do, from participating in the Gachinko Vivage Battle Tournament to going undercover on a Student Council Operation to catch a ring of blackmailers. She speaks harshly, and insults people on purpose, often saying things like \"Drown in a gutter and die\", or \"Drown, die, revive, and die again.\" She has good aim, and relentlessly attacks without hesitation. While she seems calm and composed on the outside, she is quick to judge others, and thus, underestimate them. She doesn`t handle failure very well, and will console herself by cuddling stuffed animals. She especially dislikes bothering other people, so she rarely asks for help.",
