  "description" : "Bounsweet is a Grass-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Steenee starting at level 18, which evolves into Tsareena when leveled up while knowing Stomp.\nBounsweet is a small Pokémon resembling a mangosteen. Most of its body is pinkish-purple with a short, white skirt around its waist. It has beady yellow eyes and two tiny legs. On top of its head is a green calyx. This structure consists of four leafy green formations and a short stem.\nThis Pokémon exudes a delicious smell from its entire body, which has made it popular with people of the Alola region. This scent has a calming effect on people, so they are often used as living air fresheners. However, its sweet scent has also caused it to be swallowed whole by other Pokémon, especially Toucannon. While fleeing danger, Bounsweet skips along in a way that does not convey its desperation. As a result, no one ever comes to help it. It has been known to drive away enemies by rotating its calyx, but it becomes dizzy afterward.",
