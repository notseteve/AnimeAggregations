  "description" : "Cobalion is known as the Iron Will Pokémon. Cobalion has sky blue fur and two golden horns at the top of its head. It bears a close resemblance to a markhor. It is closely related to Terrakion and Virizion. It can be found at the deep end of the Mistralton Cave after hearing about its legend from an old man dwelling there.\nCobalion is the leader of the Sacred Swordsman and was one of the Pokémon that helped Keldeo learn the true weight of its sword to become part of the Sacred Swordsman. Cobalion is pretty strict, but is also very wise and sometimes speaks in riddles to help his pupils learn on their own.\nLegends say that it, along with Terrakion and Virizion, fought for the rights of Pokémon against the humans that were abusing them. It is notable for being both the eldest and the leader of the trio. Legends also say that it has a heart of steel. Its glare is sufficient to make even an unruly Pokémon obey it.",
