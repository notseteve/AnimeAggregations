  "description" : "Schneizel el Britannia is the Second Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the Prime Minister of Britannia. He is one of the primary antagonists of the series and a strategist on par with Lelouch, as he is the only person whom Lelouch was unable to beat in chess as a child. Schneizel is ruthless and cold as a strategist, willing to sacrifice lives without a second thought to achieve his ends, but he is also very charismatic and caring toward his subordinates. He seems to show disdain for force when it is unnecessary, as he negotiates a peace treaty with the Euro Universe despite dominating them in every military engagement.\nWhen Lelouch becomes Britannia`s 99th Emperor, Schneizel, alongside the Black Knights and other soldiers opposing Lelouch, confront him. Upon Schneizel`s defeat, Lelouch uses his Geass on him to make him follow Zero`s orders, having anticipated that Suzaku would take on the persona after Lelouch dies.",
