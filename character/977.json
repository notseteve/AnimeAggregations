  "description" : "Manectric appears to be a canine Pokémon, (mixed with a lion) in the tradition of Arcanine and Houndoom. It is said to be able to conjure thunderclouds to drop lightning bolts from. It is also a very strong and confident Pokémon as seen in the Pokémon anime episode \"The Electrike Company!\" Manectric`s name is a portmanteau of mane, which is particularly developed in this Pokémon, and electric, which is the basis of its powers, and is also its type. Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of the English words lion and volt.",
