  "description" : "Mismagius is the evolved form of Misdreavus. It can evolve from Misdreavus when it is given the dusk stone. It has the general appearance of a stereotypical witch; with a pointed head similar to a witch`s hat, and a long cloak-like body. It has red jewels around its neck, similar to its pre-evolved form Misdreavus. Mismagius screeches sound like incantations. Those who hear these cries are tormented by hallucinations and headaches, though a select few people will occasionally be brought good luck upon hearing these screeches. Fantina owns a Mismagius on her team in Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl.",
