  "description" : "Hiwatari Sekima is Captain Bravo`s former teammate and one of the Warrior chiefs. He is the leader in charge of Re-extermination squad. He has a bad temper and threatens to kill people, almost never plans things out first, and is willing to use the same tactic the enemy uses to beat the enemy. During the Muto-Assassination arc he said, \"Unreasonable things must be beaten with the same unreasonable tactics.\" After Maruyama, Negoro, and Bravo were beaten, Hiwatari appears in front of Kazuki and co. to kill them. While Bravo tried to stop him, he released a flame storm that engulfed the entire construction yard thus leaving only the two silver skins intact. He went in shock after seeing Bravo sacrificing himself to cover his Silver Skin around Kazuki and Tokiko, and is angered by how Kazuki wants revenge. The two of them engaged in a fierce battle, only to have each of their attacks shielded from the other person by Silver Skin fragments. They were then stopped by Sakaguchi Shousei, the Asia leader of the Alchemy Warriors. Hiwatari is also known as the Alchemy Warrior with the strongest offense with his Buso Renkin Blaze of Glory. Every time he laughs maniacally, it`s indication that he hides the fact he`s sad and mourning as pointed out in his flashback as well as by Shosei. He is one of few people that call Captain Bravo by his real name and shows great respect for him despite how different their ideals are.",
