  "description" : "The God Hand are a powerful group of five demons, each corresponding to a finger or thumb, directly below the Idea of Evil in power and authority. All of them were originally humans who were chosen by the Idea of Evil to serve its purpose of giving reason for humanity`s suffering. They used the Crimson Behelit to sacrifice a large group of their followers in order to transcend their humanity. It is unknown whether there are five Crimson Behelits or whether the same one came to each of them in turn.\nThe God Hand can`t take corporeal form in the mortal plane; if they do appear there, it is a construct, formed by whatever is at hand. They can also appear during an eclipse ceremony where in there is an area that acts as a junction in between the astral realm and the human realm.\nMost of the God Hand`s names are inspired by Science-Fiction novels. It is also worth noting that the design of the God Hand characters shows similarity to Cenobites from Hellraiser movie series, based on Clive Barker novella, of which Miura is believed to be a fan.",
