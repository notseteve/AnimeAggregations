  "description" : "A student in Houjou High School. He is Yuzuru`s master and was born into a very rich familyâ€”\"The Renge Family\" (Lotus Clan). At first, Kai thinks Yuzuru is only a toy for him to play tricks with (and sexually harass), however soon he falls in love with her. Kai does well at all sports (especially tennis and basketball). He also is despicably honest, even though the rest at his high school isn`t, when it comes to the Drops Tournament (though, he does let himself go a bit that way, because he cannot risk to lose Yuzuru). He doesn`t want Yuzuru to cheat, because it`s the only chance he has to have fun and play ball with his classmates (since the Kugeka have really no club activities, and they never play basketball in PE). His academic results are also superb. In the manga, Kai is over-protective of Yuzuru, but loves her dearly. Later he proposes to Yuzuru during a bath, and she accepts.",
