  "description" : "The Fourth Neck, she is a delusional pop idol whose dismal sales (68th, though Reiko constantly taunts her with \"69th\") are partly responsible for her becoming one of the Orochi. She is almost manic in her behavior, constantly trying to impress the other Orochi with her showmanship, but her energetic exterior hides a dark past.\nA flashback scene depicts her lying on a bed next to an older man, with much of her clothing torn; the exact nature of the liaison, as well as the reasons behind it, are left unsaid, although the scene is accompanied by the suggestion that Corona was \"betrayed by [her] dreams\".\nHer mech, Ooube no Senazuchi, nicknamed Final Stage, takes on the forms of a wheel with a demonic eye in its center and of a giant centipede with an anthropoid head and arms.\nIn personal combat, Corona throws lipsticks at her target. This attack is not as harmless as it might sound, since these lipsticks apparently carry a kinetic charge capable of causing explosions.\nThere is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her left breast.",
