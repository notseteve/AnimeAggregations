  "description" : "An artificial Newtype whose goal is to bring peace to a united world. For this goal he assists Nomoa Long in his attempt to use the mobile armor Patulia. Because he is an artificial Newtype, he regularly suffers from the condition called the \"Synapse Syndrome\", where he experiences pain akin to a terrible death. Initially he defeated Garrod with the RMSN-008 Bertigo, severely damaging the Gundam X, but later falling to the upgraded Divider and a recovered Garrod. After the New United Nations Earth is established, he joins an anti-UNE militia in the North American continent, later intercepting a convoy carrying the Freeden Gundams and rescuing the Vulture crew. He later takes part in the final battle and becomes a peace ambassador for his country.",
