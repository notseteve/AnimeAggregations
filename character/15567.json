Kaede`s main love interest is Dylan Yuki, and is the romantic rival of Azumi. Her results to grab his attention are mediocre as a result of her clumsiness. During season one of the anime, she attended school with Mirmo in his realm, but she is very different in her fairy form compared to the normal citizens of the Muglox World, with fairy wings, a pink fairy outfit, and her instrument, a microphone which was destroyed at the end of the first season while she was trying to save Muglox world. In episode 142, she almost died as a shinigami stole her soul for Mirmo`s chocolates. At the season finale of Mirmo de Pon, Katie struggles to fight for Dylan`s love. Unfortunately, Dylan made a decision that broke her heart, by choosing to be with Haruka Morishita. Katie decided to give up her chance of being with Dylan but not her feelings for him. Later on, when Dylan realizes that Katie is the one he really loves, he decided to confess his feelings to her.\nIn the final episode of the anime, Katie loses Mirmo in replacement for her wish to come true, then finds out that Mirmo never made to the Muglox World and received an extreme punishment.
