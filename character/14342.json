  "description" : "The grumpy old grandfather of Heidi lives like a hermit in a small hut on his alm. He has little contact with the inhabitants of the village below and they in return think he is strange and avoid him. When Heidi`s aunt drops her off at his place he is far from happy about it. He soon learns to appreciate Heidi`s joyful, honest way which also makes him more helpful and friendly towards other people.",
