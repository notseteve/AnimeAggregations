  "description" : "First cousin of the three sisters. He occasionally visits the Minami sisters to check up on them and give them their monthly allowance. He often makes blunders and Kana, in contrast to Haruka and Chiaki, feels he`s \"pathetic\". He later starts to feel some resentment towards Fujioka because he feels as if he is closer to the three girls than he should be. He has an on-and-off relationship with a Reiko. His hair is blue in the first series but changed to green in Okawari; his hair is brown in Okaeri.",
