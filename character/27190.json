  "description" : "Dwebble is known as the Rock Inn Pok√©mon. It searches for moderate looking rocks and overtakes it to the core. It will protect the shell with its own body if needed. It is able to spit out a special liquid from its mouth that allows it to cut through rocks steadily.\nIn the 11th episode (A Home for Dwebble!) of the Best Wishes! anime series, Cilan captures a Dwebble. Cilan`s Dwebble later evolves into a Crustle in \"Crisis at Chargestone Cave\" during a battle against Jessie`s Woobat.",
