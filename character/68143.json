  "description" : "Rikugou`s primary role is to be the on-call bodyguard to Seimei but he will leave Seimei`s side to aide Masahiro should he be ordered to. His sense of loyalty is so strong that he was willing to put aside his doubts regarding Masahiro`s abilities and accepted him as Seimei`s successor on little more than his master`s assurances. He differs from the other Shinshou in that he rarely use magical attacks, preferring instead to fight opponents with a barbed spear. He can also use his cape as a shield and create an explosive 360-degree shock wave of air by striking the ground with his weapon. He also has a chain that was used against the corrupted Guren but he overpowered him.\nSource: Wiki",
