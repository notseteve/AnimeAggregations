  "description" : "The self-proclaimed \"Magic Princess\" with gray skin and wings on its back. After Scarecrow continued to fail, he conspired against Dole Isamu, and Devour, who lacked in handpieces, was born from a part of his body. As its name suggests, it changes its body to a mist and moves instantly. Its magical power is so great that even 3 doll knights can`t stand their teeth. Manipulates many abilities such as psychokinesis, transformation, and hypnosis, always smiling with plenty of space, and suffering from Rika with a half-play feeling. However, rather than capturing Rica, she became more interested in the fight against Dole Knights, and a devotee and feud were rushed to recapture Rica. Like Devoul, he is weak and suffers from the music played by his father.",
