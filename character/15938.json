  "description" : "[b]Saito[b] is the leader of the Third Division who is a master of the left hand sword technique and is a skilled swordsman who evens Okita`s skills. He is silent and taciturn but also very loyal, polite, and wise. He often analyzes the situation before attacking to figure out which actions are necessary to complete the mission. Saito left the Shinsengumi apparently to join Itou`s group, but later it turns out that he was commanded by Hijikata to infiltrate Itou`s group for information concerning Itou`s plans. In the anime he is seen making a final charge against the enemy as his comrades are all slain.",
