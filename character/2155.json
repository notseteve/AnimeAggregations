  "description" : "He is Yuu in a future timespace, La`cryma, and is one of the protagonists of the anime. However, though his mission was to find the Dragon Torque, Haruka, Karasu had an alternate reason as he removed his pipeline to remain in our timespace as Haruka`s protector.\nIn his timespace, he failed to save Haruka from death, and thus swore to protect the Harukas of other timespaces from anyone or anything. His devotion is such that even torture and mortal injuries cannot stop him; he even briefly goes mad when she is about to die, triggering the memories of his Haruka`s death. As a result, he brutally kills one of the other Dragon Knights and smashes open a dam, screaming \"Go! Hell calls you!\" He even fights his oldest friend, Isami/Fukurou, almost to the death rather than allow Haruka to be harmed. He is also irritated by the Yuu of our timespace, seeing him as weak and indecisive, although it seems that he despises Yuu for his own inability to save his Haruka. They are actually very similar, with a psychic bond to Haruka, a desperate need to keep her safe, and a tendency towards angst and doubt. Karasu apparently still whittles.",
