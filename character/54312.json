  "description" : "Hiroto`s Watchog is a member of the Pokémon Gulf Coast Relief Corps which operates out of Pokéwood. It is the main supervisor for the team and it main job is to make sure civilians don`t enter the danger zone. If it neglects that and a civilian enters the danger zone during an emergency, the team won`t be able to focus on the rescue operation any more.\nDuring a training exercise, Hiroto`s Watchog used its precognitive abilities to realize that part of the building was about to fall on its other team members. It quickly pushed them all to safety before the piece hit the ground. They were all grateful to be saved but Hiroto`s Watchog wanted to help participate in the rescues instead of just supervising. Hiroto decided to put it through some training exercises to see if it could cope. It did quite well until it came to trying to put out fires where it was unable to effectively do so. Hiroto counseled with Miruhog and the two of them realized that a supervisor is a very important position.",
