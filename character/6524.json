He gave Ayanami the nickname Aya-tan which is a diminutive considering Ayanami is Hyuuga`s superior. Hyuuga shows a happy face most of the time and is very rarely seen not smiling. He is also almost never seen without a lollipop (or candy apple) in his mouth and is always wearing dark sunglasses. He has excellent swordsmanship and is very good at fighting.",
