  "description" : "Ginnosuke is Rumina`s best friend since childhood. He has no special elemental powers, but he is very intelligent although he isn`t exactly what one would refer to as `street smart`. He later uses a very useful weapon that fires elemental attacks. His personality is somewhat timid, but he has a lot of common sense, and can be very fierce if he has to be. Ginnosuke always wears his very thick glasses that change his appearance so much that his friends can`t recognize him without them.",
