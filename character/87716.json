  "description" : "Murase Tonbo is http://anidb.net/ch87717 [Kurusu Kurogo]`s neighbour and best friend, who aids him in creating his kabuki club. He is good with information and can easily find potential candidates for the club or other references for whatever Kurusu needs. He is more serious than Kurusu, but fully supports him. During his early childhood he earned many awards, which in turn generated the ire and envy of his peers, causing them to bully him relentlessly until he passed out in his home from the fear. As a result he moved next to Kurusu with the two becoming close. He acts as the sound and light director of the kabuki club.\nSource: English Wikipedia",
