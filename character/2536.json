Chris returns to the colony just before the first Zeon attack, and quickly becomes a surrogate big sister to her old friend Al. Her current assignment is as a test pilot, fine-tuning the Gundam NT1 and \"training\" its learning computer - a piece of information she keeps from Al, since the Gundam`s presence at Libot is a top military secret.",
