  "description" : "A mysterious magical goddess who has a mission to cleanse evil spirits away and helps people in need. She has an afro and a long broom. Kind of a klutz, she accidentally bumps or tips the piled-up garbage and falls on her, which she lost her memory from shock according to Naomi Hoshina, who took care of her. She recovered her memory when one of the robotized, sphere-shaped garbage collectors, which it was possessed by an evil spirit, discharged an old T.V. set at her, knocking her down almost senseless. Later, she cleanses the evil spirit from the robot by using her magic, when it was about to harm Tsukasa, Riku and Mina.",
