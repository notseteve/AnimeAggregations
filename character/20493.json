  "description" : "Miyamoto Iroha is a young girl of fifteen and a member of the family of Zodiac Masters associated with the snake. The Miyamoto group was once a feared yakuza gang, but its power, repute and membership dwindled under Iroha`s father; his kind nature did not inspire hardened criminals to remain loyal. Iroha, along with her subordinate Hanzou with whom she travels, are the first to attempt the assassination of Koushi. Iroha wants to restore the reputation her family used to have as the most fearful of the twelve Zodiac Masters by killing Koushi, but is hindered by Momoko. Eventually, Iroha develops a crush on Koushi and resolves to find a new path for the Miyamoto family, after Momoko praises her for her fortitude in battle and laments that Iroha should follow the path of an assassin. Iroha eventually develops a close friendship with Momoko and supports her to get closer to Koushi. She even honestly wishes for their success. Iroha has attempted to save money for the resurrection of the clan, but is often troubled by Hanzou, who spends the money selfishly and by the landlady, an old woman who manages to terrify them whenever she demands their rent.",
