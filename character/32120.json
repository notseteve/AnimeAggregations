  "description" : "Nate Mitotsudaira is a knight of Hexagone Fran√ßaise and successor of the Mitotsudaira Clan. Half-human, half-wolf. Although she cannot transform into a wolf form, she possesses the form`s great strength. She uses her special weapon, her silver chains, to great effect.\nBecause of her chivalrous nature and strong sense of duty, Nate feels very protective of the land on the Musashi, which technically falls within her family`s domain.\nShe is against the idea of saving horizon. But after being defeated by a silly method of using Mukai Suzu as a bait, she joins the team.\nSource: kyoukaisen.tumblr.com",
