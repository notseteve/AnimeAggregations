  "description" : "Clumsy yet selfless, Kuzuha Fuuko is a student at the Seito Sannomiya Private School. Despite being accident prone and easily flustered, Fuuko is a very strong willed girl who enjoys motivation and interpersonal satisfaction; even at the expense of her own time and dignity. Much to her own personal anxiety, she takes a tender interest in Hibiki`s drag, which develops into gender confusion and shame; but eventually confident attraction. Her mother died when she was six years old and her father is an unmarried travelling businessman. Fuuko resides at the school dormitories.",
