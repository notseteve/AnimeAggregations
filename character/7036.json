  "description" : "Lieutenant Makoto Yamamoto is another very strait-laced, by-the-books military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze] and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor]`s lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic`s office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier`s code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day.",
