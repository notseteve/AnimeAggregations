  "description" : "After the fall of the Principality, a ragtag fleet of Zeon renegades makes its way to the asteroid belt, taking refuge at the asteroid base Axis. By U.C. 0083, the leadership of the this group has passed to a young woman named Haman Karn, the daughter of a Zeon admiral. Rallying the demoralized Axis renegades to the goal of an eventual triumphant return to the Earth sphere, Haman dispatches an advance fleet to aid Delaz in his master plan. Years later, the seeds of rebellion sown by Operation Stardust will be harvested by Haman and her Axis forces.",
