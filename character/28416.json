When Naruko asked him if he had a crush on Menma, he said, \"Why would I be in love with such an uglyâ€”?\" He had plans to apologize to her the next day, but she died later that night in a drowning accident.\nUnable to forgive himself, Jinta spent the next years of his life in a constant state of gloominess. He became withdrawn and eventually became a hikikomori, or a shut-in. He currently lives with his father. While he is enrolled at the same high school as Naruko, he stopped attending.",
