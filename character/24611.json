She has been studying abroad for some time but returns to Japan to intercept a \"Lost Precious\" that \"Fang\" will be transporting through the city docks. Despite the danger of taking anything that \"Fang\" believes is theirs she does not back down because she believes the contents, which she suspects to be an S rank \"Lost Precious\", will prove her worth to the other \"Lost Precious\" hunters. Initially unable to identify what or whom Rose is, she is shocked when she discovers that Rose is a Red Dragon.",
