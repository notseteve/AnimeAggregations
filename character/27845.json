  "description" : "The Treasurer of the Student Council. She`s the wealthy granddaughter of the Unyuu Group`s leader. She is competent enough to know how to allocate hidden funds for the Student Council, but this is countered by her desires to spend frivolously. She believes money is a means to all ends, from love confessions to winning competitions. Despite this, she considers herself an advocate of proper conduct, and even lectures Tsubaki for his uncivilised actions. Outside of her financial duties, she provides refreshments and first aid supplies to the other Student Council members.",
