  "description" : "Ash met Kikuyo who runs a Pokémon Day Care near Shippo City where she watches over Pokémon eggs. As thanks for helping out her granddaughter Yuri (Isshu) sort out her kindergarten class, she gave Ash a Pokémon egg. Kikuyo told Ash to raise it well so that it would be a great Pokémon. That Pokémon egg later hatched into Ash`s Zuruggu while Ash was en-route to Castelia City.\nWhile resting, Iris`s Kibago noticed that the egg was beginning to glow but got too excited and caused the egg to fall down the nearby cliff and almost get smashed by a rock. Thankfully, Pikachu`s Quick Attack was fast enough to rescue the egg in time. After hatching, Ash`s Zuruggu`s initial attitude was very overbearing as Pikachu attempted to greet it but it used headbutt on Pikachu. Ash then sent out his other Pokémon but Ash`s Zuruggu ended up fighting them as well. Ash tried to capture it after battling his other Pokémon but it refused to be caught by him at that time.\nAfter its encounter with a group of Dentula, Ash`s other Pokémon came to Ash`s Zuruggu rescue as it was greatly over matched. Ash could tell that it was beginning to trust him. Dent then suggested that Ash`s Zuruggu battle Iris`s Kibago as all the other Pokémon were too strong. Both Pokémon agreed but they ended up knocking each other out at the same time. Ash`s Zuruggu was finally caught after the battle as it had grown to like Ash.",
