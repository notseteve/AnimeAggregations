  "description" : "The princess of Maple Land. She gives Seiya some of her magical powers by kissing him. According to Toriken, she is Moffle`s niece and bears a striking resemblance to his sister. Due to some circumstances including her frail body, she cannot leave the garden which is casted with a magic barrier. Latifah was cursed by a wizard, who made her body deficient in Animus, Maple Land`s life force, and the curse renews each year, resetting her memory and age, meaning she has lived as a 14-year old for more than a decade.\nSource: Wiki",
