  "description" : "Kyoya Ootori is a second-year student at Ouran High School and the cunning and sly vice-president of the Host Club. Kyoya is best friends with Tamaki, despite their completely different demeanors. Tamaki tends to call him \"Mom\", or \"Mother\", in reference to Tamaki calling himself \"Daddy\". Kyoya is secretive and intelligent, being able to calculate any benefits that would come out of the Host Club`s misadventures. Despite having quite antagonistic traits, the Host Club wouldn`t be as half as successful without Kyoya`s uptight resourcefulness. Although he doesn`t put an act for the women, he is considered the \"cool type.\" He lives with his father, an affluent zaibatsu owner specializing in hospital management, two brothers that he has to surpass to become his father`s successor, and an older sister who deeply cares about him.",
