Unknown to Chizuru, her father under orders from the Shogunate develops the Water of Life, an elixir that increases the drinker`s healing abilities, speed, and strength yet could turn the drinker into a mindless killing monster called a Rasetsu. At the beginning of the series, she is seen being chased by two men, who were suddenly attacked by two Rasetsu. She witnesses Hajime Saitou kill off the Rasetsu and is then taken to the Shinsengumi headquarters by Toshizou Hijikata, where they allow her to stay, because they too were in search of her father.Chizuru has a secret unknown to herself: she is in fact a pureblood member of the Oni Ichizoku (the Demon Clan), and the head of the Oni of the East is of Yukimura descent.
