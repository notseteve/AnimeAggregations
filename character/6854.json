  "description" : "The third Rozen Maiden doll, and Souseiseki`s older twin. She and Souseiseki are both referred to as \"gardeners\" for their ability to communicate and tend not only to regular plants, but also to the \"soul trees\" of humans.\nDespite her attitude towards Jun, Suiseiseki does care a great deal for him, and her attempts to cover that up usually manifest in the form of more insults. In fact, she cares deeply for everyone in her life, even if she does not show it outwardly. In Rozen Maiden tr√§umend, Suiseiseki stands out among the dolls in that she values her sisters` love more than the goal of becoming Alice. She is one of the few dolls who opposes the Alice Game, and has no intentions of becoming Alice if it means taking her fellow sisters` Rosa Mystica. Suiseiseki and Jun attempt, without much success, to convince the other Rozen Maidens that the Alice Game is a meaningless endeavour.",
