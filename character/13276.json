  "description" : "Has long spiky blonde hair, and constantly wears orange tinted sunglasses. Can usually be seen reading manga. He seems to be the most quiet of the three. Likes Jump, but puts it aside for a while when going to the United States, saying \"Sigh, I guess American comics are alright.\" Compared to the others, Togano is fairly laid-back, preferring to read his manga, often just going along with what Juumonji and Kuroki want.\nHe is additionally the most artistically talented amongst the three (as well as perhaps the entire team except for Hiruma); his drawings sometimes mimic muscular men like those in Fist of the North Star.",
