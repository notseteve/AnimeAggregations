  "description" : "With the Earth Forces exhausted from the aftermath of the Divine Wars, the Aerogator forces decided to make their move by uncloaking their mother ship Neviim and assaulting the Earth with wave after wave of new, previously unseen mobile weapons.\nOne of these mobile weapons was the Zechariah, code named \"Soldier\" by the Earth Federation. The Zechariah was a humanoid mech akin to a foot soldier. Like all Balmar Mobile Weapons, the Zechariah was created from the Zyfluid Crystal, which not only gave the mech the ability to regenerate, but also meant that there could be a near unlimited number of units created. It was the data from machines like the Zecharia stored within Meteor 3 that allowed the federation to discover Extra Over Technology and create their own mobile weapons.\nDuring the Aerogator invasion, the Zechariah would replace the weaker Megillot as the Balmar main forces. While it is not the strongest machine possessed by the Ze Balmary empire, its balance of maneuverability and firepower make it an ideal mass produced frontline weapon. Like all weapons of alien origin, little is known of the Zechariah`s full capacity or weapon systems. It is known that that the machine is typically manned, although it can also be controlled by the same AI system used on the Megillot.",
