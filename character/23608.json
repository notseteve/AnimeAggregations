  "description" : "Solana is a Pokémon Ranger who has climbed up the ranks and is now a rank 10 ranger. She likes to have information on the Pokémon she is helping and is often seen with her Plusle riding on her shoulder.\nAsh and his friends first encountered Solana in the Kanto region as she was investigating the strange growth of some vines in a forest. It ended up that Celebi was there and with Ash`s help they were able to care for the injured Celebi. She once again met up with Ash and friends when she was sent to investigate geomagnetic interference. Upon further investigation it was discovered that Deoxys was in the vicinity and had crashed on the planet in a meteor impact a few years earlier. After befriending Max, Deoxys decided that it wanted to explore more of the world and Solana was able to report back to the Ranger Union that the mission was completed.\nWhile in the Sinnoh region, Ash encountered a rare Riolu that knew how to use Aura Sphere. It had been kidnapped from the Lucario Kingdom. Kellyn and Solana, where sent to track it down and with the strong bond Riolu made with Ash, the Riolu was returned back home.\nIt is said that when at first she met Kellyn in the Sinnoh region, she was jealous of his popularity with the girls because of his ranking and of his looks. She then heard that he didn`t ever notice the girls, and was assigned to work with her. At first, she barley talked to him, she found a liking of him when she saw how good and humble he was when they succeeded.",
