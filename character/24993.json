  "description" : "Kilik is the former Gem King of the original Sleeping Forest. He used to be good friends with Sora and had a crush on Rika. He was considered the most powerful of the original eight kings of Sleeping Forest and in his childhood the most gifted among all the Gravity Children. Due to different opinions regarding the Sky Regalia he split from the original group and gathered other Gravity Children to help him dethrone Sora. After successfully taking the Wind Regalia (and crippling Sora to prevent him from trying to take the Sky Regalia again) he loses his own regalia to an enraged Nike. He seems to take a back seat on fighting, preferring to pull the strings of events rather than to put himself at the forefront.",
