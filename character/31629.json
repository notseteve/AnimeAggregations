  "description" : "Kenyan is a Pokémon Trainer that Ash battled in a field on his way to Raimon City. He only started traveling recently but he`s fully motivated and willing to battle. Kenyan was a bit annoyed by the fact that Ash couldn`t pronounce his name correctly even after repetitively telling him the correct way to say it.\nKenyan sent out his Blitzle to battle Ash`s Oshawott. He was a bit surprised that Ash sent out a Water type Pokémon against him even though he knew that his Blitzle was an Electric type. Kenyan was a bit surprised by Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword defense but he quickly changed tactics a Ash`s Oshawott ended up loosing his scallsword. Ash called time out on their battle and Cilan rescheduled the battle till the next day. Kenyan camped out for the night nearby.\nIn the rematch battle, Kenyan had powered up his Blitzle by using his own power-generating equipment that he made to inject the power into Blitzle. Even after being powered up, Kenyan`s Blitzle lost to Ash`s Oshawott. Kenyan vowed to get stronger and have a rematch with Ash someday.",
