  "description" : "Noel Vermillion is a young girl who was found amidst the burning fields of Ikaruga where she was rescued, and then adopted by the family of Vermillion and is the main heroine of the series. It was because of her outstanding combat activity that she became a high-ranking member of the NOL using the Nox Nyctores revolver Arcus Diabolus: Bolverk, which apparently does not fire actual bullets but rather inflicts damage by creating distortions in dimensional space. Noel also seems to be extremely reliant psychologically on her guns, to the point where she breaks down crying if they are taken away from her. She was made Jin`s subordinate by the NOL, although Jin treated her poorly due to her resemblance of Saya. When Jin rushed off to hunt down Ragna without permission from the NOL, Noel was assigned to stop him and bring him back to his post at the Library.\nSource: Wikipedia",
