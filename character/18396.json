  "description" : "Ace Grit is a 16 year old boy in the Bakugan Resistance. He is a Darkus battler. Because he and Dan Kuso have similar personalities, there is a tension between them. He is a Vestal and has feelings for Mira, although she is rather oblivious to this fact. At first, Ace dislikes the idea of having humans join the Resistance, but after tying in a battle with Dan, he accepts Dan and Marucho into their group. His guardian Bakugan is Percival (evolved into Midnight Percival) and his Trap is Falcon Fly (evolved into Flash Falcon Fly).\nSource: bakugan.wikia.com",
