  "description" : "Morgan is a native of the Enoch Village. He was kind, wise and humble, with a streak of what he admitted to be childishness that liked to chase fairies and the supernatural. He was not a confident one or one to stand up to authority, but he protested the Enochian priest`s ostracism of the party sent to help them profusely. While the group stay and try to solve the troll problem, he lingers around http://anidb.net/ch81093 [Isidro] and tries to offer good advice and assistance, often to the boy`s irritation, but Isidro eventually warms up to him.\nWhen he was young, Morgan sought out a cure for his ailing mother, and in the woods eventually came across a http://anidb.net/ch87815 [witch] he would remember for the rest of his life who offered him her cure.\nMorgan expresses amazement with the group, Isidro and http://anidb.net/ch87813 [Schierke] in particular, when they eliminate the trolls in Qliphoth and retrieve http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca] and http://anidb.net/ch81096 [Farnese]. When the group leave, he takes Isidro aside and confesses that that day in the woods when he was a child, he was merely running from chores and other responsibilities, rather than seeking a cure for his mother, prompting Isidro to focus less on what he wishes he could do and more on what he can do, and persuades him to stop acting like a fantasy hero.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
