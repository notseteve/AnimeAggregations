  "description" : "A rumor of a really strong Pokémon Trainer that had been visiting Melemele Island and was accompanied by a Midnight Form Lugarugan, spread to the Pokémon School. It ended up being Lillie`s brother. Both Skull Gang and Rocket Gang thought it would be worth getting as it was a powerful Pokémon. It defeated Tupp, Zipp and Rapp`s Pokémon in a single attack.\nAfter witnessing that battle, Jessie noted that since they treat evil and justice as the same thing, that Lugarugan which is creepy and cool would be a perfect match for them. Musashi kept getting its name wrong though and kept calling it Luganga. Meowth said that Lugarugan was filled with extreme bloodthirst.",
