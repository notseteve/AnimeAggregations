  "description" : "Iason is not just any Blondie - he is the most perfect, superior and powerful of all of them, the one who talks directly with Jupiter and carries out Jupiter`s commands. He is the head of the Syndicate, Tanagura`s black market for pet trade. He is in love with Riki, a mongrel from the slums, which casts a literally dark shadow over his seeming perfection. Iason becomes interested, obsessed, and finally falls in love with Riki. He has an elegant and calm manner that hides a passionate, ruthless and unforgiving nature. For Riki, Iason is willing to flaunt and break all taboos.",
