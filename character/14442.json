Miyako`s father is a police detective and, desiring to follow in his footsteps, Miyako frequently aids in trying to catch Jeanne. Stubborn and with a fierce temper, Miyako has been friends with Maron since childhood, though she notes during the series that even with her Maron is sometimes distant and that it bothers her. Miyako is initially in love with Chiaki, but gives up on him because she recognizes that he loves Maron. In the anime, Miyako is unaware that Maron is Jeanne.",
