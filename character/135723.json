  "description" : "Kara is a secret society formerly led by http://anidb.net/character/135645 [Ōtsutsuki Isshiki], and later by http://anidb.net/character/125171 [Code].\nThe group is made up of \"Inners\" and \"Outers\", with each of the Inners being in charge of a particular region. Each Inner appears to bear a facial tattoo of a Roman numeral and wears a black hooded cloak with coloured lining, fastened at the right shoulder with a metal pin; all Inners are regarded as completely monstrous in power. The Inners are the backbone of the organisation, as if everyone of them are out of commission, the Outers would effectively cease to function, and Kara would come to an end.\nOuters are individuals who support Kara`s ideology from the outside and complete missions requested by the Inners, acting as conspirators, sleeper agents, and spies. Members include politicians and merchants, some of whom actively work to undermine the rule of the Daimyō and Kage. Outers are also partly responsible for the widespread development and proliferation of Scientific Ninja Tools; as the Outers include engineers and scientists from various villages, they are able to significantly develop and improve the tools before bringing them back to Kara, leading to them possessing the latest in technology and engineering. Regardless of their loyalty, Outers are easily expendable for the organisation.\nThe secret society has accumulated a great deal of wealth and political influence, makes use of Scientific Ninja Tools, and communicates over long range via genjutsu.",
