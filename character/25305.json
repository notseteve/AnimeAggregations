  "description" : "Amano Yukiteru sees his own life as if he were a bystander. His \"No Difference\" diary reflects that attitude. In a detached, neutral tone, the diary records the future changes in his surroundings every couple of minutes. This gives Yukiteru timely, detailed entries of the future around him and is perhaps the one of the most accurate diaries revealed so far. Its major flaw is that nothing short of a DEAD END will make the diary record anything about Yukiteru himself.\nDespite his severe lack of social skills, Yukiteru, nicknamed Yuki, is a fairly normal middle schooler who has gotten in way over his head in Deus`s survival game. He has been marked by Deus as the one who has triggered impossible events and great changes to occur in the future. For that same reason, he is also viewed by the other diary holders as being the most likely to win the game, and is therefore the most dangerous player who must be taken out. Yukiteru possesses remarkable accuracy in throwing darts, which he practices every morning with several dartboards in his room. He prefers to eliminate the other holders by destroying their diaries utilizing his darts instead of using the simpler method of outright killing them with sharp, pointy objects; possibly because he is one of the few people who is actually sane.",
