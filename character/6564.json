  "description" : "He is a friend of http://anidb.net/ch6562 [Kusuda]. Sogabe is a bit of a delusional character, as well as a little narcissistic. He likes http://anidb.net/ch6560 [Nao] and tries to get close to her to create an opportunity for her to confess to him. He shows his insecurities when Nao shows interest towards http://anidb.net/ch8890 [Yukito Renjou], an artist and graduated student from their school. He runs away from home because of this (although only for two days) with Kusuda and http://anidb.net/ch6561 [Mamoru].",
