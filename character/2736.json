  "description" : "The grandfather of Yoshimori and the 21st head of the Sumimura family. Shigemori is a very hot-headed man and who often battles it out with the Yukimura Tokiko next door about the subject of the true successor. This has ranged from insults to battles conducted in midair. He also enjoys hitting Yoshimori on the head with his Legitimate Successor`s Chop when he deems Yoshimori to be lazy and not hardworking enough to compete with the Yukimuras. Under Shigemori`s blustery fa√ßade, he seems to care a lot about his family and Tokiko`s wellbeing.[Spoiler] One bone of contention with him was that Sumimura Masamori had managed to enter the Urakai, whom he heavily distrusts and dislikes. However, he had apparently given up trying to dissuade Masamori from continuing on working in the Urakai, telling Masamori that that would be his own way of protecting Karasumori. It is alluded to that Shigemori is a highly skilled Kekkaishi. Masamori, a highly skilled Kekkaishi in his own right had informed Shigemori that he was no where near his level when Shigemori had complimented him. In the anime, during Kokubourou`s first wave of attack, Shigemori was portrayed drawing up an enormous Kekkai around the house and creating shikigamis even after dispatching Shion`s lackeys without any signs of exhaustion; and also made a kekkai strong enough to block the nine tail demon fox princess`s initial personal attack on Karasumori.[/Spoiler]\n(Wikipedia)",
