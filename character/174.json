  "description" : "Wigglytuff is a relatively large pink balloon-like Pokemon with a white underbelly, large blue baby-like eyes, a pair of large rabbit ears, and a twisty tuft of pink hair on its forehead. It evolves from Jigglypuff through a Moon Stone. In fact, it`s remarkably similar to its pre-evolved form, Jigglypuff, except the ears have grown larger and it now maintains an \"oval\" shape. Wigglytuff`s eyes are always covered by a thin layer of tears, so that if any dust gets into Wigglytuff`s eyes, it is quickly cried away. In the games, Wigglytuff`s fur is described to be \"sublime\", so much so that if two of them come into close contact with each other, they are difficult to separate. In the television series, Wigglytuff is generally accepted as the most powerful Pokemon.",
