  "description" : "The SLV-111 Daedalus was built as a semi-submersible assault carrier deployed by the U.N. Forces in the ocean surrounding South Ataria Island (crash site of the Alien StarShip-1). The ship`s main feature was a collapsible ramp extending from the bow of the ship outward, designed to load the Destroid series vehicles and then promptly sortie Destroids upon arrival at an enemy base. Both the Daedalus and the aircraft carrier http://anidb.net/ch48774 [Prometheus] were sea going vessels that became caught in the desperate space fold escape of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] in 2009. The Daedalus endured the deep space environment and was docked to the starboard side of the SDF-1 Macross shortly thereafter. The ship remained docked with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] until the Defensive Battle of Macross City in January 2012.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/carrier-daedalus.htm",
