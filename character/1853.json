  "description" : "Giratina, known as the Renegade Pokémon, is one of the legendary Pokémon that premiered in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Giratina represents the Dimensions (or perhaps inter-dimensional travel, because space and time, which lie under the control of Palkia and Dialga respectively, are dimensions in themselves). Giratina is described in the Pokémon video games as a creature that lives in a world on the reverse side of the human world. This area is in a cemetery-like ruin in the depths of Turnback Cave, a place where the dimensional boundaries are said to be distorted, and dead Pokémon are able to enter the physical world. Giratina has a long, platinum-colored, segmented body with six legs, and has ghostly wings with spikes. Giratina is featured prominently in the upcoming film `Giratina and the Sky`s Warrior` (Giratina to Sora no Hanataba: Sheimi) and in the game Pokémon Platinum where it has a new form called \"Origin Forme\" (オリジンフォルム), which is similar to its regular form except it has a slightly different face, wing shape, and spikes in place of legs, becoming more serpentine.\nGiratina is infamous as an extremely durable wall, with astronomical defensive statistics. Its Origin Forme trades its defenses for improved offenses, but it is limited to the Platinum Orb as a hold item.\nGiratina`s Another Forme looks like a basilisk, it has a beak-like mouth, it has a crown on the head, it has red eyes, it has big spikey wings, it has six legs, a serpent tail, and a bird-like cry.",
