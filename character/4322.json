  "description" : "He is very short for a boy, standing 156 cm tall. The average height for a male in Japan is 171cm. Like Koizumi, Ootani`s surname (roughly, \"big valley\") is a pun on his diminutive stature, and he can be thoughtless and rude; at heart, however, he is kind and a little silly. Ootani is also the star player of the school basketball team.",
