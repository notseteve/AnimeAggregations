  "description" : "Electivire, known as the Thunderbolt Pokémon, is the evolution of Electabuzz that is first introduced in the last episode of Pokémon Battle Frontier. Electivire`s back has a symbol that looks similar to a socket outlet, similar to how a previous form of it, Elekid, resembled a plug. It has red eyes and also seems to resemble the yeti or sasquatch. The small red parts on the end of its pair of tails resemble red LEDs. According to its Pokédex entry, it can shoot 20,000 volts of electricity out of its tails.\nAn Electivire owned by Gary Oak was first seen on the final episode of Pokémon: Battle Frontier. He used his Electivire, which he got in Sinnoh, to beat Ash Ketchum`s Pikachu in a one-on-one battle. He later used it to help Ash protect a group of Shieldon from Hunter J.",
