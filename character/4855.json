  "description" : "The oldest sister of the Yoshikawa family. She can use magic, and loves cooking for her brother and sisters. She has long lilac-coloured hair, often tied back with green ribbons. She is very protective of her brother Haruo, and was immediately suspicious of Ayumi`s intentions (which were justified). The others often accuse her of having a brother complex, which is not entirely unjustified. As a toddler she subliminally brainwashed Haruo in his sleep by chanting \"Big Brother and Maika together forever\" repeatedly, and her usually caring and ladylike-personality is replaced by a possessive jealousy whenever any female tries to seduce her brother. She is even able to transform into a green-skinned demon when she becomes especially jealous.",
