  "description" : "Ash`s Fletchling was spotted in the Route 4 forest when it stole the Pok√©mon food that Bonnie was trying to feed to Clemont`s Dedenne. Ash noted that the Fletchling was fast and that he wanted to catch it after seeing it move so quickly.\nInitially, Ash`s Froakie wanted to battle but Ash told it not to be reckless and to let Pikachu handle the battle. Ash`s Froakie wanted to punish Yayakoma because Bonnie was looking so sad after trying to feed Dedenne. After working on a strategy, they picked a rocky area where Ash`s Froakie could combine the differences in elevation with Ash`s Froakie jumping power to achieve even higher levels of mobility to counter Fletchling flying speed. After an intense battle, Ash captured Fletchling and the two of them agreed to be friends from that day on. Bonnie forgave Ash`s Fletchling for stealing the food but gave it an Oran Berry as a sign of reconciliation.",
