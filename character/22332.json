  "description" : "Misty`s Staryu is one of the powerhouses on her water Pok√©mon based team and has seen action in numerous battles. This is one of her three original team members which also had Misty`s Goldeen and Misty`s Starmie, its final evolved form. The attacks it was commonly seen using were Water Gun and occasionally Rapid Spin.\nMisty`s Staryu`s personality is largely a mystery due to the fact that it has no face and thus no facial expressions but has proven its self to be very dependable time and time again.",
