  "description" : "Greta is the adopted human daughter of Shibuya Yuuri and Wolfram von Bielefeld. Unknown to herself, she is a princess of the fallen kingdom of Zoracca. Her mother, the Queen of Zoracca, sent her to be raised by her uncle, the King of Svelera, before the kingdom fell. At first Greta tried to kill Yuuri by posing as his illegitimate daughter because her uncaring foster parents hated the Maou and she believed she could earn their love by assassinating him. Not much later Yuuri forgives and adopts her. Wolfram follows suit, reasoning that as Yuuri`s fianc√© he is also Greta`s parent.",
