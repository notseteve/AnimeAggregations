Natarle is stern and operates by the book, though she is willing to do almost anything to reach a certain end, even when it conflicts with Captain Ramius. Nevertheless, Natarle is a superb tactical analyst with keen judgment and a knack for swift decision-making, which made her a valuable asset to the Archangel.

After witnessing the actions of Muruta Azrael of Blue Cosmos, Natarle chooses to defy the Earth Alliance which results in her and Azrael`s death",
