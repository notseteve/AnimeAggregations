  "description" : "A cat and Fatora`s personal pet. Unlike felines of Earth, however, the cats of El-Hazard are able to stretch and wrap around humans, becoming a highly durable living armour. Ura is loaned to Makoto while he impersonates Fatora, and the cat saves his life on several occasions. As armour, Ura is at least strong enough to withstand a single blast of energy from Ifurita. He is also capable of limited human speech. A similar cat is seen around Rune Venus briefly, but is not named or otherwise shown again.",
