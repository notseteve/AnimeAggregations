It turns out that Hartmann was trying to make Dieter into another Johan, a kind of leader that had not been produced from Kinderheim 511 before. Dieter later becomes more optimistic after being saved by Doctor Tenma from Hartmann`s physical and mental abuse. He follows Dr. Tenma in his search for Johan, partially to prevent Tenma from becoming a murderer, but also because he is fond of Tenma.",
