  "description" : "The largest conventional Zentradi warship seen in Space War I, a Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class vessel was the lead warship of the Bodol Zer Main Fleet`s 67th Glruimual class branch http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] (Adoclass) Fleet. A medium-scale fleet command battleship, the original design for this class of vessel was completed during development competitions in the early years of the Schism War. Over four kilometers in length, these ships are bristling with numerous weapon emplacements and carry a large complement of Zentradi mecha.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], the Zentradi in command of the Nupetiet-Vergnitzs, was on a search and destroy mission to find Supervision Army survivors when his fleet came upon residual traces of a Supervision Army gun destroyer`s defold reaction some ten light years away from Earth. The gun destroyer was naturally the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led his fleet in an operation to intercept it. When the gun destroyer was found completely reconstructed, http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] led many relentless missions to capture the ship, including a daring operation using his own Nupetiet-Vergnitzs vessel as bait.Though http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s Nupetiet-Vergnitzs was damaged repeatedly during Space War I, the ship remained fully operational during the war and even survived battle against the Bodol Zer Main Fleet. Repaired following the end of the war, the vessel was re-commissioned thereafter and became the first battleship of the New United Nations Forces in December 2012.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/nupetiet-vergnitzs.htm",
