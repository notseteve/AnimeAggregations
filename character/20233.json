  "description" : "His given name is Conrart; Yuuri nicknames him \"Conrad,\" which is \"closer to English\" and easier to pronounce with a Japanese tongue. Conrad is the second child of the previous Maoh, Cecilie von Spitzweig. His father was human (also considered the greatest swordsman in the Demon Kingdom; Dan Hiri Weller). His ancestor, Lawrence Weller, fought alongside the Original King during the war against Soushu. On his 16th birthday, he decided to live as a Mazoku instead of a human. He fought on the front lines for the Mazoku during a war against the humans. He and Yozak are the only two survivors of the Battle of LÃ¼tenburg. He was also put in charge of the soul at the request of Suzanna Julia von Wincott, that was to be the new Maou, and brought it safely to Earth so that it could be born.\nFurthermore, he was the one who was the inspiration for Yuuri`s name. He stated that \"Where I come from, the month of July is called Yuuri\", which made Yuuri`s mother name him Yuuri because he was born in July. For this reason, Yuuri dubs him `Nazukeoya`, which is a person who names someone (Conrad is also known as Yuuri`s Godfather by his mother). Cecilie named the blue flowers she grew \"Conrad Stands Upon Earth\".",
