  "description" : "(From Shakespeare`s Twelfth Night) - GOTT ES Member (C Class), apparent age 18, partner to Viola. Special ability: \"Driver\".\nCesario is the older partner of Viola. He is seen to be a mostly silent person, almost never speaking out loud. Instead, he is usually seen communicating to Viola by whispering in her ear. Cesario seems to prefer communicating with body language instead of voice. He is often an indecisive person, usually on the losing side of his arguments with Viola. His power, \"Driver\", has no use on its own but when in contact with Viola, it serves as a source of energy for her ability.",
