  "description" : "Along with Leo Aiolia, Saga disguised as the Pope was the first Gold Saint that Masami Kurumada introduced in his manga, although their rank wasn`t revealed until later volumes. In his first appearance, Saga presided the event in which Pegasus Seiya acquired the status of Saint. In the anime adaptation, he was introduced in identical manner, in episode 1.\nSaga managed to put himself in control of the sanctuary treacherously for many years after killing Pope Shion, the original Grand Pope of Sanctuary by stealing his identity.\nSaga is often described by other characters as someone with the kindness of an angel but with the darkness of a demon. This ambivalence ended up creating a split personality: a good Saga that was extremely loyal to Athena and an evil one that keeps control of the body most of the time and killed the previous Pope to steal his place. When it takes control of Saga`s body, his hair turns from blond to jet-black (the color schemes were altered for the anime, in which Saga`s normally blue hair turned light grey). Saga`s two \"sides\", can also communicate between them : in a dialogue the good Saga reproaches his evil \"side\" to have forced him to hurt Athena.",
