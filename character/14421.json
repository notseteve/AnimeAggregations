  "description" : "Mika is extroverted and hyperactive. Her over-the-top antics usually result in her being yelled at by Ayumi and Akane (rabbits have a history of rivalry with turtles and foxes). When she was a rabbit, she died of loneliness, which may account for her current personality of being an attention seeker. Mika is in the Senior rank. Her name means new moon, alluding to the myth of the rabbit of the moon. Her color image is orange.\nUnlike most of the other angels, she is very clearly romantically attracted to Gorou. Her hairstyle represents a rabbit`s ears.",
