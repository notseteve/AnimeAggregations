  "description" : "Maes Hughes is an old friend of http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang]`s. He works in the military`s intelligence division, but spends much of his time using the military phone lines to brag to Mustang about his family. After his daughter, http://anidb.net/ch10890 [Elicia], is born, he fawns about how cute and talented she is and bombards others with pictures of her when he sees them. Despite his over-the-top comical tendencies, Hughes is a valuable ally to Mustang`s goal of becoming FÃ¼hrer, supplying whatever classified intelligence that may be beneficial. He has also been shown to be a capable fighter, skilled with throwing knives. His general understanding of others` emotions and desire to help them similarly gains the affection of the Elric brothers and their friend http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell], as he always offers advice or hospitality to them when they need it.\nSource: Wikipedia",
