  "description" : "Cobra`s signature weapon is his Psycho-gun, a cybernetic arm-laser which is connected to his brain and capable of targeting enemies without needing a line-of-sight. This allows him to defeat most foes with ease, but some are not so vulnerable to the laser itself; the gun also drains Cobra`s mental energies after extended use. For backup he carries an old-fashioned Magnum revolver.",
