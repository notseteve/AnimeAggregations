  "description" : "Yukino and Soichiro`s lazy and girl-crazy friend, very handsome and popular. Although bright enough to be accepted to the selective Hokuei High School, Hideaki is a terrible student, and spends most of his time surfing or chasing girls. Hideaki and Soichiro are considered the two most handsome boys in school, and while Soichiro is largely indifferent to the attention, Hideaki makes the most of it. During their school`s annual culture-fest, Hideaki`s class mounts a \"Hideaki Asaba Dinner Show\" which is a big hit with all the girls, but gives Yukino and Soichiro the creeps.",
