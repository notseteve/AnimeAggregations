  "description" : "Touta Matsuda is the youngest member of the Kira investigation team. Matsuda has the drive to match the other members of the team, but his lack of experience sometimes hinders the investigation. He is described as a \"typical young man\" who is \"easy to get along with\" and feels \"very excited about trends and gossip;\" often listening in on Light`s intimate conversations with Misa and later Takada for the sake of gossip rather than the investigation.",
