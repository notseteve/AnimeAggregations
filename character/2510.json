  "description" : "A 20-year-old samurai of the Shimizu family, and a member of the Kairoushuu. He is rumoured to have single-handedly massacred everyone in his clan except for his younger sister, Raimei when he was 15 and then joined the Kairoushuu. He is rather easygoing, but he takes his responsibilities very seriously. He admits that he is not adept at photography, usually messing up the photo. Also, though he claims to be a good driver, he once drives himself and the rest of his teammates into a river. Running jokes about him are his questionable fashion sense and implications that he is a sadist.",
