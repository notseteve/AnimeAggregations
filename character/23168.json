  "description" : "The personal mobile armor of Phantom Pain commander Neo Roanoke. In addition to its linear guns and missile launchers, the Exus also carries a set of Gunbarrels based on the remote weapons used by the Moebius Zero. Its fighting strength is thus remarkably high, and it can battle several ZAFT mobile suits simultaneously. However, this mobile armor is designed exclusively for space combat and can`t be used in Earth`s atmosphere.",
