  "description" : "Yuusaku is a male student in Ryuuji`s class, and is his best friend. He is the vice-president of the student council, the class representative, and captain of the boy`s softball club at school. Yuusaku wears glasses, and has a diligent personality. He thinks he is poor at talking to girls, though Ryuuji observes otherwise; Yuusaku likes the student council president Kanou Sumire. Despite being on the student council, he is in violation of riding a motorcycle to school. A running gag is that he will appear out of nowhere behind Taiga and Ryuuji when they are discussing a \"plan of attack\" to get their crushes.",
