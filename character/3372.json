  "description" : "Bianchi is Gokudera`s half-sister; they share the same father. Bianchi, known as \"Poison Scorpion Bianchi\" in the Mafia underground, specialises in poison cooking. Since she, herself, is immune to her own cooking, she does not see anything wrong with the food she gives others. Even though they seem to have a strained relationship, she has shown great concern for Gokudera if he is injured, fighting, or suffering from stomach aches, which she does not realise are caused by her. She is in love with Reborn, who was a former associate of hers, and wants to kill Tsuna to free up Reborn`s schedule, though refuses to kill him for the benefit of others. Bianchi always states that \"Love\" is the strongest force of all.",
