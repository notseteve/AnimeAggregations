  "description" : "Sumeragi Kururu is the leader of the current Tool Toul To and Pledge Queen. Initially, she was a new member keen on becoming Ikki`s Tuner. Although shy around Ikki at first, she becomes devoted to him after witnessing his anger over Simca`s attack. Kururu may be in love with Ikki as hinted in chapter 145. She does not wear ATs, but as the leader of Tool Toul To, she is a genius in repair, construction, and maintenance of ATs. In Ikki`s battle with Ringo, Kururu identified the sound of Ikki`s ATs, arrived at the battle in time to intercept Ikki as he was falling towards the river, and rebuilt his ruined ATs in midair in less than three seconds. She originally rebuilds the Wind Regalia for him, though it is stolen and given to Sora. She eventually becomes determined to create the new Storm Regalia for him. The Pledge Regalia allows her to utilze the bodies of other tuners through the `Infinite Scale`, enabling them to build, repair, and tune ATs as quickly as the Pledge Queen.",
