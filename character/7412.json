  "description" : "A bizarre replica of My Melody, Kuromi is her rival. She is also a rabbit and wears a black joker`s hat with a pink skull at the center of her forehead. The skull`s facial expression changes to match Kuromi`s mood. Wielding a magical artifact called the Melody Key, which is infused with dark dream-corrupting powers, Kuromi is trying to collect 100 Black Notes in order to resurrect the Spirit of Dark Power, in the hopes that it will destroy her enemies, especially My Melody. Her tail is a weak point wherein she would fall unconscious if someone were to step on it.\nShe is an escaped prisoner from Mari Land. It was later revealed that Kuromi committed crimes like stealing bread in order to feed Baku`s poor family. When Kuromi was on trial, Baku tried to convince the judge that he too was responsible. But Kuromi claimed that Baku was lying, so that her friend wouldn`t share a similar fate.\nWhat started her grudge towards Melody was an incident where Melody unknowingly tore a page from her journal to wipe Piano the sheep`s nose. Since then, Kuromi has been writing down on it all the mishaps and unfavorable moments that Melody has caused her (accidentally). More than 3,000 events written, Kuromi sometimes reads them in front of Melody.\nKuromi is the leader of a biker gang known as \"Kuromi`s 5.\" Other members include a purple cat named Nyanmi, a pale orange dog named Wanmi, a white fox named Konmi, and a grey and white rat named Chumi. They all wear black and drive around in a menacing fashion.\nJust like Uta, Kuromi has affections for Hiiragi. Her affections for him seem somewhat stronger than Uta`s however.",
