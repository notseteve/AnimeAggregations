She is the childhood friend of Ooyama Takeru and has romantic feelings for him often not caring when her body is revealed in front of him. She shares a room with Ooyama Takeru, Himegami Kodama and Kushiya Inaho.\nShe wields one of the eight legendary maken, \"Murakumo\" meaning \"Gathering Clouds\". Her maken allows her to turn her element into photons around the blade. Murakumo`s seal cannot be broken unless it reacts to opponents on par with its power. However, Haruko was able to unleash a little of the maken`s power through her anger.",
