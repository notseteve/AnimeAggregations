  "description" : "Madame Red, born Angelina Durless, is Ciel`s aunt. As her title suggests, she is known for her red appearance and clothing. Initially she hated her red hair, which she inherited from her father, until Ciel`s father stated he liked it. Angelina fell in love with him and became distraught when she found her sister was marrying him. Madame Red later married Baron Barnett, who treats her lovingly and gently, stating that he does not mind that she harbors feelings for another. She obtained a medical license against the wishes of her parents and practices at the Royal London Hospital. After a carriage accident in which her husband was killed, her womb and unborn child had to be removed. This causes her great strife as a doctor because she regularly performs abortions on prostitutes as they believe having a child is troublesome. She later kills her patients with Grelle Sutcliffe and the two become known as Jack the Ripper. However, she cannot kill Ciel as she holds him as dear as her own son and because of this, she is killed by Grelle.",
