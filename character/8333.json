The king, Pokota`s father, became very ill. Rezo, the Red Priest, appeared and sealed the residents of Taforashia in sleeping chambers to isolate them until a cure was found. Rezo sealed Pokota`s human body in a chamber, but he used a magical vase to transfer Pokota`s spirit into his current form, an animal-like creature about 2 feet tall.\nPosel has long, lavender hair with a mohawk in the front. He wears a gold hoop in his left ear, and his clothes are for the most part green.",
