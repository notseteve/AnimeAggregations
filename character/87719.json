  "description" : "Ebihara Jin is a descendant from a family of kabuki performers. He has been practising kabuki since he was four years old, but he still feels his performance is lacking. He greatly admires his grandfather who is a famous performer, \"a living national treasure\", and aspires to be with him despite the fact his grandfather wants Jin to develop his own sense and broaden his horizons. He takes kabuki very seriously, rejecting http://anidb.net/ch87717 [Kurusu Kurogo]`s proposal to join his club. He considers Kurusu`s kabuki club to be a \"joke\".\nSource: English Wikipedia",
