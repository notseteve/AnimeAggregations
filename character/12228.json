  "description" : "Armbrust (German for \"Crossbow\") is 36 years old and an Auditor for the Global Union. He is sent to observe Éclair and Lumière on their missions at the outset of the series.\nCalm and collected and somewhat of a ladies` man, Armbrust is frequently the target of Éclair`s distrust, in spite of his efforts and good intentions. Unlike her partner, Lumière frequently comes to his defense. Later it is revealed that Armbrust is actually an S Class ES Member whose partner is Pfeilspitze (also known as Mercredi). His ever-present briefcase represents his special ES ability (codenamed \"Black Box\").",
