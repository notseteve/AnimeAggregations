Tomoya first met her in the library`s reference room while trying to find a place to sleep. He is immediately greeted by her hospitality, and returns the next day with Youhei due to Youhei`s insistent. Ever since, Tomoya and Youhei start to enter the library reference room routinely. She later avails Tomoya and Youhei an instruction book for magical spells for them to try. Most of them are in the favor of Tomoya, involving the girls they met.\nShe has friends outside of her school, which turns out to be delinquents from other schools. She made friends with the delinquents through her brother, Kazuto, who is also a delinquent, after his death trying to save a friend from an accident. She sees Tomoya as her older brother, who has a similar personality as her dead brother. Tomoya learns briefly about the light orbs through Yukine, which are called the symbol of happiness. The light orbs are actually the people`s feelings inside the city Tomoya is staying.\nAccording to the script writers, Yukine was originally intended to be one of the heroines of Clannad, but as her story did not reach their expectations, she was made into a secondary character. However, she was still depicted on the regular edition cover of the PC release, and on the PlayStation 2 release which used the same art as the regular PC release.",
