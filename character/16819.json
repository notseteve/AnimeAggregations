  "description" : "Inoue is the leader of the gang http://anidb.net/ch1164 [Kagura] joined when she first came to earth. Inoue found Kagura and he knew in an instant that she is a descendant of the http://anidb.net/ch10785 [Yato clan] so he offered to give her food in exchange for the services that Kagura would provide for him, which was to fight other gangs that were competing with Inoue`s own gang, Punch Perm.\nKagura found out later that she was fooled by Inoue and she later left the group after beating Inoue and shaving his afro. Afterwards, she became a member of the http://anidb.net/ch10409 [Yorozuya]. Inoue appears wearing a pair of sunglasses and an afro, the trademark of his gang.\nSource: Gintama Wiki",
