  "description" : "Ari is an Elf and Lukshana`s fianc√©. He and Lukshana went to the De Ornielle mansion to capture Tiffania and end up kidnapping Saito as well. He shows the capability of using magic swords. Ari reluctantly goes with the humans after escaping the elves territory with Saito and Tiffania. As they went to Tabitha`s coronation in Gallia, Ari quickly learns that humans are not much different when compared to elves. Later, Ari and Guiche get along after Ari sees that Guiche`s relationship with Montmorency is similar to his own with Lukshana.\nSource: Wiki",
