  "description" : "Pidgeotto, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Pidgey takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeotto is only acquired when a Pidgey grows past experience level 18 and evolves into a Pidgeotto. A Pidgeotto is extremely territorial, generally claiming a large area with its nest built in the center. Full of vitality, it constantly patrols its territory, mercilessly attacking intruders. They fly about in circular patterns while hunting, and can spot the movements of their prey on the ground no matter how high they fly. The Pidgeotto attacks with its wickedly sharp talons and carries its prey, including Exeggcute and Magikarp, back to its nest from as far as 60 miles away - or more.\nPidgeotto was the second Pokémon Ash caught in the beginning of his career, eventually evolving into Pidgeot.",
