  "description" : "Ellie is the granddaughter of Lisa. She used to play with her at her grandma`s mansion located near Shoyo City in the Kalos region. Ellie confirmed to Nyasper that Lisa had died and was the reason she was no longer at the mansion.\nJust before she died, Lisa befriended a Nyasper and gave it a pendant she often wore. She played with Nyasper and gave it food as well. Nyasper returned one day to give the pendant back but Lisa wasn`t there. Nyasper decided to wait until she returned. It wasn`t until Ellie arrived to do renovations of the mansion that it realized what had happened. Ellie thought that the pendant looked good on Nyasper and she told it to keep it. Ellie took Nyasper with her in her car to visit the grave of her grandma.",
