  "description" : "Schierke is http://anidb.net/ch87815 [Flora]`s disciple and a witch. She is a member of http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts]` Traveling Party. She is mature for her age, quiet, and withdrawn.\nAs a disciple, she was very respectful towards her mistress and was deeply saddened upon her demise. Presently, she gets along well with most of Guts` party, as well as with total strangers such as http://anidb.net/ch87814 [Sonia] and Isma. As a result of being rather sheltered throughout her childhood, she is disdainful towards the human world and the Holy See`s religion, but finds life outside of the forest bearable while traveling with her companions.\nAlthough kind and usually friendly, she sees http://anidb.net/ch81093 [Isidro] as an incompetent monkey and regularly mocks his intelligence, causing some friction between the two which frequently lends itself to comical situations. Initially, Schierke held a disliking for Guts, however this was largely due to her not understanding him. She has since developed an infatuation with him akin to a schoolgirl crush, although their relationship more closely resembles that of a father and daughter.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
