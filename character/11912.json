  "description" : "Akiyuki`s Mother. A strong-willed woman who cares deeply about her son and her, typically, overworking husband. Although the relationship between husband and wife is strained because of his frequent absence from the household, she continues to at least speak with him for the sake of their child. Upon discovering that her son Akiyuki had gone missing, she strongly resolved to try and find him, regardless of whether or not her husband was compassionate enough to abandon his work to help her. She has a very familiar relationship with Haru, and seems to be able to entrust his well-being to her, when later she was able to confirm that her son is indeed alive.",
