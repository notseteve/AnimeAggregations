  "description" : "An antagonist in the Witchblade series. Tatsuoki Furimizu is the head of the NSWF. He is affectionately known as \"Father\" by his Neogene \"daughters\" and the orphans in his care. In his youth, he was a brilliant scholar as well as an efficient administrator. In his old age, however, Furimizu has become reclusive and secretive in his quest to acquire the Witchblade. While kind and soft-spoken in public, he is rather cold-hearted and deranged in reality. He is completely single-minded in pursuit of his goals, and shows no concern for the physical and emotional well-being of those who serve him.",
