  "description" : "Valkenhayn R. Hellsing is one of the Six Heroes and Rachel`s elderly butler and trusted advisor who has served the Alucard family line for generations. He possesses a sharp wit and is concerned for Rachel`s well-being. Valkenhayn seems to be worried about Rachel associating with things below her class (particularly Ragna, although others might apply), but he always acts in a sophisticated and gentlemanly manner. Judging from comments frequently dropped by Rachel, he seems to have once been a vigilante himself. He seems to know Terumi well enough to recognize him on sight, even though Terumi can change shape.\nSource: Wiki",
