  "description" : "Harada Rika is the founder and manager of Harada Design. She also ran it with her husband until he died in a car accident that happened on the opening night of one of the stores they designed. This accident also left her badly scarred on her back, and has damaged her legs so she is unable to walk for long periods without the help of a cane and medicine. During college, Egami Rika had been known for being a talented artist, but also very cold and aloof. Harada, Rika`s eventual husband, befriended her and she began to live in the apartment Harada and Shuuji shared. The three were very close friends and continued to live together until Harada and Rika got married and founded Harada Design. She is from the city of Otaru in Hokkaidou.\nWhen Professor Hanamoto believes that his presence will hinder Rika`s recovery, he sends Mayama to help her, believing that Mayama would be the least likely to intrude on other people`s business. However, as Mayama tends to Rika`s injuries, he develops feelings for her. Rika knows that Mayama likes her, but pushes Mayama away because she doesn`t want to hurt him. It was unclear whether Rika reciprocates the feelings that Mayama has for her, but later chapters of the manga and the first episodes of the second series seem to imply that she does. Later in the series, it appears that Rika finally opens her heart to Mayama after a shock ending sequence where Mayama`s feelings finally flood out.\nSource: Wikipedia",
