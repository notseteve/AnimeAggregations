  "description" : "Miyamoto Konatsu is a short, earnest girl who loves to sing and dance. She was previously affiliated with the choir club until she had a falling out with their supervisor, who prevented her from singing due to an incident a year prior when she was attacked by stage fright during their recital. After this incident, Konatsu began training herself by performing in the public park. She decides to create her own club so she can sing in front of the school. When this club falls short on members, she combines it with Taichi`s badminton club to form the Choir and sometimes Badminton Club.\nSource: Wikipedia",
