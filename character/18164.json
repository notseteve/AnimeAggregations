  "description" : "Inaba Touma is a prep school student who is struggling to get into Keio University after repeated failures. When he goes once again to take the entry exams, it`s love at first sight (for him, at least) when he meets Mieko Yotsuba. When she makes it in but he does not, he decides to lie to her and says that he was accepted. He lives with his cousin, Urara Kosuga, who has feelings for him and affectionately calls him \"Tonma-chan\" though he is too dense and love-struck for Mieko to notice.",
