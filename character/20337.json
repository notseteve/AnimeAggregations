  "description" : "The young king of Small Shimaron who asks Yuuri to call him Sara. He is extremely beautiful and usually said to be someone who`s beauty could rival that of Wolfram. At first glance seems soft-spoken and kind-hearted. He`s already at adult age but still uses `boku` which is usually used by young males when referring to themselves. He can`t remember much about his parents. He has the power of hypnosis, which he tried to use on Yuuri, but with no effect. The two become friends despite misgivings Yuuri`s friends have concerning the human king. Yuuri wants very badly to become very close friends with Sara.",
