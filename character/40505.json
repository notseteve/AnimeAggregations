  "description" : "As Ash and Iris walked into the battle area of the club, they watched as Andre defeated Urara`s Servine. Andre noticed Pikachu and he asked Ash to have a battle with him which he agreed to. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its Pok√© ball just as the battle was about to start but Ash recalled it. Andre sent out his Futachimaru again to battle even though it has just finished battling with Urara`s Servine and even though it had a type disadvantage against Pikachu. The two of them battle intensely and despite Pikachu type advantage, Andre`s Dewott was able to hold its ground and do significant damage with its Razor Shell. The battle concluded in a draw though as Battle Club`s emergency alarm went off.",
