  "description" : "She is the daughter of the keepers of the Tatsumiya shrine (which is on campus), and works part-time there as a priestess (miko) and exorcist, employing guns with spellbreaker bullets as her tool of exorcism. She is not particularly sociable, keeping to herself most of the time and not engaging in conversation. She is a skinflint, and does not readily spend money unless she has to, or if there is a way to get a discount. She is also a mercenary, and mostly takes on contracts that pertain to hunting/destroying/exorcising demons and ghosts but will take on any job as long as she is paid well.",
