  "description" : "Noise Marie has been with the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order] for a long time. During http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda]`s memory flashback to around nine years ago, Marie was seen at the http://anidb.net/ch32500 [Asian Branch] with blood stained bandages around his eyes, having received the injury that blinded him during a mission in which the entire rest of his team was killed.\nNot long after, while on a mission, Marie sustained a serious head wound that left him in critical condition for over an hour in the field. http://anidb.net/ch32795 [Malcolm C. Lvellie] gave the order to make Marie part of the Second Exorcist Program, and Marie was taken to Laboratory 6 soon after.\nWhile unconscious in the lab, Marie was found again by http://anidb.net/ch84586 [Kanda], who accidentally healed Marie when some of his blood fell into Marie`s head wound. Kanda then took the blind Marie with him, carrying him on his back as he crawled through a ventilation duct.\nWhen Kanda found his friend, http://anidb.net/ch84587 [Alma Karma], and they began fighting, Kanda ran with Marie, but Alma lashed out at Marie and set him crashing through a wall. Both Kanda and Marie survived Alma`s slaughter of the staff of Laboratory 6, and both later became apprentices of General http://anidb.net/ch32784 [Froi Tiedoll].\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
