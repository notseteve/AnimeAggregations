  "description" : "Free`s actual name was lost during the years in Witch Jail but called himself Free as he escaped with the help of Eruka. He was placed in Witch Jail for taking Mabaa`s left eye, and above his left eye, instead of an eyebrow, it reads NOFUTURE. He has a silly personality. For example, he said he wanted to dig out of the jail using a spoon like in the movies, and started hitting his head on a tree when Eruka told him of a different yet clich√© way of escaping (although he easily could have escaped on his own through conventional means). He is from the Immortal Clan therefore he cannot die (thus granting him a soul mixed of various parts), which is why Mabaa locked him up since she could not kill him. He uses ice magic and the iron ball still locked on his leg to fight. He is also a werewolf and constantly says, \"Wolf wolves wolf wolves\" when he is on the verge of unleashing a new spell. This form of chanting is comparable to that of the witches, who also base their spells around certain, similar words and themes (Medusa`s snakes, for example).",
