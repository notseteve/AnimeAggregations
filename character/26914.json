  "description" : "Patch is the head of a small ship salvage unit working for Industria.\nHis real identity is Dr. Lao, the grandfather of Lana, the main scientist responsible for the development of solar power for both civil and wartime usage. Originally a member of the Industrian High Council, he defected after he learned of Lepka`s ambitions. He believes that the people of Industria must be taught to discard their weapons, and begin new lives. For this reason he escapes, bringing with him the secret of how to access the orbiting solar power station from pre-war times.\nSource: Wikipedia",
