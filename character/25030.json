  "description" : "The R-2 is the second unit in the R Series developed for the SRX Project. Its full name is \"Real Personal Trooper Type-2.\"\nThe R-2 specializes in heavy artillery fire, and is equipped with beam weapons as its main offense. It has the heaviest firepower of the three R units. It`s equipped with very heavy armor, which slows it down drastically, and oftenly causes it to overheat easier due to the instability of the Tronium Engine. A jet engine is equipped on its legs in order to give it a hovering ability, so it can be more maneauverable. It`s also equipped with a beam barrier.\nOn the battlefield, the R-2`s role is attack from the distance, while R-1 fights at close range, R-3 supports from the rear. The R-2 was originally supposed to be equipped with a T-Link System, just like R-1 and R-3, but it was decided that the unit would be piloted by a non-Psychodriver.\nIts right hand is equipped with a Beam Chakram, while its left has the Beam Shield. The Beam Chakram was supposed to be a Psychodriver weapon, but it was modified into a wired type weapon after the unit`s concept was changed. The Beam Chakram can be considered as the prototype for the Huckebein MK-II`s Chakram Shooter.",
