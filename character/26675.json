  "description" : "Barnaby Brooks Jr. is one of the protagonists of the series \"Tiger & Bunny\". He is also a rookie Hero, and, unlike the others, he does not keep his identity a secret. As a NEXT he possesses Hundred Power, a power that, once activated, increases his physical abilities by 100 times for five minutes. Barnaby faces his job as a Hero as just work and is intent in accumulating points. He is a good looking \"cool smart\" person who thinks before he acts. Despite coming across as cold-hearted and stoic, Barnaby does care about others; he is simply tormented by his tragic past and pushed forward by a need for revenge. Kotetsu often calls Barnaby \"Bunny\" due to the resemblance his Hero suit`s helmet adornments have to the ears of a rabbit.",
