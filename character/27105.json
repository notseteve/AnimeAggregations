  "description" : "Each elementary school has an Anti-Alien Squad (エイリアソ対策 = Alien Countermeasures) recruited from 6th grade pupils (i. e. children of age 12). Their task is to catch (not kill!) all aliens that have landed near their school. For this purpose each team member forms a symbiotic relation ship with an alien of the http://anidb.net/ch27089 [Bougu] race. Team members are equipped with in-line skates, dip net and tranquilizer guns.\nAnti-Alien Squad members have privileges at school: They`re exempt from other duties (which includes homeworks) and don`t have to attend classes when on team duty. They also don`t need to pass tests for attending a good junior high school later. However, their job brings about disadvantages such as intense mental stress for young girls.\nActually these Anti Alien Squads serve as disguise for a different project: The Bougu consider Earth as their territory which they defend against other alien races. Bougu need a permanent symbiotic fusion with humans in order to survive on Earth; the Anti Alien tasks serve as preliminary stage in order to get their host accustomed to this partnership. http://anidb.net/ch27090 [All] http://anidb.net/ch27100 [female] http://anidb.net/ch27104 [teachers] supervising these Anti Alien Squads are humans already fused with Bougu. It`s probably no coincidence that all three team members http://anidb.net/ch27091 [Yuri], http://anidb.net/ch27092 [Kumi] and http://anidb.net/ch27094 [Kasumi] have blood type AB and are on the verge of puberty - both may be requirements for the permanent fusion between both races.\n(Most of the above is explained in detail only in the manga; the anime`s OP song lyrics deal with the physical transformation and may refer to this fusion with an alien as well as to puberty.)",
