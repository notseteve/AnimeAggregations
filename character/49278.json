  "description" : "The High Speed Raiding Space Cruiser is designed as a fast attack warship for the Varauta forces. While only some 366 meters long, the Space Cruiser possesses 12 beam guns, 18 anti-ship missiles and over a dozen variable fighters granting the ship a large degree of firepower for such a small vessel. To assist in the fast attack role, the Space Cruiser has upgraded conventional engine thrust, improved maneuverability and higher fold engine power enabling the ship to arrive in a combat zone quickly, strike quickly and retreat quickly. Both armor and firepower are strongest in the forward sections of the ship; a design which aids the Space Cruiser in raids, disturbances and armed assault missions.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/varauta-highspeedraidingspacecruiser.htm",
