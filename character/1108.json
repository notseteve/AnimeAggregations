  "description" : "Starly is a Starling Pok√©mon that lives in noisy flocks with numerous members in each. It becomes less prominent when one is alone. The female`s forehead coloring is smaller than that of the male. It, and its evolutions, resemble the three bird pokemon of Pokemon Blue, Red and Green, Pidgy, Pidgeotto, and Pidgeot.\nBoth Ash and Paul catch Starly. Unlike Paul, Ash keeps his after catching it. Paul catches three of them, but releases two of them, and releases the last one at the end of the same episode. Ash`s Starly evolves into Staravia during a battle with Team Rocket.",
