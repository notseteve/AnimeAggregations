  "description" : "The protagonist of Grisaia. Ace number 9029, Yuuji is the \"janitor\" for the underworld. Tired of the life, he wanted to live a normal school life. Cool, philosophical, and minimalist, Yuuji is a realist...but also tsundere. Being very cautious, he always plans and scouts before action. Other than his occasional orthodontic military methods, he`s just a fit young man. I do question his choice of disguising as an \"exchange student from Canada\".\nSource: VNDB",
