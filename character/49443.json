  "description" : "Sousuke is one of the three children who survived the destruction of Ootsuka village 5 years prior. He did not have relatives and thus was raised with http://anidb.net/ch49442 [Shino] and http://anidb.net/ch49444 [Hamaji], the other two survivors, as if they were siblings.\nHe has a peony-shaped birthmark on the back of his neck. Ever since the accident he has an ability to transform into the dog Yoshiro, who makes up half of himself.\nHis real other half is manifested in Ao, his shadow, causing Sousuke`s memories and body parts to be split between the two. This causes Sousuke to not remember everything from his past, as well as slowly losing the ability to feel pain, and the sight in his left eye.\nHe is the holder of the Duty bead.",
