  "description" : "Pokota was born a human, but when he was an adolescent, the Durum sickness plagued Taforashia. The king, Pokota`s father, became very ill. Rezo, the Red Priest, appeared and sealed the residents of Taforashia in sleeping chambers to isolate them until a cure was found. Rezo sealed Pokota`s human body in a chamber, but he used a magical vase to transfer Pokota`s spirit into his current form, an animal-like creature about 2 feet tall.\nPokota`s primary physical characteristics are his large ears that function as his primary set of arms and hands, even though he has a smaller set of arms on his torso. He uses these ears to cast spells, make gestures, and glide through the air. His left ear has a gold ring near its four-fingered \"hand,\" resembling a bracelet. In addition to flying, Pokota can also walk or run on his two short legs.\nPokota has short, beige-colored fur, a mohawk of lavender-colored hair and green fur on the ends of his ears. Beginning at his neck and ending part-way down his torso is a zipper that he opens to remove a replica Sword of Light from inside his body. He wears a red cape.",
