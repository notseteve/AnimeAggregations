  "description" : "The Salamis-class cruiser has been the workhorse of the Earth Federation Space Force since before the start of the One Year War, and these ships have remained in service for many years thanks to periodic upgrades. The most recent round of revisions has given the venerable Salamis a mobile suit launch deck, and a hangar with enough space for three or four machines. Both the AEUG and Titan space fleets are made up primarily of these standard Salamis cruisers, with the rebel ships painted in pale green and the Titan versions retaining their original blue-grey colours.",
