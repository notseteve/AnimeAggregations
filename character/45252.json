  "description" : "Following the successful testing of Newtype pilots Elpeo Ple and Ple Two using their Qubeley Mark II mobile suits, Glemy Toto begins mass production of an improved Qubeley to be manned by his army of Ple Two clones. Called the AMX-004G Qubeley Mass Production Type, this production-line unit is introduced in January UC 0089 during the last days of the First Neo Zeon War. Although in many ways similar to the Qubeley Mark IIs, the Mass Production Type features greater firepower in two areas: a pair of \"active cannons\" on its backpack, capable of firing in a wide arc covering both the mobile suit`s front and rear; and a larger-capacity tail binder, capable of holding 30 remote funnel weapons. With a Newtype army at his command, Glemy starts his civil war against Haman; however, very determined Haman loyalists stop the Ple clones and their mass-produced Qubeleys, resulting in an almost complete mutual annihilation of both Neo Zeon factions. Early production models are painted gray, but the final production models are rolled out in a black paint scheme similar to the Qubeley Mark II. At least one mass production Qubeley, possibly the unit piloted by Ple Twelve, falls into the hands of the mysterious Vist Foundation by UC 0096.\nSource: mahq.net",
