  "description" : "A cheerful, rather childish schoolgirl who attends the same school as Tsubasa. Two years ago while attending a ZweiWing concert, she was nearly killed by the Noise, barely surviving thanks to the sacrifice of Kanade, who taught her never to accept death. During the first episode, when she becomes cornered by the Noise, she sings the same song she heard Kanade sing and ended up gaining Symphogear powers due a fragment of Kanade`s armor that entered her body that day. Her first name means \"Echo\", while her family name means \"Standing flower\".\nSource: Wiki",
