  "description" : "Sango is a demon slayer who hails from a village of professional demon slayers. Naraku wipes out her entire family and village, then causes Sango to blame InuYasha and try to kill him. When the plot fails, Naraku revives Sango`s little brother Kohaku, controlling him as a pawn to manipulate Sango`s emotions and attack the rest of InuYasha`s group. Sango seeks vengeance against Naraku, but her primary goal is to rescue Kohaku from Naraku`s influence and save his life.\nOf her broad repertoire of tools and tricks for fighting demons, her most powerful weapon is the Hiraikotsu, a massive boomerang made of purified demon bones. She is accompanied by the demon cat Kirara. Sango is often the victim of Miroku`s lecherous tendencies and slaps him for it.\nShe has three kids with Miroku by the end of the series, twin girls and a boy.",
