  "description" : "As a child, everyone in Oboro`s home except for him got killed by the members of http://anidb.net/ch87781 [Tenshouin Naraku]. Even though he hid himself, assassins eventually found him and severely wounded him and set his home on fire. At the brink of death, he was saved by http://anidb.net/ch12459 [Yoshida Shouyou], who was part of the Naraku at that time, so that he could survive and hate \"him\" for as long as \"he\" would live.\nAfter that, Oboro remained at Shouyou`s place and helped him with house chores, since he wanted to serve the man who gave him a reason to live.",
