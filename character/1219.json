  "description" : "Skuntank is the evolved form of Stunky. It resembles a large hog-nosed skunk with a bushy and voluminous striped tail that covers part of its face. Its entire body is covered in dark purple fur, except for the areas around its snout and paws, which are beige in color. Skuntank has the ability to shoot a foul-smelling secretion from the tip of its tail up to about 160 feet away. Skuntank is exclusive to Pokémon Diamond, and its natural moveset is identical to its pre-evolution, Stunky`s, except for the addition of the move Flamethrower. Galactic Commander Jupiter uses a Skuntank. Jupiter and her skuntank appear in DP096 & DP097 along with Mars, Saturn, and Cyrus.\nIn Pokémon Mystery Dungeon 2, Skuntank is the evil leader of Team Skull, with his underlings Koffing and Zubat. He and his cronies stop the player and his partner from getting to food underneath a tree, and engage them in combat.",
