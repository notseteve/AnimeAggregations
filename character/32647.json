  "description" : "Kuyo is the head of the PSC who enforces the group`s rules with a tyrannical and sadistic iron fist, going so far to state if someone goes against him, they are against the school. He is a youko (a fox demon) bearing four tails and has many fire-based abilities, including the abililty to take on a hybrid form, and has attacks such as the \"Vortex of Flame\" and the \"Flame Wheel of Doom\". In the anime, he believes youkai and humans will always remain enemies, claiming friendship between the two only occurs in fairy tales. Although he was easily able to overpower the Newspaper Club with his flame-based powers, he was swiftly defeated by Tsukune after the latter was injected with Moka`s blood.\nSource: wiki",
