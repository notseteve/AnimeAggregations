  "description" : "Purrloin, known as the Devious Pokémon, is a purple feline Pokémon. It plays with and steals people`s belongings. Even the people it steals from unconsciously forgive it due to its charming behavior. Its adorable behavior causes people to let down their guard, and it takes that opportunity to steal their belongings. If it gets mad it will fight back with its claws.\nGamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson noted it and its evolution as a decent Dark-type pair, though the stats are somewhat low.",
