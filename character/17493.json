  "description" : "Nurarihyon is Rikuo`s grandfather, known as the master of all spirits or as the Supreme Commander. It is said that he plays pranks and hates humans, but he doesn`t really hate them - rather, he doesn`t believe humans should interfere in youkai affairs. He dislikes the fact that Rikuo goes to school and acts human but respects his wishes.\n400 years ago, he fell in love with Youhime and fought with the Hagoromo-Gitsune in Kyoto. He won and became the master of all spirits but at the cost of shortening his life span greatly. In his prime, he and Keikan Hidemoto were considered friends. Even in his old age, he can easily best \"Night\" Rikuo and Muchi. Normal demons feel so much \"Fear\" that he is invisible to them until he strikes, that is his \"Meikyou Shisui\".",
