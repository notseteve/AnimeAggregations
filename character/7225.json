  "description" : "Hanamichi Sakuragi is the protagonist of Slam Dunk. At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, good for nothing other than fighting (he was on the brink of getting identified by those around him as a delinquent). He is the leader of the feared \"Sakuragi Legion\", which consists of his four friends Mito, Noma, Ohkusu and Takamiya.\nSakuragi`s quest for love was nothing but humiliating. He was always trying to ask girls out, but was rejected constantly, the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series. He then met Haruko Akagi, a lovely basketball fangirl, whom he fell in love with immediately. This and Haruko`s encouragement led to him to join the Shohoku basketball team.",
