  "description" : "Sui is Kei`s younger brother and resembles a younger version of Kei. Initially, he dislikes Kei because he finds living with him disgusting and thinks of him as a robot wearing human skin. Because Sui feels very inferior to his brother, who is good at everything, he believes that he cannot reach Kei`s level and he refuses to take his studies seriously. However, when he sees that even his \"perfect\" brother can become desperate and caring, Sui develops a huge brother complex. Sui likes to call Hikari \"Stupid Girl\", but approaches her frequently when he thinks that Kei needs help. He is in grade 6, class B at Hakusen Academy elementary school division.",
