He first appears in episode \"The Mysterious Boy, Yaboshi Seiya\" and after touching Miyu`s hand had read her mind and wanted to take Ruu with him to planet Sharaku, his home planet to appear on a television program because people from planet Otto were rare, but after reading Miyu`s hand, he understood that Ruu was precious to her and Kanata and stopped his pursuit of him. He has a sister, Rui, who saved him once from being sucked into a worm hole, and has had a sheltered childhood. His surname, Yaboshi, means night star.",
