  "description" : "Igneous is the third of Raindevila`s primary henchmen to appear in the story. He is a fire demon from the tribe of Hima. He is a sneaky and manipulative demon who doesn`t like to get his hands dirty and usually has his minions fight for him before he goes in for the kill. He makes a pact with Takurou and takes residence in his heart and controls his body. He starts to like peace and quiet and actually sees Takuro as a friend, though he doesn`t admit saying he is a member of the fire demon tribe. He is later killed by Potamos. Before he dies he goes to Takuro and releases him from his contract. He then tells Takuro that he actually started to become fond of him. As he passes he looks at the moon and admits that it is beautiful.",
