  "description" : "Sheska is a mousy, bespectacled young woman who had previously worked in the National Central Library in Central City, but was fired for spending her time reading books instead of doing her job. http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric seek her out to discover whether or not http://anidb.net/ch10165 [Tim Marcoh]`s research journal had been located in the library`s First Branch, which had been burnt down. After finding her trapped in her home under a collapsed mountain of books, Sheska confirms the Elrics` worst fears - that the book, which she herself had read cover to cover, had indeed been in the First Branch and, therefore, destroyed.\nBut, as they leave, visibly disheartened, Sheska reveals that she has a photographic memory and can recreate the book for them, exactly as it had looked when she read it. As a result, Sheska is able to recreate Marcoh`s notes in five days to such a degree of detail that, even though Marcoh wrote them in code, Edward is able to decipher their hidden truth.\nWhen http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes] reveals that several court-martial records had been kept in the First Branch, Edward and Alphonse recommend Sheska for the task of recreating them, as she had read them as well. Thanks to this, Sheska is hired into the Amestrian military at a desk job in the records department.",
