  "description" : "After Ash`s Tranquill replaced Pikachu in the final match-up in the gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was overpowered by Skyla`s Swanna`s Hurricane and was knocked down hard to the ground. Ash`s Unfezant then evolved from Ash`s Tranquill and proved it was stronger and faster than Skyla`s Swanna.\nGym Battle against Skyla`s Swanna\nAsh dex and Cilan both noted that Ash`s Unfezant was female so it should be able to match or even surpass Swanna`s flying abilities. It also learned the new move Aerial Ace. After a short battle based on speed and air maneuvers, Ash`s Unfezant used its new move Aerial Ace and managed to catchup and hit Skyla`s Swanna in the air. The direct hit proved to be too much for it it and Skyla`s Swanna was knocked out and Ash ended up the overall victor of the gym battle. Ash`s Unfezant proved that it evolving brought in an unexpected element that Skyla could never have predicted in her air battle simulations.",
