  "description" : "The Einstein Research Experimental Ships (ship class unknown) are built for the United Scientific Consortium to conduct various types of research. While used primarily for astrophysics, gravitational engineering and space biology, the Einstein has come to be utilized for all types of research and even prototype product development. The extensive scientific facilities and analytical capabilities of the Einstein makes the ship ideal for exploration and an indispensable part of any fleet traveling through uncharted areas of space.\nIn December of 2045, the Einstein became very active after the discovery of Protoculture Ruins on the planet Rax. The extensive facilities aided the UN Forces as they examined all information gathered from the Protoculture temple. Advisor Exedol was a key figure in researching data gathered about the Protoculture and the Protoculture connection to the Protodeviln. All this research was conducted on the research ship and Exedol remained aboard the Einstein up until the end of the Protodeviln War in 2046.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/einstein.htm",
