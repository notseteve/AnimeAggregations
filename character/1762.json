  "description" : "Iserlohn Fortress was an Imperial fortress located near the Tiamat Starzone. Existing within the eponymously named Iserlohn Corridor, one of only two navigable star routes between the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Empire] and the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance] (the other being the http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan] Corridor), Iserlohn kept the territories of the Galactic Empire safe from Alliance invasion.\nThe fortress had a diameter of 60 kilometres and a mass of nearly 60 trillion tonnes. Its primary weapon was an enormous X-ray beam cannon, the Thor Hammer, which was capable of destroying large numbers of enemy vessels in a single shot. Its docks could berth 20,000 ships, and its dedicated agriculture blocks could sustain both a garrison of up to 2 million and a civilian population of up to 3 million indefinitely. The fortress exterior was a several-layer-thick coating of liquid hydro-metal, which absorbed solid projectiles and reflected directed energy; hundreds of cannon turrets floated in this liquid and would rise to fire at approaching enemies.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
