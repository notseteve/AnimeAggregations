  "description" : "Kanda Yuu is an Exorcist and member of the http://anidb.net/ch32499 [European Branch] of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order], formerly of the http://anidb.net/ch32500 [Asian Branch].\nHe is a Second Exorcist, an Exorcist raised in a test tube and artificially modified to bear the Innocence of the previous Exorcist his brain formerly belonged to. He is also the second incarnation of the http://anidb.net/ch84613 [lover] of fellow Second Exorcist http://anidb.net/ch81263 [Alma Karma]`s http://anidb.net/ch84614 [former incarnation].\nMugen, his Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, is a sword with supernatural powers. The shape of the sword has changed throughout the story: during his childhood, it takes the form of a small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt; upon Kanda`s introduction in the beginning of the series, it took the form of a chokuto with a black cross-emblazoned hilt and sheath; after his battle with http://anidb.net/ch9411 [Skin Boric], it was reforged into a traditional http://anidb.net/t1640 [katana].\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
