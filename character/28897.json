  "description" : "Mihashi Ruri is the cousin of Mihashi Ren. When they were young, Ren and his family visited Ruri and they often played together with Kanou, leading him and Ren to develop a friendship. During his middle school games, he told Ruri to not attend and thus did not tell her when the games took place, embarrassed and ashamed for his failures. She cheered for Nishiura during their game against Tosei, surprised by how Ren had skillfully played during the game. Ruri enjoys calling Ren by the nickname Renren, much to his dismay. Rens teammates even teased him upon hearing Ruri call him by that nickname. She has a younger brother named Ryuu.",
