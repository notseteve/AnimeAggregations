  "description" : "Alberto is the baron of Álamos Town. Like Tonio, he has had a crush on Alice for a long time. Unlike Tonio, he makes his feeling well known to Alice but she keeps turning down his advances by telling him that she likes Tonio.\nHe was transformed into Lickilicky during the God`s battle. His Beroberto was having a dream where it became the baron and that dream became a reality. Alberto`s name is a pun on the Japanese name of his Pokémon Beroberto (ベロベルト). He gained the nickname Baron Beroberto due to this incident. In the Portugese dub, he was renamed so this pun could be kept.",
