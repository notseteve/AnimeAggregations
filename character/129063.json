He is also the younger twin brother of Haruka Nijo, as well as the bassist of the band εpsilonΦ.\nThe popular guy that everyone adores, who is always friendly and cheerful—all of which he does to ensure Haruka Nijo has zero semblance of any interpersonal relationship and smash his hope to pieces. Nothing makes him happier than seeing his brother tormented by loneliness and the moments he`d glare at him with vengeful eyes full of hatred. To ensure his brother thinks of no one else but himself, he follows him everywhere he goes, but at the root of it all lies a deep love for his brother.",
