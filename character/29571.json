  "description" : "A bright, handsome and popular guy. Enrolled in Assault, and in the same class as Kinji. His Butei level is A. Even though there are different aspects involved in an A ranking, his integration capacity is high. Barehanded, dagger handling or shooting aspects can all be relied on. The reliability of his gun is very high, a Mk. 23 MODO with an installed laser aiming lens. He is also a rare polite person in Butei High. Even though he is very popular with girls, he never had a girlfriend before.\nHe is Kinji and Mutou`s close friend. In past, back in Kinji`s Assault days, he was often his teammate. Kinji considers him a good friend and someone to rely on, an example of a polite and elegant student.\nSource: Wiki",
