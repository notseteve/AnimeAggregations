  "description" : "As the First Neo Zeon War rages on, the Neo Zeon military continues its development of new and more powerful mobile suits. Two competing designs are produced as potential new mass production frontline units: the AMX-011 Zaku III and the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf. The intention of the Zaku III`s design is to be a new descendant of the old Principality of Zeon`s venerable (and highly versatile) MS-05 Zaku I and MS-06 Zaku II lines. The Zaku III features a modular construction design, enabling armor, the backpack, and other components to be changed out and customized pursuant to the current mission role. Despite its high performance and versatility, however, the Zaku III design loses out to the more contemporary Dooben-Wolf. As a result, the Zaku III sees only limited production, with a handful of prototypes often operated by high-ranking officers or ace pilots.\nSource: mahq.net",
