  "description" : "Zinv`s opposite, Himiko carved a swath of ruin across D`s world before she escaped. It seems as though only people with negative emotions in their hearts can control Himiko, as evidenced by its initial rejection of Mitsuki Rara, and its violent reaction to Mitsuki Sanada`s jealousy. Himiko has some connection to the alien lifeform Kumu.\nHimiko is completely and totally destroyed at the hands of Zinv, compressed down to nothing to prevent it from regenerating.",
