  "description" : "Clay`s Excadrill was Clay`s third and final Pokémon that battle against Ash during his gym battle. Ash kept his Snivy out to battle against Clay`s Excadrill but that matchup didn`t last long as Clay`s Excadrill was able to defend against all of Ash`s Snivy`s attacks. Ash`s Snivy was quickly knocked out with a strong Horn Drill.\nBattle Against Ash`s Roggenrola/Boldore\nAsh realized that only one of his Pokémon would be able to endure the attacks from Clay`s Excadrill and keep enduring them until there was a chance to counterattack and that was Ash`s Roggenrola. Ash`s Roggenrola kept on enduring all the attacks for quite awhile until it evolved into Ash`s Boldore. After evolving it learned two new moves and it became even stronger than when it was a Roggenrola. The battle then turned into a frontal power match between two Pokémon with strong bodies and Ash`s Roggenrola was able to counterattack against Clay`s Excadrill. Clay`s Excadrill was unable to match the power of Ash`s Roggenrola`s Rock Smash and Clay`s Excadrill was knocked out giving Ash the overall victory in the gym battle.",
