  "description" : "Touchuumaru is Shigure`s pet mouse. He is used mostly for comic relief, such as causing Apachai to be blamed for its stealing a lunch Miu made. Toochuumaru is shown to be extraordinarily strong for a mouse, beating one of Boris`s men with nunchaku and, in an omake, beating a cat with its tail. While referred to as male, it is always seen with a feminine bow on its tail. Similar to other residents of the dojo, it seems to be knowledgeable of martial arts.",
