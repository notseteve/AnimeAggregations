  "description" : "He is a silent, largely built man with a small mohawk shaped like a lightning bolt. He wears a light undergarment under his Soul Reaper uniform, as well as a pair of sunglasses. From the opening credits, it would seem that he has superhuman strength. Like Kenryuu, he is a servant of Rurichiyo Kasumiouji. He takes the responsibility of punishing anyone he believes to be being rude to their princess. He has a very high-pitched and squeaky voice, which he is embarrassed about, but Rurichiyo likes.",
