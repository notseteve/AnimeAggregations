  "description" : "Louden`s Clauncher is Louden`s main partner. Udeppou is not very friendly. Louden originally planned to have it entertain the guests at the aquarium but Louden`s Clauncher seems to hate being watched by people. It lost its appetite and in the twinkling of an eye, became lethargic, so Louden decided to made it his Pokémon.\nWhen Rocket Gang tried to steal Clemont`s Dedenne, it fought to save it. It may not be a friendly Pokémon, but it has a strong sense of justice.",
