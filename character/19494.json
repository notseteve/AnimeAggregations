  "description" : "Sugiura (exact name unknown) is an inhabitant of the shadow town under the full moon. A dubious man of uncertain age (who calls himself a romancer and heavy drinker and is not above groping http://anidb.net/ch19484 [busty women] on occasion). But when it comes to protecting helpless people against monsters he has a heart of gold, shows no signs of fear and skillfully uses his rifle to shoot down zombies and shapeless black beings.\nThese ghost-like beings named \"minions\" are manifestations of an \"open seam\" in the virtual world of the http://anidb.net/ch39798 [Pandora Project] through which \"the laws of physics of a crumbled reality intruded into this world\". By shooting down as many minions as possible Sugiura (being in the know about the project) tries to delay the inevitable destruction of this world as long as possible.",
