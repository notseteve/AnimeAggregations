  "description" : "Kellyn is a Pokémon Ranger from the Fiore region but transferred to Almia when he was 10. From there, he went to the Almia ranger school.\nKellyn rarely likes to work with people and will only if he sees a connection between the person and the Pokémon he is saving or if he is forced to. Being known as the \"Genius Ranger\", he can operate as an operator, ranger and mechanic. He is a bit of a neat freak when it comes to his collection of items at home. His memory is vivid and strong, as he can recite all of Almia`s times in order.\nWhen in Sinnoh, he and Solana were to find the a lost Riolu from the Lucario Kingdom. Kellyn went to find him, while Solana and Officer Jenny looked for Pokémon Hunter J. At first, Kellyn thought that having Ash and company would ruin the mission but after he saw their intentions, he let them travel with him. When Riolu was safely home, Kellyn supposedly went to the Hoenn region to work full time in stopping Kyogre and Groudon`s fighting from reoccurring.",
