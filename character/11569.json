  "description" : "Amakawa Yuuto is the only living descendant of the Amakawa Clan, one of 12 ancient demon-slayer families. Yuuto`s parents died in a car accident when he was young, causing him to fall into a state of depression. It was only through the care and help of his childhood friend, Rinko, that brought him out of his depression. All his life, Yuuto possessed a charm that was said to ward off evil spirits, but that the charm would stop working on his 16th birthday. On the day of his 16th birthday, Yuuto meets Himari, a katana-wielding girl at his school. Himari is actually a cat spirit and descendant of a clan of spirit that have served the Amakawa for many generations, and it is her duty to now protect Yuuto. This is complicated however by the fact that Yuuto has an allergy to cats that cause his eyes to water and his nose to run. Yuuto`s life becomes more complicated when he discovers that he can wield the Light Ferry, the Amakawa Clan`s ancient demon-slaying power that is both feared by demons and spirits and coveted by members of the other demon-slaying families. Initially unable to wield this great power voluntarily, Yuuto has since learned to exert some minor control over his power.",
