She is very much infatuated with http://anidb.net/ch18060 [Bunmei], and develops a hatred for http://anidb.net/ch18059 [Mikaze] because of that. Despite numerous attempts, she was never successful in courting http://anidb.net/ch18060 [Bunmei].\nInitially, Chihiro is hinted to be an antagonist, but she is eventually revealed to be a white mage, whose goal was to keep http://anidb.net/ch18062 [Maya] safe under http://anidb.net/ch19562 [Jun`ichirou]`s request.
