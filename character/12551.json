She is ageless and her way of speaking is poetic (Tanka Poetry), or rather archaic.\nAt times when Ruriko or Shun are troubled, she appears as a vision and helps them. Her only friend is Hisame, a white creature, although she also makes friends with Saemi.\nLike her name Yukino suggests, she commands the Gate of Ice and Snow, being able to summon blizzards and hail. She is one of the most powerful Gate Keepers in the series, being referred to as a `top-secret, High-Level Gate Keeper.",
