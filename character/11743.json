  "description" : "A student at Holy Land Academy who is in the same class as Kenshi. He is also a Seikishi like Kenshi, but unlike most Seikishi who are born in nobility, he was born into a common family, which is highly unlikely for him. He is in love with a young girl named Hazuki, but because of his Seikishi status, he cannot be seen with her as male Seikishi are forbidden to have relationships with commoners.\nSource: Wiki",
