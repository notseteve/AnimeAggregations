  "description" : "Ash`s Pokabu was first seen by Don George at his Battle Club when it original trainer came to battle. Pokabu lost to a Shikijika during the battle and its trainer tied it to a pole and left it. The Pokabu ended up getting the string tied around its snout making it impossible for it to eat.\nAsh saw Pokabu on the security camera video and thought it was an Umbreon because it was all dirty. When Ash finally spotted Pokabu, he cornered it in an alley and tried to be friendly with it. Ash noticed the rope tied around its snout and loosened it. Pokabu then helped rescue Pikachu from Team Rocket.\nIris wanted to get Pokabu but it wanted to be caught by Ash instead. Realizing that Pokabu wanted to travel with him, Ash captured Pokabu just outside the Battle Club in Karakusa Town.",
