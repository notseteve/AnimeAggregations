  "description" : "Hailing from a rural community in the Martian countryside, Nono is a simple and clumsy girl with a big dream: she wants to be a space pilot. And not just any space pilot, but one to rival \"Nonoriri\". Of course, dreaming of being a pilot and actually becoming one are two entirely different things, as she soon finds out upon reaching the city. Even after landing a somewhat dead-end job as a waitress in one of the city`s bars, Nono stubbornly holds on to her ideals, despite the chiding of her boss and the bar`s regular patrons. Her persistence pays off, however, when she encounters a real space pilot in the person of Lal`C Melk Mark, member of the elite Fraternity and current pilot of Buster Machine Dix-Neuf. It is through Lal`C (whom she impulsively dubs her onee-sama, or big sister) that Nono finally finds the means to make her dreams a reality.\nPossessing a bubbly personality and a near-endless supply of optimism, Nono seems to be a normal, if clumsy, country girl. However, Nono is anything but normal; in fact, she isn`t even human, but an android, who can`t quite remember the reason why she was built (though much of her past is revealed later in the series). She idolizes Lal`C, despite the fact that the latter seems to regard her with mild annoyance, and will do anything to please her.\nNono has trace recorded history of http://anidb.net/ch1836 [Takaya Noriko] and http://anidb.net/ch1837 [Amano Kazumi] (The pilots of Buster Machines 1 and 2) in her memory. The very person she Idolizes and wants to become is Takaya Noriko. Due to her damaged memory, Nono cannot remember Noriko`s actual name and thus pronounces it Nonoriri.",
