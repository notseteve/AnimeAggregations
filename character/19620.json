When they finally get to the Kame House, http://anidb.net/ch11416 [Piccolo] tells them Gokuu is not there and refuses to tell them where he went. Piccolo then challenges him to a battle and as they fight, Piccolo`s ki leads http://anidb.net/ch20915 [Cell] (who needs to absorb both jinzouningen to reach its perfect form) to the battlefield. Cell tells Jinzouningen 17 Gou to surrender so he can become a part of \"greatness\". He refuses and is then defeated during the ensuing battle.\nAfter Cell is defeated, http://anidb.net/ch11414 [Kuririn] uses the Dragon Balls to wish for him and his sister to be turned into humans; http://anidb.net/ch7015 [Shenron] is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed.",
