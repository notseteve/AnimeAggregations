He is a mass murderer in http://anidb.net/ch13302 [Future Trunks]` timeline.\nOriginally a human, he and his sister were modified into cyborgs by http://anidb.net/ch18381 [Dr. Gero].\nOn a Q&A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published May 2nd, 2014 it was revealed that his human name was Lapis.\nDuring the events of the Jinzouningen & Cell arc, he and his sister drive around in a van with http://anidb.net/ch19618 [Jinzouningen 16 Gou], looking for http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Gokuu]. When they finally get to the Kame House, http://anidb.net/ch11416 [Piccolo] tells them Gokuu is not there and refuses to tell them where he went. Piccolo then challenges him to a battle and as they fight, Piccolo`s ki leads http://anidb.net/ch20915 [Cell] (who needs to absorb both jinzouningen to reach its perfect form) to the battlefield. Cell tells Jinzouningen 17 Gou to surrender so he can become a part of \"greatness\". He refuses and is then defeated during the ensuing battle.\nAfter Cell is defeated, http://anidb.net/ch11414 [Kuririn] uses the Dragon Balls to wish for him and his sister to be turned into humans; http://anidb.net/ch7015 [Shenron] is unable to perform this task because of the unfathomable differences in power between him and the duo, so he wishes instead for their self destruct devices to be removed.",
