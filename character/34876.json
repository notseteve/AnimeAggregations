  "description" : "A young boy with the title of `Edison`, who is often inventing various robotics. He is often more fascinated by mathematics as opposed to puzzles, though takes interest in Kaito after witnessing his Phi-Brain in action. At first, he appeared to be self-centered, however this resulted from him being too young to understand the full extent of some of his actions. Nonoha calls him \"Q-kun\", as a pun on his name, and he does not seem to have a problem with that.\nSource: Wiki",
