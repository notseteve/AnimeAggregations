  "description" : "The captain of the assault carrier Albion is a grizzled veteran, with a commanding personality and a keen tactical mind. Originally dispatched to collect the prototype Gundams from the Federation`s Torrington base, Synapse soon finds himself charged with pursuing the stolen Gundam GP02A. Well aware that he can expect little guidance or support from the Federation`s upper ranks, Synapse is often forced to rely on his own judgement... and his own sense of right and wrong.",
