A replacement member of Robert`s Ten. Utilises his limiting condition, as when he revert his eyes to normal size, the sugar turns back into electricity which can make for a devastating attack.\nAlso, Yunpao uses strange poses to distract his enemies from his large eyes and appears to be quite acrobatic as well. Loves sweets. Ueki retires him with a Pick. Yunpao seems unsuited to being in Robert`s Ten, seemingly possessing no evil. He does, however, become very annoyed when he is interrupted while eating.",
