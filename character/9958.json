  "description" : "Kunisaki Shugo is a player who wins a special chibi version of Kite`s avatar in a contest developed by Aura. He originally believes himself to have outgrown video games, but after winning the character along with his twin sister, Rena, who won a version of BlackRose`s avatar, the two join the game. He lacks planning skills and is incapable of turning down the requests of others. He is given a version of Kite`s Twilight Bracelet by Aura that does not harm humans. Aura`s plan is to motivate Shugo by allowing him to be a hero, after meeting and talking to him using another player`s character in the past.",
