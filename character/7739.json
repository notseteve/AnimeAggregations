  "description" : "Kakuzu is the partner of http://anidb.net/ch7740 [Hidan] and a former ninja of http://anidb.net/ch12203 [Takigakure], the Village Hidden in a Waterfall. Kakuzu is motivated by greed and joins the http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki] to seek out valuable bounties. However, his extreme temperament led Kakuzu to dislike having a partner and eventually killing whoever he is partnered with in a fit of rage, being paired up with the immortal Hidan as a result. Kakuzu`s body is composed of large amounts of black threads, allowing him to reattach any bodypart, his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents for his personal use while executing a forbidden Jutsu called Jiongu (地怨虞?) to integrate their hearts into his body to cheat death and extend his life indefinitely. Claiming to have lived since the time of Hashirama Senju, Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back. The masks can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and can quickly be recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart. Kakuzu`s hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konohagakure] ninja. After http://anidb.net/ch226 [Uzumaki Naruto] leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by http://anidb.net/ch7248 [Kakashi].",
