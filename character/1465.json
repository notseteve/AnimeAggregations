  "description" : "Xia Yu Lan is a 16-year-old girl who belongs to Amalgam. The younger of the Xia sisters. Her skill as an assassin is the best of the best. She excels at hand-to-hand combat. The way she moves efficiently and expressionlessly kills and injures people with indifference conjures images of a killing machine. Yu Lan claims that she \"never feels fear\". The only people she trusts are her one and only blood relative - Yu Fan, her elder twin, and the person the twins call \"Sensei\". Incidentally, it seems that deep down, she hates Gates quite a bit.",
