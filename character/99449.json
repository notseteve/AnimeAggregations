  "description" : "Oggai are a new form of one-eyed ghoul.\nThey are stated to be made differently from the http://anidb.net/ch98963 [Quinx Squad] in a new and innovative process. They were created under the authority of newly-appointed bureau director http://anidb.net/ch95703 [Washuu Kichimura] using http://anidb.net/ch68389 [Kanou Akihiro]`s perfected kakuhou transplant surgery.\nThey were deployed against http://anidb.net/ch99076 [Kaneki Ken] and all inhabitants of the 24th Ward to exterminate the organization known as http://anidb.net/ch99077 [Goat] during the Goat Wipeout Operation. Despite killing many, including http://anidb.net/ch95747 [Arima Squad] members http://anidb.net/ch99447 [Ihei Shio] and http://anidb.net/ch99448 [Souzu Rikai], they were all devoured by the crippled Kaneki after his regenerative powers kicked in. The RC cell overload from the Oggais` bodies caused Kaneki to mutate into his dragon form.\nSource: Tokyo Ghoul Wiki",
