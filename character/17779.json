  "description" : "Igou Hisashi is Rei`s classmate and boyfriend. He, Takashi, and Rei were among the first to try and escape the rampage at the school. On their way out of class, he was bitten by an infected teacher and subsequently turned into one of \"them\" afterwards. Aware of his fate, he instructed Takashi to kill him before he turned, but died before Takashi could do so, and rose back up as one of \"them\". Takashi then gathers himself together and takes down Hisashi permanently. A brief bitterness between Rei and Takashi occurred as a result from his death. Hisashi was responsible for \"naming\" the zombies as \"them\".\nSource: Wiki",
