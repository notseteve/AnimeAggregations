  "description" : "The Sixth Neck, she is a small, squeaky-voiced catgirl who is often seen wearing a nurse`s outfit and wielding a giant syringe. She appears to fit the stereotypical, cheerful catgirl archetype, but it is later revealed that she was the subject and victim of horrible medical experiments, which is most likely what made her an Orochi follower. Nekoko`s syringe contains some form of medication that can heal injuries and sickness, but the injection causes horrible pain, as noted by Girochi. Alternatively, Nekoko can launch the syringe like a rocket, carrying the same kind of kinetic charge displayed by Tsubasa`s knives, Corona`s lipsticks and Reiko`s fountain pens.\nHer mech, Izuhara no Tamazuchi, nicknamed Meow Meow (Nya Nya), is a large mechanical ball with many cannons on it that is capable of destroying buildings easily.\nThere is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her bottom.",
