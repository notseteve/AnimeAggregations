  "description" : "The captain of the legendary White Base is now the commander of the Earth Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce, and the captain of its flagship Ra Cailum. In the years following the One Year War, Bright married former White Base navigator Mirai Yashima, and was then drawn into new conflicts against the Federation`s evil Titans faction and resurgent Zeon forces. Years of battling tyrants and rebels have made Bright perhaps the Federation`s finest tactician and its most charismatic commander, but the demands of his career leave him little chance to visit his family back on Earth. Even when Hathaway arrives aboard the Ra Cailum, Bright has no time to spare for his son, leaving the lad in the care of Amuro and his other underlings.\nSource: Official Site",
