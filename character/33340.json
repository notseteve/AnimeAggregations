  "description" : "Hajiki is the main protagonist of Gad Guard and is a short-tempered and somewhat jaded boy. Being the eldest child and only son of the Sanada family, Hajiki works as a delivery boy in Unit Blue for Mr. Hachisuka of Hachisuka Express. A bit of a degenerate and a punk at first, Hajiki skips school, races the cops on his skateboard or moped, and hangs out at all hours with his similarly punkish friends for lack of anything better to do. His mother was widowed when his father, an astronaut, died in a freak accident concerning the launching of a ship into outer space. Now the man of the house, Hajiki works himself to the bone, losing sleep and even putting himself in danger to help his mother and his sister Satsuki survive.\nThe main events in the series center around Hajiki`s rivalry with Katana and the relationships he shares with the other Techode owners. After running into the justice-crazed Takumi, the friendly Aiko and the danger-prone Arashi the group forms a friendship over the course of the series. Their relationships vary from episode to episode, as Hajiki sees Takumi as overly-righteous, thinks Aiko`s a little too obsessed with mutual friendship, and can`t seem to figure out what to do with Arashi. Still, he seems to hold all four of the others close, even Katana, and like Aiko, he wishes they were all on the same side.\n`Hajiki` is Japanese slang for `gun`, an object that is by nature quick, forceful and erratic. A gun is also commonly considered the weapon opposite of a sword which is by definition a sharp, precise and brutally personal weapon, qualities relatable to Katana.\nSource: wiki",
