  "description" : "Duclis was a friend of the royal family of Taforashia. When the Durum sickness struck the kingdom, Duclis and Taforashia`s prince, Pokota, tried to heal the residents, but the illness was too fast. Rezo, the Red Priest, appeared and put the kingdom`s residents to sleep until a cure could be found. Rezo transferred the spirits of Duclis and Pokota into their current animal-like forms so they could try to find a cure without being affected by the disease.\nSource: kanzaka.wikia.com",
