  "description" : "She is a cooperator of Pretty Cure that appears in Yes! PreCure 5! GoGo! Her civilian name backwards has the same pronunciation with Miruku no Mimi meaning \"Milk`s ears.\" She has long, violet, curly hair and fuchsia eyes. When transformed, she wears violet with blue flower decorations. A calm, smart character, her cool persona acts as a mask to her bizarre personality.\nShe introduces herself as \"The Blue Rose is The Secret Mark, Milky Rose!\" (Aoi Bara ha Himitsu no Shirushi, Milky Rose!)\nShe is actually Milk in human form, who got her powers from a blue colored seed left behind after the events of episode 7. Milk/Kurumi can`t stay in this form for too long, as it drains her energy and reverts her back to mascot form.",
