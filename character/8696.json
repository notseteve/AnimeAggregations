  "description" : "The enigmatic \"prince\" from http://anidb.net/ch6847 [Utena]`s childhood. Dios` name, which means \"Godlike\" in Greek, as well as his presentation in the anime, suggest that he is to be considered Utena`s guardian angel. During most of the duels, it is shown that his spirit enters Utena`s body and aids her. This is an indication that Dios may have been a skilled swordsman before his imprisonment.\nDespite his limited screen time, Dios is a central figure in the anime and is at the centre of the plot. Dios was created when http://anidb.net/ch6889 [Anthy] imprisoned the Prince, splitting him into two parts (the other of which is http://anidb.net/ch8697 [Akio]). However, it is not known whether it was a physical separation or if Dios exists only as a spirit.\nDuring the anime, Dios is seen repeatedly providing assistance to Utena; whether this is part of Akio`s plans or Dios` own will is uncertain.",
