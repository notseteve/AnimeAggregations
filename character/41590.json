  "description" : "Larva is a Western shinma. His weapons are sharp claws. Although he came to Japan as Miyu`s enemy, Miyu sucked his blood, forming a bond between these two, and (OVA only) depriving Larva of words and face as punishment: He covers his body with black cloaks, including a face mask. Thus Larva has become Miyu`s faithful servant, reluctantly at first but later pledges to be by Miyu`s side because of her sorrow, something he was able to glimpse at during both blood-bond scenes.\nSource: wiki",
