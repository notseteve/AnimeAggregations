  "description" : "A self-proclaimed ghost hunter with a crush on Panty. He is more commonly known as Brief, and normally called \"Geek Boy\" by Panty and Stocking. He carries a backpack-like device capable of detecting Ghosts or blowing out a smokescreen, and often acts as the voice of reason when the angels are working. Brief tends to be the butt of a lot of jokes as he is constantly knocked around and subjected to various forms of abuse, particularly by the Anarchy sisters themselves. In addition, Brief is continually harassed by Garterbelt`s sexual advances. A running gag in the series sees Brief falling headfirst into a pile of garbage. His hair constantly obscures his eyes, but it doesn`t appear to impair his vision, and when pulled back reveals an incredibly handsome face. He possesses Hell`s Monkey, a mystical key disguised as his penis, which has the power to unleash chaos upon the world and reveals its true form once Brief attempts to have sex with Panty.",
