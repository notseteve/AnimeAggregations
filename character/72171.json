  "description" : "Lindsay and her husband Eddie are marine archaeology. They were scheduled to explore the Muraille Coast area of the ocean near Kojin Town when they encountered Ash Ketchum and his Badly Poisoned Pikachu. After healing Pikachu with an Antidote, they explained that they were planning to dive in that area of the ocean today to see if they could find a ship named \"The Cussler\" supposedly sunk there. Lindsay explained that they wanted to confirm The Cussler`s precise location and find out more about the sea currents that carried the ship there.\nEddie stayed on the ship while his wife went down in the sub to explore the area. He made sure the video and audio feed from the sub was working correctly. He knew that the sea currents clashing in the area change at predetermined intervals and that the whirling currents would dissipate for a while. After his wife discovered a ship, he confirmed it was The Cussler by looking at the Milokaross emblem on the hull.\nThe two archaeologists are now known for discovering what happened to The Cussler, where it precisely sunk as well as for pinpointing the sea currents deep within the ocean.",
