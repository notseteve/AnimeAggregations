  "description" : "Cassidy is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that occasionally runs across Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime.\nCassidy`s partner is Butch, and she is one of the few that usually manages to get his name right- much to his frustration, everyone else calls him either \"Biff\", \"Bill\", \"Bob\", \"Hutch\", \"Butcher\", \"Patch\", \"Botch\" or \"Buffy\" (コサンジ Kosanji in Japanese).\nCassidy and Jessie met either before or shortly after their both joining Team Rocket, and are assumed to have been rivals since then. The two women are almost equally vain. However, unlike Jessie, Cassidy keeps her cool easier and is much less prone to violent outbursts. Cassidy annoys Jessie to no end with her arrogance, and it appears that Cassidy likes instigating this frustration.\nCassidy is named after Butch Cassidy, an American outlaw. Her Japanese name, Yamato, is named after the 大和 Yamato, a World War II-era Japanese battleship. Its sister ship was the 武蔵 Musashi, one of Jessie`s namesakes.",
