  "description" : "Luviagelita or simply Luvia is a wealthy and proud young woman and mage.\nIn Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya she is assigned to work together with Rin to capture the Class Cards. After Sapphire abandons her, Luvia immediately adopts Sapphire`s new master, Miyu, and guides her to capture the Class Cards. She is indiscriminate in using her wealth, erecting a mansion across the street from Einzbern house in a single day, where she and Miyu are currently living. Her rivalry with Rin stems from their mutual crush on Shirou, who fails to notice their attraction to him\nSource: Wikipedia",
