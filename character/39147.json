  "description" : "Once one of Heero Yuy`s top aides, Dekim was present when the colonial leader was assassinated. From that moment on, he began plotting his revenge. However, even after he killed Odin Lowe (the man who shot Yuy), Dekim was not satisfied; he was convinced that the only way to make things equal after the decades of colonial oppression was for the colonies to take over the Earth Sphere, with the Barton family as the ruling family. To that end, he tracked down five of the engineers who had created the Tallgeese and commissioned them to create the Gundams for use with his ultimate plan: Operation Meteor. The original plan entailed dropping colonies onto Earth at strategic locations, and using the Gundams to take control in the ensuing chaos. For Dekim, the scientists and their young pilots didn`t agree with this plan, and stole the Gundams, using them instead to fight for the colonies` independence without resorting to genocide. Infuriated, Dekim began working out a new version of Operation Meteor. Using the Serpent mobile suit left behind by OZ, and the fact that his daughter Leia supposedly had a child with Treize Khushrenada, Dekim launched another Operation Meteor on Christmas Eve AC 196. However, his plan began to crumble once again, thanks to the intervention of the Gundam pilots (and later the common people themselves). Attempting to kill Relena Darlian, Dekim shot Mariemaia when she ran in front of Relena to protect her, then was himself shot in the head and killed by one of his soldiers, who immediately apologized to Treize for betraying his vision.",
