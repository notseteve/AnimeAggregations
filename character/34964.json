  "description" : "The fire control chief, and commander of the second bridge. Nicknamed the \"King of Fighters\" among the cadets, he is also an accomplished marksman. A very laid back young man with a strong will that doesn`t give into peer pressure and doesn`t believe that others should either, thus he gets frustrated with the other crew members who feel forced into staying on the ship. Takai also lost a father on the Guard Ship Maizuru but rather than fighting for vengeance like Alley Hisaka, he is more concerned about the justice of the Kingdom`s actions and uses the battles as a form of protest. Takai is considered third in command of the ship even though he directly states that he is unsuited for full leadership.",
