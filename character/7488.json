  "description" : "Franca is the codename of an expert on bombs and explosive materials who works as a freelancer with her partner Franco. An idealist by nature, Franca has strong morals and dislikes those who would kill indiscriminately. As a team, Franca and Franco are known within Padania for the quality of their bombs, which are said to be impossible to disarm. Some within the Five Republics Faction do not trust them because of their freelancer status. They operate an auto repair shop in Milan as a front for their clandestine business.\nFranca`s true identity is Caterina, a student who dropped out of her university in order to file a national lawsuit against the arrest of her father, who was imprisoned on charges of unspecified crimes. Shortly afterwards, the father died of suspicious causes during his incarceration. Convinced of her father`s innocence and angry at the Italian government`s apparent immoral attempts to silence political dissent, Caterina sought out various activists within Italy in an attempt to learn how to get revenge on the Italian government. At the recommendation of Mangello Marinov, a family friend, Caterina made contact with Franco, whose uncle was a well-known explosives expert. Although Franco was reluctant at first, he was soon moved by the strength of Caterina`s convictions. Caterina learned much from Franco and eventually took the name \"Franca\" as a cover identity since she would be working closely with Franco from then on.",
