  "description" : "Seedot is an acorn-like Pok√©mon found in the Hoenn region. It feeds by using the top of its head to attach itself to a tree branch and then proceed to suck moisture and nutrients from it. In this state, when still, it is seemingly impossible to distinguish it from a real acorn. It apparently appreciates this fact because it enjoys startling Pidgey foraging in the area by suddenly moving. When Seedot finishes feeding, its body becomes heavy enough that it drops to the ground with a clear thump.",
