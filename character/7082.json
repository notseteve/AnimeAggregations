  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch7004 [Touga]`s dramatic little sister, often used as comic relief throughout the series. Her love for her brother borders on obsession and incest, and she is often seen using devious scenes to punish the people who take her brother`s attentions away from her. Though her motivations are considered the simplest and least ambitious out of all the Duellists, they are no less real to her, and she suffers just as much as all the other http://anidb.net/ch9171 [Student Council] members throughout the series. Her Duelling Rose is yellow.\nShe is very fond of Touga to the point of their relationship having semi-incestuous edge, at least on her part. Nanami often makes various malicious attacks on students she deems inferior (or worse, those she suspects Touga is paying attention to).\nAfter Touga is wounded in a duel with http://anidb.net/ch6847 [Utena], she temporarily takes over as Student Council President, adopting a bright yellow uniform. In duels, Nanami uses a style of dual blade fencing.",
