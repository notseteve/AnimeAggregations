  "description" : "She is the bridge operator in charge of the sensors and hangar, and second-in-command to Jamil. She has a straightforward, by-the-book attitude that projects a rather stern image, particularly when Tiffa was brought aboard, as Jamil often focused his attention on the girl. She does, however, grow to become fond of Tiffa when she sees her abilities help protect the Freeden from danger.",
