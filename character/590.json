  "description" : "Skiploom is the evolution of Hoppip. Skiploom is somewhat similar to its previous form, albeit larger, and green. It has long dog-like ears, rather than the Cat-like ones of Hoppip. The leaves have turned into a large yellow flower. The flower on its head blossoms at 64 degrees Fahrenheit. As the temperature increases, the flower gradually opens further. This allows Skiploom to be used as a thermometer. It is capable of floating in the air, a skill it uses to get closer to the sun in order to better absorb the sunlight. When the sunlight is strong, its ability, Chlorophyll, increases its speed. When it rains, the flower instantly closes and Skiploom hides under a tree to avoid getting wet.",
