  "description" : "Ten`itsu has the appearance of a young woman with long blond hair. The earring she is wearing belongs to Suzaku. Unlike the other members of the Shinshou, she specializes more in magic than combat, particularly healing and clairvoyance. However, she is still able to create defensive shields with her magic. When someone has a very serious wound, she heals it by transferring the wound on her, something her lover and fellow Shinshou Suzaku distresses over.\nSource: Wiki",
