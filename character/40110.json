However, the potion wasn`t poisonous enough to kill her, but she is resurrected as a zombie after her father accidentally knocks her off a cliff (he was aiming for Baabu) to her death. As a zombie, she lives together with Chihiro in order to know how it feels to become free from her father`s chains.\nSource: Wikipedia",
