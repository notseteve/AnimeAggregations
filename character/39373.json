  "description" : "Hikaru is the Media Club President at Misumaru Middle School, so she`s always on the lookout for a big scoop. She and http://anidb.net/ch39367 [Shun] are like two peas in a pod - they`re constantly exchanging information and plotting various schemes together. Hikaru and Shun are also usually appointed as MCs for school events. Hikaru is very cheerful, and has the uncanny ability to find humor in any situation.\nSource: shingu.rightstuf.com",
