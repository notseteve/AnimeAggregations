  "description" : "Jin Kisaragi is a former Major in the NOL and one of its elite commanding officers as well as the rival to Ragna. He is always cool and calm, but is also jealous, ambitious, and possessive with little care for others, treating them like they are mere obstacles. He displayed formidable actions to gain his rank during the Ikaruga Civil War. When he heard that Ragna the Bloodedge had arrived on the scene, he quickly abandoned his post to hunt him down by himself. The truth, however, is that Ragna is Jin`s biological brother, and Jin`s early feelings of rivalry were furthered by his visions of the future and his Nox Nyctores` amplification of his emotions. Terumi caused Jin`s mind to hack off Ragna`s arm (later nearly dying without the intervention of Rachel) and supposedly kill Saya, and Jin often says that he`s looking forward to killing Ragna again. After the incident, he was adopted into the Kisaragi house, a highly powerful and respected family within the NOL. He possesses a notable psychosis, said to be caused by his sword, the Nox Nyctores Mucro Algesco: Yukianesa.\nSource: Wikipedia ",
