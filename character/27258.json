  "description" : "Unfezant, known as the Proud Pokémon, evolves from Tranquill, and is the final form of Pidove. Unfezant are one of the few Pokémon to have very noticeable gender differences. The males have large, pink, ribbon-like wattles, and green underbellies. The females have a small crest, and brown underbellies. Males swing their head plumage to threaten opponents, and will never let themselves feel close to anyone other than their trainers. The females have flying abilities that surpass those of the males.",
