After his mind was corrupted by Jagi, Shin challenged Kenshirou and defeated him, engraving the seven scars on his chest, subsequently taking off with Yuria by force.\nHe then forms the King organisation and builds Yuria the city of Southern Cross. However, he is unable to win Yuria`s love and after her failed suicide attempt, Shin entrusts her to the Nanto Goshasei for her protection. Sometime after, he is challenged by Kenshirou in his lair and is defeated. Refusing to die from Kenshirou`s technique, he takes his own life by jumping off the roof of his own palace, while maintaining that Yuria has died.",
