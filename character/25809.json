  "description" : "Rin`s younger twin brother. Though Satan`s powers were expected to be split between them, due to the weakness of Yukio`s body at birth, Yukio did not inherit any of Satan`s powers. Yukio received a Mashou at birth from his brother, allowing him to become aware of demons since he can remember. Yukio secretly trained to become an Exorcist since age seven in order to protect Rin (through the help of Fujimoto). While both Yukio and Rin are in their first year at True Cross Academy, Yukio is already an instructor at the Exorcist cram school who teaches Anti-Demon Pharmacology to Rin`s class. It is often stated that Yukio is a genius, having already acquired the title \"Meister\" in both the Dragoon and Doctor class, while ordinarily most people would aim for Meister in one class (both are still fully qualified exorcists). He is currently ranked a Middle First class exorcist.",
