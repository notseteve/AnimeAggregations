  "description" : "A popular and carefree classmate of Momo`s. Sae goes after him after Momo lies that she likes him to protect her and Toji`s relationship, but he is the only boy to see straight through Sae for what she really is. He has the reputation of being a playboy, something he is not exactly proud of. He thought that Momo was the one who once gave him CPR, when he had nearly drowned at the beach, when they were younger - only to later find out he had been saved by the local male lifeguard. His interest in her is renewed when Sae spreads rumors about them being a couple - he adds to this by claiming he has kissed Momo. When Momo is upset by his rumour he tries to make the rumor true, by kissing her unexpectedly in the beginning of the series.",
