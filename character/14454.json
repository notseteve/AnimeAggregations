  "description" : "Another \"returning\" supporting character, Miss Keane first appears in episode 3. She is very pretty and loved by her male students, although the female students don`t like her as much, especially Himeko. Miss Keane, like the original, is kind and incredibly patient. She is talented in many ways, which she used to counter Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup`s excuses; this includes knowledge on medicine for non-existent medical conditions, such as dislocation of the stomach, and is able to speak mole and English. She is also unfazed by the destruction Mojo causes and speaks to him as if he were a normal human being. In fact, in episode 33 when Mojo asks her out on a date, she gladly accepts and even enjoys the date (though she still treats him as a monkey, as in ordering a \"monkey ticket\" for him at a movie house while getting an adult ticket for herself). At the end of that episode, though, it is also revealed that Miss Keane has a mole-man boyfriend named Uneo, who appears in an earth-tunneling vehicle that emerges from the ground to pick her up.",
