  "description" : "A highly skilled professional sniper hired by the Eastern Bloc. He is unusually concerned about his killing style, and he never does anything that would ruin it. When he is contracted for a hit, he only works during the day. He uses an old rifle (a Remington 700) that is already an antique, and he uses only one bullet. He kills only his target, and he always kills with a shot to the head. This is the iron-clad style that he has stuck to for his entire life as a sniper. His skills are top notch, but Mylene makes fun of him because he is so concerned with his style.",
