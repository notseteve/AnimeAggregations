  "description" : "The Shellder at the Cerulean City Gym made only one appearance in the anime during the episode The Misty Mermaid. It was in an underwater ballet written by Violet, one of Misty`s three sisters.\nIn the middle of the play it was seen among a few of the Gym`s and Misty`s other Pokemon sleeping next to the giant shell Misty slept in. Other than this short appearance, it really had no other effect on the play or episode, as it was only seen in a couple points as an extra in the play. Its appearance wasn`t significant. It remains at the Cerulean City gym.",
