  "description" : "Drifloon resembles a toy balloon with two strings and cross-like patch. Drifloon has a wispy cloud on its head, and the ends of its two strings resemble hearts. According to its Pokédex entry, it attempts to abduct children but is so light that it ends up being pulled along instead, much like it was a balloon on a string. Drifloon and its evolution are the only two Pokémon that are ghost- and flying-type. Its classification as the `Balloon` Pokémon is shared with Igglybuff and its evolutions Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff as well as the water/poison Pokémon Qwilfish. The creature appears in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and the episode \"Drifloon on the Wind\" where it belongs to a Nurse Joy and her two daughters, Marnie (Sayaki) and Paige (Mai). Drifloon can only be obtained at the Valley Windworks on Fridays after defeating Commander Mars of Team Galactic for the first time",
