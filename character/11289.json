  "description" : "Kokoro is the soon-to-be girlfriend of Kippei. She is quiet, and rather lonesome as she lost her mother at an early age. This makes it easy for her to sympathize with Yuzuyu. Her father married another woman and thinking Kokoro could fend on her own, rents her a luxurious apartment to live in. The truth is, that is not the case. At the end of Volume 6 she tells her friends that she might be pregnant. Later, she finds out she`s not. Kokoro starts living with Kippei`s family at the end of chapter 29. Kokoro is understanding of Kippei`s responsibility to spend most of his time with Yuzuyu. Despite her popularity and Kippei`s idiocy, Kokoro`s heart remains loyal to Kippei to the fact that she would even ignore his past promiscuous days. Her name means \"heart\". She likely married Kippei at the end of the manga.",
