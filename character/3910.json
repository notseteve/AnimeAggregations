  "description" : "Ueki Kousuke is the main character in the series. He is in Class 1-C at Hinokuni Junior High School. Ueki`s ability is given to him by Kobayashi (a.k.a. Mr. K), who is also Ueki`s homeroom teacher. He is also seen wearing pinkish-red shoes during his first fight with Robert Haydn.\nUeki is an unusually calm individual, and doesn`t care about what happens to him. He can be found snoozing in class, letting children use him as a target for shooting soccer balls (or in one case, a surfboard),and also calling the police without panicking when he faces a gang of rowdy teenagers. However, he cares for people around them, even going as far as saving Robert Haydn from falling debris in the Dogura Mansion. He also seems have a strong battle sense, as he often finds his opponent`s weak points, or unique strategies to defeat them\nAccording to a short profile of the main characters of The Law of Ueki (published in the end of manga vol. 16 by the author), Ueki`s hobbies include cleaning up his town. In the first volume of the manga, Ueki is seen planting trees in the town park.\nUeki is a genuinely kind person who is always trying to help people. Ueki is actually a heavenly being sent to Earth by his father in order to take part in this tournament. Being a heavenly being allows him powers beyond his tree-making skills.\nTaken from Wikipedia",
