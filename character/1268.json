  "description" : "Uxie, known as the Knowledge Pokémon, has a yellow and round head with a jewel (probably a ruby), embedded in its forehead, and in its Sugimori art it appears to be sleeping, or closing its eyes in deep thought. Uxie`s name comes from the word pixie, a small mythical creature, and \"you\", U being short for it. The other members of the Psychic-type, Mew like Lake Trio, Mesprit and Azelf, represent \"me\" and \"us\", respectively. It is also a possibility that these three Pokémon are inspired from a trio of Arabian goddesses, Al-Lat (Azelf), Manat (Mesprit), and Al-Uzza (Uxie). This is further supported by their moniker as Mirage Pokémon (as mirages are something associated with the Arabian desert), and that the three appear to be wearing jeweled turbans, which are associated with Arabic royalty. Uxie`s eyelids are also yellow, although they are obviously not part of the top of the head where the other yellow is. Uxie also resembles a religious monk. Its head resembles a human brain, since it is the Knowledge Pokémon. Like Mesprit and Azelf, its partners in the legendary trio, it has two tails with jewels embedded in them, and the only major difference between them is their heads and their faces. It is also believed that the mystic trio was all hatched from the same egg.\nUxie is referred to as \"The Being of Knowledge\". It is said that the wisdom that enriches the lives of humans was brought with the birth of Uxie. Similar to the legend of the basilisk where the basilisk could cause death by a single glance, Uxie can cause a complete loss of memory by a single glance of its open eyes; hence, its eyes are always closed, even when it is in battle.",
