She reached the age when her father though that she could finally have her own Pokémon and Hattori asked A-class Pokémon Sommeliers Cilan and Pinot Noir to evaluate which Pokémon would be best for her.\nWhile Momotchi was playing on her swing, she met a Tamagetake who played with her on the swing but she never told her father about it because he was not that fond of Tamagetake. Cilan though was able to figure out that Tamagetake`s bond with Momotchi was the best and Momotchi father Hattori apologized to his daughter and allowed her to keep it as her friend.",
