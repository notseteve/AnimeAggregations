  "description" : "Joshua is Ray`s brother and is talkative, upbeat and sociable. Though he deeply cares for Ray, he is entirely different in behaviour than his older brother. Joshua claims his brother changed to his present behaviour after his wife, Yoshimo`s, died at the hands of the Claw Man, and although he also loved Yoshimo, he wishes for Ray to accept her death and return home instead of exacting his revenge on her killer. Joshua has great technical skills, being able to repair numerous everyday items, analyze armor weaknesses, and even set up timed explosives. Joshua is somewhat dense when it concerns females, however, since he just walks in on Priscilla when she was taking a shower.\nWhen he and Wendy first meet, they instantly get along, probably because they share so much in common. However, Van finds Joshua very annoying, and when Joshua is hospitalized after being injured when Ray confronts the Clawed Man for the first time in the series, Van leaves Joshua behind, but the latter manages to catch up with help from Carmen 99, and they rejoin Van and Wendy for the final showdown.\nWhen Ray is killed, Joshua rushes to his aid, only to find himself captured by the Clawed Man. However, before Yukiko can bust him out, he has already escaped, vowing to put a stop to the plan his older brother managed to stall before dying, and saves Yukiko as well. He is instrumental in the final battle as he succeeds in cutting power to Birthday thereby halting the Claw Man`s plans.",
