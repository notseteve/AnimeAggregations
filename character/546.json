  "description" : "Noctowl is the second owl Pokémon, being the evolution of Hoothoot. It is a large bird whose plumage is colored in various shades of brown. Its round head has two piercing, red eyes and two large \"eyebrows\". These eyebrows help balance Noctowl while it is flying to increase its aerodynamics. When hunting, Noctowl puts its prodigious eyesight to good use to hunt down prey without fail. It is also very good at sneaking up to its victims unnoticed thanks to its supple, soft-feathered wings that allow it to fly without making any noise. When a Noctowl needs to ponder especially deep thoughts, it can rotate its head 180 degrees, which serves to increase its intellectual faculties.\nIn the anime, a shiny Noctowl has been part of Ash`s team during his travels in Johto. Ash frequently used his Noctowl to explore an area from the sky, or to puncture Team Rocket`s hot-air balloon. Ash used it in many battles throughout Johto, but it is currently living in Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start and leave all of his Pokémon except for Pikachu when he left for Hoenn.",
