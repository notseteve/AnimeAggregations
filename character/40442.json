  "description" : "Koharu`s Deerling made first appearance when it was set out with Koharu`s other Pokémon so that Ash could see which Pokémon she had so he`d be interested in trading his Ash`s Scraggy with her. Later, when Garbodor was raging, Cilan asked Koharu if her Deerling knew Aromatherapy, which it did, so Koharu ordered her Koharu`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor. Aromatherapy was effective and Garbodor wandered back into the forest.",
