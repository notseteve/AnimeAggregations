  "description" : "Head of the Yasha clan and one of the strongest warriors in Tenkai, Yasha-Ou serves as the bushinshou of the north. Wanting to prove his friend Kuy-Ou the stargazer`s prophecy, he awoke Ashura and became his protector even though she had also predicted that Ashura would kill him and knowing that this act of rebellion would anger Taishakuten. As a result of his not turning over Ashura to Taishakuten, his entire clan was declared renegade and slaughtered by Bishamonten.\nWhen Yasha-Ou was still a child, Ashura-Ou (knowing that Yasha was the one who would awaken Ashura) asked him what he would do if the most important person in the world to him was fated to bring him disaster. Yasha replied that he would \"protect him\". Ashura-Ou then told him to become strong so as to protect the one thing that he would value above all others in the future. His real name is Yama, having taken the name of Yasha-Ou when he became the leader of his tribe.",
