  "description" : "Okumura Kunikazu is the CEO of Okumura Foods, and the father of Okumura Haru. A ruthless and ambitious businessman, he oppresses his employees, imposing punishing working conditions on them, treating them like disposable robots, and cuts corners where he can get away with it for the sake of profit. There is a mysterious swell of support for him to be targeted by the Phantom Thieves on the Phan-Site. He is also forcing Haru into a marriage with a horrible man solely to advance his political ambitions, adding further pressure for him to be targeted.\n\nThis turns out to be a well-orchestrated trap. The Phantom Thieves change his heart, but shortly after, the black-masked man assassinates his Shadow form in the Metaverse, causing him to die just as he is in the middle of a press conference where he confesses his misdeeds. The Phantom Thieves are blamed for his death and public support for them crumbles.\n",
