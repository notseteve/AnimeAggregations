  "description" : "A famous ace pilot of the Earth Alliance, who brings his Moebius Zero mobile armor aboard the Archangel after his original mothership is destroyed. Mu earned the nickname \"Hawk of Endymion\" by singlehandedly shooting down five ZAFT mobile suits in one of the war`s early battles. Aside from his piloting skills, tactical abilities, and extensive combat experience, Mu`s greatest contribution to the Archangel is probably the morale boost provided by his relaxed and lighthearted personality.",
