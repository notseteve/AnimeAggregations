  "description" : "Lopunny is the evolved form of Buneary. Its evolution is dependent on the Pokémon`s happiness with its trainer. It is a bipedal rabbit with large, fluffy ears. It normally holds its arms to its chest, giving it a shy, bashful countenance. It also seems to be clumsy as defined by one of its two abilities, Klutz. Lopunny often hides behind its ears. It made its debut in the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, where one is used by the Elite Four member, Flint.",
