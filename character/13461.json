  "description" : "A young man who is the only human capable of seeing both Plug and Alesta. He works at a family restaurant and has a rather short temper, which results in frequently hitting Plug (and at times Alesta as well) with a baseball bat or whatever is within reach; this has become a running gag in the series. He occassionally helps Plug and Alesta with their work, teaching Plug that the best way to find an opportunity to charge is to make one yourself. He lives with his younger sister.",
