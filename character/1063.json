  "description" : "The fictional Pok√©mon Dusclops is said to be like a black hole: it absorbs matter into its body, through its mouth, never releasing the matter. What happens to the absorbed matter is unknown; theories suggest that inside Dusclops` body is a spectral ball of fire, though it cannot be confirmed. Dusclops also possesses the gift of hypnosis; it can control other conscious beings. It sways the victim into hypnosis by waving its hands and gazing into the victim`s eyes.",
