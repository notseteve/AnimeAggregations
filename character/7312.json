  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch7003 [Miki]`s twin sister, Kozue feels shadowed by her brother`s talents and reacts by sleeping with many different men. She`s extremely possessive of Miki to the point where she physically hurts anyone who tries to hurt or \"steal\" him. She feels overshadowed by his talent and dirtied by comparison with him. Kozue resents Miki`s affection for http://anidb.net/ch6889 [Himemiya Anthy] and is prone to \"acting out\" to grab her brother`s attention, most notably by exercising loose sexual morals. Like http://anidb.net/ch7082 [Nanami], Kozue also seems to have an extreme brother complex. She is very protective of Miki and is the reason that he does not have a girlfriend (despite the affection of many of his schoolmates).",
