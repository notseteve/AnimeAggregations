  "description" : "Tsuchiya Kei is Miki`s coworker at Bobson`s ice cream parlor who is a talented but troubled pianist. He also falls in love with Miki, and tries to use Miki`s lost medallion to cause Yuu to think Miki doesn`t want him anymore. This fails however, as Yuu sees through his lies and, though he fights with Miki, they make up. Miki yells at Kei for his immaturity, and forgives him. After some convincing by Miki to regain his confidence in music, Kei quits his job at Bobson`s ice cream parlor and says goodbye to Miki, promising to return soon. He is later seen in the regular company of Suzu who started following him after seeing him play the piano. Later, Kei began to grow some feelings for Suzu.",
