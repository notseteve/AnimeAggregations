  "description" : "Bill is a famous Pokémon researcher who lives at a beach near a white cliff. Ash and his friends encounter Bill as they went looking for a phone for Ash to contact Professor Oak to find out how his Krabby was.\nAfter overhearing Ash talking to Professor Oak on the phone, Bill revealed himself by turning on the lights but he was in a Kabuto costume as he wanted to know just what extinct Pokémon were feeling when they lived on the planet.\nWhile at the lighthouse, he was waiting for just one Pokémon to show up. One day, he could hear a voice from across the sea so he created a similar sound and sent it across the sea from this lighthouse. That same Pokémon arrived the day Ash and his friends were there but was scared off by Team Rocket. He wasn`t exactly sure what Pokémon it was, but it made his determination to study Pokémon even greater.",
