  "description" : "A side story character in SAO. She was a member of \"Black Cats of the Night\" which was the first guild Kirito joined. Kirito was especially attached to her. However she died along with the majority of her guild members which led to Kirito wallowing in despair and self-loathing until he read the time delayed message she left for Kirito. Even after the message gave him the strength to live, he never joined another guild until he parties with Asuna.\nSource: Wiki",
