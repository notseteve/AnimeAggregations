  "description" : "Officer Jenny is the local law enforcement leader in the Kalos region. Each city and area has a Jenny who looks exactly the same as she does elsewhere in the Kalos region though they do look different compared to their Jenny counterparts elsewhere in the Pokémon World. The most noticeable different between Kalos region Jenny and those from elsewhere in the Pokémon World is their haircut.",
