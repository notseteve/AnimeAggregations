  "description" : "The nine-tailed demon fox (九尾の妖狐, Kyuubi no Youko) is the most powerful of the tailed beasts. It is regarded as an age-old natural disaster, as a single swipe of one of its tails can raise tsunamis and flatten mountains. Twelve years before the start of the series, the fox attacked http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konohagakure]. Its attack was stopped by the http://anidb.net/ch8866 [Fourth Hokage], who gave his life to seal the fox into his son, http://anidb.net/ch240 [Uzumaki Naruto]. Throughout the series, Naruto tries to gain dominance over the fox, as harnessing its great strength allows him to perform jutsu that would normally be impossible for a ninja of his age. At the same time the fox tries to gain control over Naruto, provoking his rage and thus allowing its violent personality to influence and consume him. As Naruto draws upon more of the fox`s power the seal keeping it trapped within him weakens, and in the event the seal is broken the fox will be released.\nSource: Wikipedia",
