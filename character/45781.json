  "description" : "The 17-year-old niece of Dan Morihiko is a renowned detective novel author, having published successful books while in high school. She didn`t want to be a detective at all at first, because she wanted to be a mystery novel writer. She`s in her 2nd year in Senior High School in the DDS. She received her first award from the police in 3rd grade in elementary school. She also barely mentions that Dan Morihiko is her uncle, since she desires to ascend in the DDS on her own. Fiercely competitive, more hot-headed than she lets other see, and quite stern on others and herself. She`s a friendly rival of Kyu (the only one who knows her relationship to Dan), and she possibly has a crush on him, and is a good friend of Megu and Kuniko.\nSource: Wiki",
