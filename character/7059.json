  "description" : "Sae is an upperclassman and good friends with http://anidb.net/ch7058 [Hiro]. Her artistic specialties are photography and fiction writing; she writes fiction professionally under the pseudonym \"Tachibana Aya\" (橘文) and enrolled at the school specifically so she could learn how to illustrate her own work. Sae, who is tall, athletic, and generally mature, has a playful side that can be at the same time enigmatic and cunning; she has a habit of giving http://anidb.net/ch7056 [Yuno] just enough warning about potential problems for the younger girl to fail to avoid them. She also has a fondness for playing detective when faced with such anomalies as http://anidb.net/ch7057 [Miyako]`s apartment. She tends to get upset when Miyako refers to her as having masculine qualities. She also gets very uncomfortable when asked about her love life, frequently inventing a history for herself that even cursory examination would show to be absurd, while blushing furiously.",
