  "description" : "Tensou is an Inukami in http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s pack. She wears overalls and has long brown hair that falls down to cover her eyes. Tensou rarely talks, instead opting to draw on her sketch pad a picture of what the person just described. The drawings are done fast and with much detail and accuracy. When Tensou does speak, it is in a low, quiet voice, normally only supplementing what others say. She is perhaps the most reclusive of the Inukami, but is close friends with http://anidb.net/ch10256 [Gokyouya] and http://anidb.net/ch10258 [Furano].",
