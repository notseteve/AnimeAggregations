  "description" : "The Death Scythe in charge of East Asia. She comes off as being bookish and analytical, and is very respectful to all. She accidentally gave Marie the idea of marrying a toilet and then talked her out of it using wordplay. She was the student council president when Stein and the other Death Scythes were students, and scolded Spirit, for his endless flirting, and Stein, for his urge to dissect everything. She was said to have been a small, yet talkative child. She still treats the others as little kids like a teacher would (clapping to get their attention and telling them to line up and walk in a single file line) much to the embarrassment of the others. She is suggested to have a genius IQ, and is an extremely competent information gatherer and tactician, easily finding one of Arachnophobia`s labs. In weapon form, she takes the form of a crossbow-like sniper rifle and fires compressed soul wavelength with high accuracy, stating herself she can shoot a target up to 10 km away with only a 1 mm margin of error.",
