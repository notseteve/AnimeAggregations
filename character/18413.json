  "description" : "Queen Victoria is the Queen of the United Kingdom and has been described as having great beauty and grace. Despite this, she is a bit eccentric, this is seen when she enters a curry contest while riding a horse. After the death of her husband, she does not appear in public often and begins to cry hysterically whenever he is mentioned.\nShe nearly attempted suicide because of the grief over her dead husband until Ash approached her. Ash gave her youth and attached a part of her husband`s skin from her neck to her clavicle area. Because the skin continues to rot, it causes her great pain. When Ash tries to fix the problem, she refuses to let him. She also plays a villainous role, becoming part of the Organization for everlasting youth and being the one who ordered the destruction of the Phantomhive Family. She later dies and a look-alike is placed on the throne.",
