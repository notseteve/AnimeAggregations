  "description" : "Souther represents the \"Star of Leadership\", which rules over the other Nanto stars. His fighting style is Nanto Hou-ouken (\"South Star Phoenix Fist), the strongest of the Nanto Seiken, which is a purely offensive style with no defensive stance. Souther was orphaned as an infant and was raised by the previous Hou-ouken successor, Oogai, who trained him during childhood. During his final training lesson, Souther unwillingly killed his master, who intentionally allowed himself to be killed by Souther. Traumatised by the event, Souther disavowed all feelings of love and compassion. After the Nuclear War, he takes on the title of Holy Emperor and enslaves children with his army in order to construct the Holy Cross Mausoleum, a shrine to his deceased master.\nKenshirou challenges Souther, but his Hokuto Shinken techniques proves to be ineffective against him and is brutally defeated and captured. Kenshirou escapes and challenges Souther again. This time, he learns the secret of Souther`s immunity (he has dextrocardia, affecting the locations of his pressure points), and is able to defeat him.",
