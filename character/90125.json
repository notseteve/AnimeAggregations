  "description" : "Daryl Cavendish was born as the youngest daughter of the House of Cavendish, being her older sister, http://anidb.net/ch90124 [Bernadette], the heiress of the family. At some point, she had his two daughters, http://anidb.net/ch90127 [Maryl] and http://anidb.net/ch90126 [Meryl]. Daryl was never at all in agreement with the actions of her sister as head of the family, considering that she placed too much importance on traditions and magic.\nWhen her sister passed away, being her niece http://anidb.net/ch52148 [Diana] too young to inherit the leadership of the family, Daryl became the unofficial leader of the House of Cavendish. During this time, Daryl was forced to face the decline of family resources due to the increasing disappearance of magic in the world, which led her to fulfill her ideals of putting money over family traditions.\nSource: Little Witch Academia",
