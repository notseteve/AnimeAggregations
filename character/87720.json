  "description" : "Akutsu Shin is a descendant from a family of kabuki performers. He is aware of kabuki and knows many of its customs but resents it for unknown reasons. He attempts instead to form a rock band, but he is tone deaf and doesn`t get along with his fellow members. Akutsu is noted to be fairly talented at kabuki, however his deeply narcissistic personality along his recurrent need to be the center of attention are his major setbacks.\nSource: English Wikipedia",
