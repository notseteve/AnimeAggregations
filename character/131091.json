  "description" : "Tabuchi Saburou was a human who was selected by the angel Egura to be a God candidate. He was a young man with short dark hair and glasses, usually seen wearing neat clothes. When he wanted to keep his identity hidden, Tabuchi wore a costume that disguised him as the TV superhero Metroyellow. Like Metropoliman`s costume, Tabuchi`s costume completely obscured his body and facial features, leaving his identity a secret.\nSource: Platinum End Wikia",
