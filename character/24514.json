  "description" : "Professor Kodama`s Quagsire lives with him at his lab. It wasn`t getting alone with Magnemite so Professor Kodama decided to make a machine that would get them to like each other. Unfortunately it didn`t work on either of them.\nWhen the machine was stolen by Team Rocket, Quagsire used its Water Gun to project Magnemite really fast towards the balloon to stop Team Rocket. Working together, Magnemite and Quagsire were able to start to patch things up between them.",
