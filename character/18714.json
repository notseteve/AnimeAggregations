  "description" : "The Vanish Brothers are two nameless mercenaries from the Southern Wolves Guild (of who they refer to their guild leader as \"Mama\"), hired by Duke Everlue to bodyguard his mansion. Their name comes from the fact that while their target focusing on one of the brothers, they take their eyes off the other allowing the unseen brother to attack. They confront Natsu after Lucy, Happy and he manage to infiltrate the mansion looking for a book to destroy at the behest of their client. The two think they can easily overcome mages since they figure mages only strengthen their magic and not their bodies like they do. However Natsu proves them wrong by overcoming their attacks and easily takes both out at the same time.",
