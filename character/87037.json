  "description" : "Team Skull is the villainous team in the Alola region.\nTeam Skull appears in Sun and Moon. As revealed by some of their members, Team Skull is composed of misfits who failed the Island challenge. They steal Pokémon from people, but unlike previous villainous teams, they do not have a specific goal other than to cause trouble.\nTeam Skull originated from a group that coalesced around one of Alola`s kahunas. This group provoked the wrath of the four island deities and was struck down. The survivors became the first members of Team Skull. At some point, Team Skull took over Po Town on Ula`ula Island, driving away the original residents.\nAt some point, Lusamine became the secret benefactor of Team Skull, and they, in turn, started to carry out her orders.\nAfter Guzma is rescued from Ultra Space by the player, he disbands Team Skull and its members go their separate ways. Guzma returns to his parents` house on Melemele Island, while Plumeria takes up residence in a camper on Route 13 and later challenges the Alola Pokémon League. One Grunt becomes an apprentice chef under Mallow in Konikoni City, while two others in the Po Town Pokémon Center offer a Skull Tank for sale in order for them to make enough money to leave. Others are taken by Hala to train in Iki Town, deciding to become a rescue team and dubbing themselves \"Team Reskull\".\nTeam Skull makes their first appearance in Alola to New Adventure!, where three Team Skull Grunts were seen harassing Kiawe in front of the Pokémon School. Though the three Grunts outnumbered Kiawe and Ash, they emerged victorious though the combined efforts of Ash`s Pikachu and Kiawe`s Turtonator. More Grunts appeared in a flashback in SM005, where they were harassing a Popplio on the beach until Lana intervened by freezing them solid with her Ride Pokémon, Lapras.",
