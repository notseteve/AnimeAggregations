  "description" : "Torristan is Prince Toma`s half-bird warrior and one of his elite fighters. He is capable of making his feathers as hard as steel and using them as daggers or shurikens. Torristan always wears a mask which both hides his chicken-like face and also makes his voice slightly deeper.\nTorristan kidnapped Shampoo for his bride, but Mousse arrived shortly thereafter to save her. This proved more difficult than expected, however, as the grueling battle nearly took Mousse`s life in the process. As Mousse nearly reached his end, he mustered all of his remaining energy to defeat Torristan with a single punch, but doing so cost him all of his strength and he soon fainted, falling into Shampoo`s arms.",
