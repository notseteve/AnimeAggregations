  "description" : "The manager of the film studio works to make sure the personnel and Pok√©mon on set are ready for filming. When Ditto went missing after being yelled at by Kublock, she explained that Mr. Kublock is so strict with Ditto because he believed that it could do much, much better than it was initially performing. He was the one who discovered Ditto in the first place.\nShe went searching around the city and area for Ditto but was then told by Team Rocket to bring a ransom money for them to release it to her. With Ash Ketchum and Goh`s help, they retrieved Ditto. She took it back to set and it performed well for the director.",
