  "description" : "Fujioka Kotoko was Haruhi`s mother, who died when her daughter was still very young. Haruhi remarks in the first episode that it has been ten years since her mother died, which makes her about five years old at that time. She was an attorney at law; Haruhi takes after her in some ways and she remains Haruhi`s role-model. If the way in which Haruhi recalls her in her memories and dreams is accurate, she was a dedicated and loving mother who wished the best for her family. One can assume she was also open-minded to live with and love her husband, \"Ranka\". He states that Kotoko was both beautiful and intelligent and reveals that she was a closet fan of the St. Lobelia`s Zuka Club of her day. In later chapters, it is shown that she was popular at her law school and, in a recent omake, that she found Ryoji to be strange and annoying, but all the same liked him from the first moment they met.",
