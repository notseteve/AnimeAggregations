  "description" : "Axew, known as the Tusk Pokémon. It is a bipedal, greenish-colored Pokémon with noticeable nostrils and pale tusks protruding from the sides of its mouth. It was described by IGN as a \"baby parasaurolophus\". It leaves gashes on trees and shrubs with its tusks in order to mark its territory and is capable of immediately regrowing broken tusks.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Iris owns an Axew, which was introduced in \"Enter Iris and Axew!\". She carries it in her extensive hair, rather than in a Poké Ball (similar to Ash`s Pikachu).\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated \"I kind of dig Axew\", saying he looks \"pretty cute\", and \"his stance says he`s ready for anything\".",
