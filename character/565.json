  "description" : "Ampharos are powerful, bipedal creatures, after gaining the ability to stand upright full-time upon evolution from Flaaffy. Its sleek yellow body is marked with black rings around its neck, and tail. It has black markings along its horns as well as the orbs on its body. Ampharos has powerful light abilities, its main light sources being the large orbs on its tail and head, and because of this is often used as a beacon in lighthouses, and mythical legend says that these lights can even be seen from outer space. Before the introduction of modern technology, Ampharos` light was used to communicate between long distances, in much a similar way to smoke signals.",
