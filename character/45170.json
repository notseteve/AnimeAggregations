  "description" : "The second unit of the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam, which was designed to fight against psycommu-equipped mobile suits as a core component of the UC Project. It has already undergone final adjustments, including operating tests under gravity, and has been given specially designed psycho-frame equipment known as \"armed armor.\" As a result, although it is of the same type as the first unit, its level of completeness is far higher.",
