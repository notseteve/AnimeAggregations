  "description" : "Kilik is a pot meister and is often teamed up with Ox for missions. Kilik uses a pair of twins as his weapons, Pot of Fire and Pot of Thunder. Though termed \"pots\", they resemble large gloves in their weapon form. Out of weapon form they resemble small girl and boy with blue eyes. Kilik also seems to be pretty agile, having the second best running time in Shibusen after Black Star. He seems to be on the brash side, as he tried to immediately find Kim after she fled Shibusen. His partners Fire and Thunder are earth shamans and can hear the earth`s voice. His attacks emphasize on the raw punching power of his elemental pots. He can conduct a Soul Resonance with one of the pots, to use a more powerful attack with that pot, or a Soul Resonance with both to attack the opponent with both fire and lightning.",
