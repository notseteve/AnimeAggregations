  "description" : "Nu-13 is a Murakumo Unit who was forged in Kagutsuchi`s Gates of Sheol. She was programmed to terminate anyone she deems as hostile subjects that come near the Gate. Nu is also shown to have a split personality, split between an emotionless girl when around others and a clingy young girl when around Ragna. Nu wants to absorb Ragna and have him join her in destroying the world, because she, too, possesses a piece of the Azure Grimoire (although neither she nor Ragna realized the pieces they possess are actually imitations). When Ragna refuses to join her and breaks her heart, she decides to take him by force. She also knows Hakumen, recognizing him as a \"Sankishin Unit\". She, as with Noel, was made as a replica of Saya, Ragna and Jin`s sister who is presumed to be dead. They seem to share some of Saya`s memories, though nothing congruous.\nSource: Wikipedia",
