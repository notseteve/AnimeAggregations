  "description" : "A cheerful boy who dreams of being a paramedic, http://anidb.net/ch6556 [Ayumi] falls for Mamoru quickly when he offers to take her to the nurse. Although he is in Ayumi`s class, Ayumi only realizes that he is in fact http://anidb.net/ch6565 [Misao]`s younger brother a day after she meets Misao. He is somewhat taken back by Ayumi; he believes she is more fearsome than she may appear. Furthermore, despite Ayumi`s feelings, Mamoru has a crush on his next door neighbor http://anidb.net/ch6567 [Misaki Yamamoto]. He later runs away with http://anidb.net/ch6562 [Kusuda] and http://anidb.net/ch6564 [Sogabe] after he was turned down by Misaki. He then has a change of heart after realizing he made Ayumi cry due to his actions. He shares a passing resemblance to Kojima, a character from another of Kawashita`s work, Lilim Kiss, as well as http://anidb.net/ch8848 [Manaka Junpei] from http://anidb.net/a3067 [Ichigo 100%].",
