  "description" : "Shiomiya Shiori is a reticent girl who loves to read books. She is a member of the Library Committee, which acts as the governing body and librarian for the school library. Her official position is a secretary. She has always wanted to talk to others but finds that she cannot articulate as fast as her thought process, as a result by the time she has formulated a response to something, the conversation has already moved on. From the beginning, Keima immediately catches her attention and anger by saying that physical books are no longer necessary in a digital era. As Keima continues to vandalize the books in the library, she becomes more conversational each time. Near the end of her story arc, she learns that three thousand books are to be disposed of to accommodate an audio-visual booth. Protesting, she locks down the building and barricades herself in the library. After Keima literally descends into the library and gives her \"courage\", she finally overcomes her silence.\nShe starts to write a story based on her faint memories during Keima`s capture, though the parts including Keima are erased.\nThe cause of Shiori`s crevice in the heart was her will to speak out her mind, when she had doubts of a good reply.\nHer name comes from Shionomiya Station (汐ノ宮駅, Shionomiya-eki).",
