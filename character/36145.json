  "description" : "Shigeki, or Shige, is a forward specializing in evasion and dodging techniques. He is said to be the one of the best players in the school. He quit the soccer club during his first year because the upperclassmen didn`t play seriously, so he got bored playing. But after Shou joined the club, he decided it was interesting again and decided to rejoin. Shige is never serious and usually jokes around a lot. He enjoys making-up nicknames for his friends.\nSource: wiki",
