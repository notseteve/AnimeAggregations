  "description" : "Akiha is Shiki`s younger sister and the current head of the Touno house. She is extremely proper and rather strict, especially when it comes to her brother. Although she acts cold a lot of the time, she truly does care about Shiki and only wants for him to be safe and happy.\nAs a member of the Touno clan, Akiha has powerful demonic blood running in her veins and has the ability to steal the \"heat\" from others. She has a rather short temper and is not entirely too fond of Arcueid or Ciel.",
