  "description" : "A beautiful German jewel summoner and bounty hunter who specialise in demons. Her entire family was wiped out by a \"hornless demon\" leaving only herself and her older sister Florette (AKA Fiore) alive. She was then raised by her kind butler Steiner, who still remains by her side. She is now on the search for her sister, who was taken from the massacre by the demon. At first she feels uncomfortable around Rosette and the others due to their trust with Chrono, a hornless devil she thought was responsible for her suffering. This changed after spending time with them, she recognizes them as friends and worthy comrades in battle. In the Manga, she is significantly friendlier with the others, and even flirts around with Chrono, much to the annoyance of Rosette.\nAlthough highly irritated at Azmaria for her clumsy ways, Satella truly cares as she sees a part of her former self in her when she was younger. After hearing Azmaria`s soprano voice, she is proud of the young apostle and states that there are good point to her after all. Satella firmly believes that to move forward and grow, one must identify weaknesses first.\nAlthough never stated, Satella`s connections with demons may run deeper than she thought. In Fiore`s memories, Aion came to their home to enlist the help of their father who the antagonist states was their elder and teacher. With his refusal, the family home was razed and the family killed. From this it is possible to assume that both Satella and Fiore may be part demon.\nHer ending is changed significantly between the anime and the manga.\nSource: Wiki",
