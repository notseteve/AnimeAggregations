  "description" : "A-ou is an S-class ES-Member working for the GOTT. His partner is Un-ou and he has the special ability \"Amplifier\".\nBeing older and more stoic than his partner, A-ou has a stronger sense of honor and justice. He is also more of a pacifist and he often speaks in a profound and meaningful manner, giving him a rather preachy presence among other people. He and Un-ou have had a long and eventful past together during their days as mercenaries. However, despite their differences, the two have forged a strong bond as a team. His \"Amplifier\" ability allows him to improve his visual perception tenfold, as well as to see the light of people`s lives and how that dims when they die. He also uses the energy seen by Un-ou to increase the power of his physical attacks.",
