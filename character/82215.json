  "description" : "The Berlin was the Imperial flagship of the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League]`s fleet under Duke http://anidb.net/ch261 [Otto von Braunschweig].\nIt stayed at the rear of the Lippstadt fleets when they sortied out of http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersberg Fortress] in an ill-fated attempt to defeat the forces of http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], during the Imperial Civil War in 797 UC. Drawn into a trap, Braunschweig beat a hasty retreat to the fortress, and the Berlin`s shield ships were lost in the process. The Berlin remained under fire and took damage to its rear port hull, before it was rescued by the fleet of High Admiral Merkatz. (LOGH: `Courage and Loyalty`)\nWith the Lippstadt League`s fleet much reduced by the fiasco, and defeat inevitable, Duke Braunschweig sortied the remains of his fleet again soon after, in an attempt to kill Marquis Lohengramm and save the situation. The attack failed, and the Berlin retreated to the fortress once more. The Berlin was presumably captured when Lohengramm`s forces seized the fortress immediately after the battle.\nIt is apparently identical to the http://anidb.net/ch82216 [Wilhelmina] and http://anidb.net/ch1754 [Ostmark] in design. Like the Ostmark, in battle is accompanied by two shield ships which travel in close proximity to the port and starboard side. The Berlin has more than one \"set\" of these, as it sortied with replacements after its first set of shield ships were destroyed.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
