  "description" : "Loud, blustering and generally ineffective, 17-year-old Lucson is the self-proclaimed captain of the Ryvius and leader of the Zwei (titles recognised only by Lucson, as the rest of the crew have other people in those positions). In the Zwei for training for entry to the National Defence Academy, Lucson has his family honour and pride to live up to; his father and three brothers are already in the service. This pompous boy`s complete lack of leadership skills is obvious to everyone, that is, except Lucson himself.",
