  "description" : "The Varauta Large Battleship serves as heavy combat warship and command vessel in the Varauta forces. Featuring a large forward launching port for variable fighters and numerous heavy weapons, the Large Battleship is well suited to an assault role in ship-to-ship combat. The Large Battleship is also utilized as a command craft for small-to-medium scale Varauta fleets. During the Protodeviln War in the mid 2040`s, Gigile commanded a blue and white colored Large Battleship which lead a fleet of 18 other Varauta ships. This fleet was typically the primary aggressor against the UN Spacy during the early part of the war. Gigile himself would launch from his Large Battleship piloting an Fz-109F Elgerzorene variable fighter to engage in direct combat against the forces of the 37 th Long-Distance Colonization Fleet lead by the Macross 7.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/varauta-largebattleship.htm",
