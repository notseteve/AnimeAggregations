  "description" : "Following Space War I the significant number of Zentradi survivors became a driving force within the new United Nations Government. Since the UN Spacy fleet was almost completely destroyed after Space War I, the 100 remaining Zentradi spaceships of the Adoclass fleet became the bulk of the UNG`s space fleet forces and http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai]`s command ship became the first battleship of the new UN Forces. The Zentradi, long familiar with using their own technology but lacking technical skills, were taught to understand and create technology of their own as they became assimilated into human culture. Zentradi OverTechnology remained common throughout the UNG colonies even decades later and it became standard practice for many Zentradi to create their own variants of existing UNG variable fighter and ship designs. In the 2030s, the Zentradi built Stealth Frigates with variations specific to Zentradi crews. The ships featured the recognizable green colors common to older Zentradi spaceships and the smooth, organic style became pronounced in all Zentradi variant hull designs. The Frigate retained a stealth composition in the Zentradi variant and was built with Zentradi engines, fold drives and gravity control systems. Many of these Zentradi Stealth Frigates served in the ill-fated Macross 5 fleet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/stealthfrigate-zentradi.htm",
