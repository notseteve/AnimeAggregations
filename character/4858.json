  "description" : "The school`s #1 idol as the student council president, but she gets some unwelcome competition when Ayumi transfers in. She met Haruo when she was a little girl, and instantly fell in love.Yuri is still in love with Haruo, hence her constant indecent daydreaming about him, and gets irrationally angry when Ayumi is with him. As an excuse to see him she often says that Ayumi`s behaviour is \"Against School Policy\" and as the Student President she must see that all rules are followed. Most of the girls in school seem to be in love with her, student council vice-president Umi Fujiwara in particular, so her name is likely a reference to the yuri genre.",
