  "description" : "The Galactic Empire Legitimate Government was a government-in-exile formed on Heinessen in August 798 UC, after the Imperial Civil War, with the goal of opposing http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]`s rule in the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] and restoring the power of the Goldenbaum Dynasty. It was led by Prime Minister http://anidb.net/ch768 [Jochen von Remscheid], the former Imperial high commissioner on http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan], and also had the young Emperor http://anidb.net/ch225 [Erwin Josef II] as the source of their self-proclaimed legitimacy. Their regime consisted of many former http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League] supporters and other aristocrats. The government`s existence became the casus belli for Reinhard von Lohengramm to declare war on the Alliance and defeat it during Operation Ragnar√∂k, at which point the exiled court was dissolved.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
