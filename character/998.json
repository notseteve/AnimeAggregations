  "description" : "Cacnea prefers to live in harsh, arid locations, such as deserts. Cacnea live in or right next to bushes that are in the desert. The more arid and harsh the environment, the more pretty and fragrant type of flower a Cacnea can grow. It can survive for 30 days on water stored in its body. Cacnea releases a strong aroma from its flower to attract prey. When prey comes near, Cacnea shoots sharp thorns from its body to bring the victim down. This Pokémon battles by wildly swinging its thorny arms.\nIn the anime, the most notable Cacnea is James`s. He obtained it in the very episode in which his Weezing, along with Jessie`s Arbok, was released. Cacnea is rather fond of James . However, when it attempts to express his fondness of James through hugging him, his numerous spikes injure James. Cacnea is the replacement in his party, for his former grass type Pokémon, Victreebel. Jessie sometimes uses Cacnea in Pokémon Contests, but often falls victim to its spikes, ala James. James`s Cacnea was recently given to Gardenia, who felt Cacnea wasn`t living up to its full potential.",
