  "description" : "Kida Masaomi is a resident of Ikebukuro and http://anidb.net/ch12150 [Ryuugamine Mikado]`s best friend from childhood. He was the one who encouraged Mikado to come to Ikebukuro. He is enthusiastic about picking-up girls, but he seems to fail at it. He was depressed and lonely before Mikado arrived because his girlfriend was kidnapped and injured during a gang war between the http://anidb.net/ch14887 [Blue Squares] and http://anidb.net/ch14865 [Yellow Scarves], which he led at the time. After http://anidb.net/ch12155 [Anri] is injured during the Slasher incidents and the rising presence of the http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars], he is forced to become the leader of the Yellow Scarves once more. He despises http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Orihara Izaya] for manipulating him when he first formed the Yellow Scarves, but returns to him again for information about the leader of the Dollars and discovers it is Mikado. He leaves Ikebukuro with his ex-girlfriend, http://anidb.net/ch14873 [Mikajima Saki], during the conflict between the 3 main forces in Ikebukuro. Masaomi has commented on not letting Mikado \"go to the dark side,\" claiming that he has already gone through it.\nHis online chat screenname is \"Bakyura\"",
