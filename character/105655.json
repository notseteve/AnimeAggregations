  "description" : "Noin is a demon who disguises himself as history teacher Hijiri Shikaido at Maron`s school. He is a \"friend\" of Maron`s father. He has the ability to know where and who are possessed by a demon.\nFive hundred years ago, he was a French knight who assisted the original Jeanne d`Arc and was in love with her. They became lovers. Jeanne`s power to seal demons and save the world can only be done by a pure virgin. He hated Kami so much since he can`t touch her and inevitably attracted demons. Unable to protect Jeanne d`Arc from death, he gave his soul to Maou, and vowed to fall in love with Jeanne`s reincarnated form. His human heart, which was possessed by a demon, evolves into a stronger demon and can`t die. He was asked by Maou to separate Jeanne`s and Sinbad`s relationship and in return, transform into a human. After he confirms Maron is Jeanne`s reincarnation, he does fall in love with her and tries to interfere with her collecting, culminating in his attempting to strangle her as she can`t transform.\nWhen Maron travels back in time to meet Jeanne d`Arc during her final hours in chapter 22, Noin goes with her and regrets what he had done. He remembers who had him possess his past self in chapter 24. His future self had a demon possess his past self. He let it repeat during the time travel because he wants to meet Maron. In the anime adaptation, he dies protecting Maron, and is reunited with Jeanne d`Arc.",
