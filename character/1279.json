  "description" : "Darkrai, known as the Pitch-Black Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon resembling a dark, sinister ghost, such as the Grim Reaper. Darkrai is a living nightmare, or a manifestation of many nightmares. Darkrai is made by necromancy and pitch-black magic. The top of its body is connected to the lower half by a tiny waist, giving it a figure shaped like an hourglass. A white substance flows from its head, obscuring much of its facial features. Its club-shaped arms have three claws each, with parts of them appearing tattered. It`s shoulders also have long tatters as well. Darkrai possesses the power to lure people into deep sleeps and show them frightning nightmares, which sometimes make it impossible to wake up. Darkrai resides on Newmoon Island, (Mirror-image of fullmoon island in which Cresselia resides) and on nights of the new moon; when it is active, it shows horrible nightmares.\nDarkrai was released on July 19th, 2007 in Japan with the movie Dialga vs. Palkia vs. Darkrai, and it was released in the United States in Toys R` Us stores shortly after the showing of the English adaptation, The Rise of Darkrai. In the anime, it was featured in the movie Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai, in which it stops Palkia and Dialga from destroying Alamos Town. He was voiced by Bill Rogers in the film.\nIt is the only Dark-type legendary Pokémon to date, unless Arceus is holding the Dread Plate. Its signature move, \"Dark Void\", attempts to put all opponents to sleep. Coupled with excellent offenses, Darkrai is not permitted in standard battling.",
