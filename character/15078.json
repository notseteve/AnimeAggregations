  "description" : "In October A.W. 0015, the 8th Space War began between the New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. The crew of the former Vulture landship Freeden wanted to intervene and end the conflict, but they needed a way to get off the Earth first. That way presented itself at a New Orleans military base controlled by anti-New UNE opposition forces. The Freeden crew stole a battleship from the New Orleans base, which they named Freeden II. After reaching space, the Freeden II was caught in the middle of the fighting between the New UNE and the SRA, but it broke a path through the battlefield to reach the Moon where D.O.M.E., and the ultimate secret of Newtypes, lay.",
