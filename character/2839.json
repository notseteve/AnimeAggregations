  "description" : "The seventeen-year-old protagonist. He is a second-year student at Naginomori Gakuen High School. He always carries a pendant in the shape of a feather, which is a memento of his father. After his parents and little sister died, he and his brothers were under the care of their relatives in Tokyo, and ten years later they returned to their home town Ayanagi. As the series goes on, nearly everyone close to Shin seems to be taken away either by Ayane or through Death (e.g. both brothers and Kanaru respectively). Shin also has an interest in art, making clay models and is frequently seen sketching. Strangely, his art pieces resemble Personas and in one case, Igor. In the first episode, he awakens his own Persona after ten year of slumbering, and one of the enigmatic Outsiders (rogue Persona users) also commented that Shin`s Persona is of \"Special A-Level\".",
