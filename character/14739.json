  "description" : "Makihatayama Hana was a baby born from the Witch Queen Rose, a large blue flower in the Witch Queen Garden that produces a new baby every 100 years as successor to the throne. Hana is given to Doremi to be cared for after she stumbles across her. In Ojamajo Doremi DOKKAAN, she transforms herself into an 11-year-old so she could attend school with her \"mothers\" and takes on the name of Hana Makihatayama. Of all her \"mothers\", Doremi`s personality is more apparent in her. Hana returns to the Witch World with Majo Rika and the fairies in the end.",
