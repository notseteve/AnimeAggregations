His life changed completely when he met Dugtrio and no one is more surprised by his chances than Leo himself.\nOne day Leo got lost in the woods and he heard voices in the distance. He followed the voices and saw Dugtrio and he thought it was as if the very blessings of the land were singing. They became friends and started doing music together and then Dugleo was born as a result.",
