  "description" : "A friend of Judau Ashta from their junk dealer days at the space colony Shangri-La, Elle Vianno becomes the pilot of the Gundam MK.II boarding the Argama. While at first only a novice pilot, her undaunted determination eventually makes her one of the Argama`s finest. Although she has no political ideals, her allegiance to her comrades is undying. She is constantly fighting with Roux Louka for Judau Ashta`s affections, but is ultimately drawn to Beecha Oleg, and returns his feelings before the final confrontation.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
