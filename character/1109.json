  "description" : "Staravia live in enormous flocks like its pre-evolution, Starly. While in the flocks, it constantly searches fields and forests for bug Pokémon. Flocks often fight when confronted with each other.\nStaravia resembles a White-cheeked Starling. Its most prominent feature is the curled crest on its head, similar to that of a lapwing. It has a black and orange colored beak like a quail. The name Staravia derives from the English words starling and avian. Staravia`s Japanese name, Mukubird, is a portmanteau of the Japanese word for White-cheeked Starling (椋鳥, mukudori) and the English word bird.\nIn the anime, Ash`s Starly evolved into Staravia, and is frequently used in battles with Ash.",
