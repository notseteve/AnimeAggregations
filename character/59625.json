  "description" : "A high school student, started working as the assistant of Mikami at the age of 15. He is totally enthralled by Mikami, and often tells himself that he only keeps his dangerous job because of Mikami`s charm. His official wages per hour are 250 yen, later increased to 255 yen. He appears at first to have dormant spiritual abilities and later on in the manga, with the help of Shoryuki, Yokoshima does gain various abilities of his own. He also gains the unique ability of creating balls from spiritual energy called Monju, being the only one in the world with this power. He is perverted beyond belief acting thus towards almost all the women, but the only girls who show any hint of liking him are not human (except perhaps Mikami and Kobato).\nSource: Wiki",
