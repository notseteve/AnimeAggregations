  "description" : "Ginias is a brilliant scientist, charged by Sovereign Degwin Zabi himself with a top-secret weapons development project. At a hidden base on the Tibetan plateau, Ginias works frantically on the Apsalus, a powerful new mobile armor which may yet tilt the balance of the war in Zeon`s favor. As his dedication turns into obsession, Ginias comes to see everything else - his allies, his underlings, even the love of his own sister - as expendable in his desperate effort to complete his masterpiece.",
