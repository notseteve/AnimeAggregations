He is a self-confessed pervert, lolicon, and masochist who enjoys being punished by his teacher, Tsukuyomi. He is always seen with Motoharu. He, Motoharu, and Touma are known as the three idiots in their class as not only do they have the lowest test scores, but they are also Level 0s (except the latter two have good reasons for being that way).",
