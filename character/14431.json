That is until the day he meets a fortune teller who informs him that he will have a fateful encounter and adds a spell to his cell phone that allows his guardian angels to appear to him. Goru does not believe her and walks away as he remembers all of his previous times of bad luck with women.\nIt is then seen that he meets three girls who are waiting for him as he is bathing. They say they are now his Guardian Angels, sent to Earth from the spirit realm by the Goddess. They are the first three of his twelve beloved pets who had died due to Gorou`s poor luck, returning to him on earth. Soon after more and more of his former pets return to him as guardian angels, and each desires to be seen as number one in his heart, as his favorite pet.",
