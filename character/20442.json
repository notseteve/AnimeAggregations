  "description" : "A \"disused\" Sekirei wirh the Sekirei mark appearing on her forehead instead of her back, with Homura referring to her as \"Scrap Number\". She is possibly a spontaneously-winged Sekirei, and so she can`t be winged by an Ashikabi or use the Norito (it is useless from the MBI`s point of view). Akitsu`s power is very strong, allowing her to fight on par with Sekirei like Homura, whom she have encountered 3 times so far. Despite the fact that she can`t be winged, she considers Mikogami her Ashikabi because he took her in and she fears being thrown away again. She appears to be forgetful; at one point it was noticed she didn`t wear any panties. It was first assumed she was ordered to do so by Hayato, but then she revealed it was simply because she forgot to put them on. Like her power, Akitsu has a very cold and melancholic personality. It is possible that she is the former #07 because of her power and because it was the only number not used from the first dozen. Her name means \"Autumn Port\".",
