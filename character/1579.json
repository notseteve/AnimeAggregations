  "description" : "The most radical of the anti-Coordinator activist groups formed by resentful Naturals. According to the Blue Cosmos ideology, genetic modification is a violation of the natural order, and all Coordinators must be exterminated \"for the preservation of our blue and pure world.\"\nBlue Cosmos was originally an environmental pressure group, but after the revelation of George Glenn`s secret in C.E. 15, the organization launched a campaign of terror and assassination against Coordinators and the medical professionals who were working to create them. It is believed that the group is supported by the Azrael Conglomerate, a powerful industrial concern which is one of the Atlantic Federation`s major military contractors.\nAfter the first war between Earth and the PLANTs, Lord Djibril becomes the new leader of Blue Cosmos, and the organization continues to create conflict between Naturals and Coordinators.",
