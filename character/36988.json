  "description" : "The Kotoko-series support android by the same name is nearly always by Lyar`s side, both literally and figuratively. Appearing as a ten year old girl, she fits the role with her childlike excitement, but is nevertheless shown to be extremely capable of both flying her R.A. and handling a minigun. Her main fault is that her loyalty only extends as far as her programming, a weakness exploited by Bernard when Kotoko is reprogrammed to shoot anyone attempting to pursue him. She and Lyar seem to have a sort of older sister/younger sister relationship, and Lyar is often the one who updates Kotoko`s programming when the need arises.",
