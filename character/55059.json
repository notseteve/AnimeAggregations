  "description" : "Badgis is a friend of Vannessa Rene, and an expert computer technician - in other words, a hacker. He has unlimited access to a super-computer he and his students built for scientific purposes. He lends a hand in Vanessa`s search for evidence of Bookwald`s involvement with the Gazth-Sonikan war. Using his machine, the two of them slice into the Bookwald mainframe and retrieve the necessary data; however, Friday Monday intercepts their attack and Badgis is forced to shut down his system. What happened to him afterwards is unknown. Apparently, Badgis has some romantic interest in Vanessa.",
