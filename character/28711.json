  "description" : "Shinobu may have the same family name as Hikaru, but they have no relation; in fact, both dislike the other. Shinobu hails from a wealthy family and is a genius in sports. He is popular with the girls, but simultaneously arrogant and selfish. Despite his contempt towards her during their first encounter, Shinobu quickly falls for Chihiro, although he knows she is hopelessly attached to Hikaru. He continues to pursue her in hopes of helping her move on from him. After hearing Hikaru`s sacrifice for Chihiro, he decided to become a professional basketball player for her sake as well.\nDuring their last year of junior high school, Shinobu decides to attend Kaijou High School and invites Chihiro to apply with him. However, Chihiro`s decision to stay with Hikaru hurts him emotionally. At age 17, Shinobu remains just as popular with the girls as ever, but has become a playboy. He still has not forgiven Chihiro for betraying him, although he still holds feelings for her.",
