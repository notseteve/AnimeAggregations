  "description" : "Swoobat, known as the Courting Pokémon, evolves from Woobat by leveling it up when its happiness is high. Happiness can be raised by fighting through many Pokémon battles, having the Pokémon in your party or feeding it vitamins. Swoobat is a blue bat-like Pokémon with a white mane of fur, a heart shaped nose, and a vaguely heart shape at the end of its tail. The sound waves it emits from its nose are of a frequency powerful enough to destroy rocks. The ultrasonic waves emitted by a courting male causes people to have a positive mood.",
