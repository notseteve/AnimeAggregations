  "description" : "Professor Cerise showed Goh the Sinnoh region`s Resort Area and told him there was a giant Pokémon in that lake. Nobody knew what Pokémon it was but there were eyewitness reports telling of a gigantic shadow located within the lake. Goh immediately went to try to catch it. While going to get a fishing rod and lures, he encountered James in disguise who suggested a rod and an Octillery lure.\nThroughout the day, he kept catching Magikarp and Goldeen and letting them go until he tried to use the Octillery lure. Having a hard time reeling it in, everyone nearby came to help Goh until they finally beached a Giant Magikarp. Goh`s Oddish used Sleep Powder and he was able to catch the Giant Magikarp.\n-- Tenth annual Magikarp high jump competition --\nAfter being shown a video of Kasukarp and his Magikarp, it got fired up and trained for the competition. Magikarpenter`s Magikarp competed in the tenth annual Magikarp high jump competition against Goh`s Giant Magikarp. In the semi-final round, it jumped 19.98 metres but lost out to Goh`s Giant Magikarp as it jumped 21.02 metres. In the finals, it was revealed it was wearing heavy metal fins most of the competition but it took those off. It took off so far that it looked like a rocket and managed to go all the way into orbit. Because it didn`t return to the field which was necessary for the successful completion of a jump, the judges ruled that Kasukarp`s Magikarp (Shinegoldie) was the winner.",
