  "description" : "Claydol is known as the \"Clay Doll Pokemon\". It is imbued with a high degree of telekinetic power. It is always using telekinesis to keep itself afloat above the surface of the ground, whether it is traveling, standing still, or even sleeping. Its screw-shaped arms are separate objects that are connected to its body through telekinesis, and they float around Claydol`s body on Claydol`s accord. In battle, it positions its arms out in front and shoots lateral beams at its targets. The species originates from a doll or a statue made of mud and clay by primitive humans, of an ancient civilization dating back around 20,000 years, and then was brought to life by exposure under a mysterious ray. Some believe it can control the elements. In the Hoenn region video games, they can be found in the Sky Tower.",
