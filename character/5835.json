  "description" : "A nationally renowned high school baseball coach, having taken teams to Koushien several times, winning it twice. He is hired by Interim Principal Shidou, replacing Coach Maeno in the process, to build up Seishuus baseball team. He recruits his own players from around the country, including Azuma and Miki, to create a first-string team, relegating the existing baseball club to a second-string squad called the prefab or farm teamâ€”which he calls a \"cesspool\". He is depicted as proud and rigid: Senda tells the rest of the prefab team there is no chance of being promoted back to first-string, because that would require Daimon to admit he made a mistake, and Miki is demoted to the bench for disobeying a direct order to make a play. Akaishi criticizes Daimon for using up players in order to win, noting that despite his career record, none of his former players have succeeded as pros. During the rematch scrimmage with the prefab team, Daimon refuses to acknowledge that Kou has become a better pitcher, that his team needs Miki, or that he must change his set coaching strategy. After losing the scrimmage, Daimon is forced to resign along with Shidou. He then becomes head coach for Kurokoma Jitsugyou, employing the same talent-buying strategy he used in Seishuu, where he loses in the first round of the regional tournament because he refuses to take Miki`s team seriously.",
