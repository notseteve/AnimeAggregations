  "description" : "Melk is the most famous knife sharpener in the world. He was previously known as the \"Demon Gourmet\" for his great strength and intimidating appearance. Living and working as a hermit atop his mountain, Melk raised an orphaned girl as his daughter and apprentice, who later took on the mantle of Melk the Second. It`s believed he is shy and silent, but in reality his voice is so tiny, that most people can`t hear him and he thinks he gets ignored.",
