  "description" : "Himenohara Suzuran is an airheaded and shy classmate of http://anidb.net/ch19271 [Akina], http://anidb.net/ch21010 [Haruomi], and http://anidb.net/ch21727 [Midori]`s. She fell in love with Haruomi at first sight, and her shyness motivates her to stalk him. She is quite innocent and childlike, but she has a high libido. Suzuran rarely speaks, but when she does, she uses floriography. Since she and Midori has been best friends for a long time, only Midori can understand Suzuran without difficulty.\nSource: VNDB",
