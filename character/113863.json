  "description" : "Hauser von Steiermark was an Imperial flag officer that had participated in the Second Battle of Tiamat.\nSteiermark was arguably the most competent and certainly the most successful admiral on the Imperial side during the Second Battle of Tiamat but was unable to prevent the battle from turning into a major Imperial defeat. As the Alliance`s forces finally shattered and routed the Imperial forces, Steiermark`s fleet remained and served as a solid rear guard, covering the retreat of the remaining Imperial forces.\nHe then sent a message of condolence to the Alliance regarding Bruce Ashbey`s death, an act which was condemned by the admiralty but it did not slow his advancement because of his obvious competence. Seven years after the battle, when he was questioned during the investigation of the death of Christopf von Michaelsen, he was observed to be holding the rank of a full admiral.\nGineipedia",
