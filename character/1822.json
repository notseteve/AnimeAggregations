  "description" : "For most of the third arc, Nia serves as the messenger from the Anti-Spirals to the humans, during the Earth`s Human Extermination System.\nAfter the Anti-Spiral data awakens within her and converts her into an Anti-Spiral virtual lifeform, becoming an emotionless and serious person, the exact opposite of how Nia was beforehand. As the messenger, she wears a dark skin-tight suit, covered with a green line pattern resembling something like a circuit board, and the previously red irises of her eyes have become black.\nAfter becoming a messenger on the birth of the 1 millionth human, she possesses the power to travel between spatial dimensions, jump between positions instantly and intercept most methods of communication. She appears before Simon several times over the course of the arc, to repeatly tell him that all efforts against the Human Extermination System is futile while increasing the odds against mankind. But it was when she is the only thing keeping the Gurren Lagann from the \"moon\"`s control system, Simon points out to her that all her actions and appearances before him were in fact the act of her true feelings of her former self, who urges Simon to keep fighting, allowing Nia to have the strength to return to her former self while ending the Human Extermination. However, she is transported back to the Anti-Spiral homeworld so the data on Team Dai Gurren can be extracted from her for analysis, resulting in the rescue attempt that begins the fourth and final arc.",
