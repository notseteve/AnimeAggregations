  "description" : "Elesa`s Tynamo was the last Pokémon that she used in her gym battle against Ash. It was matched up against Pikachu who had just defeated her Emonga. Elesa`s Tynamo nickname is \"Electric Queen\" (エレクトリッククイーン) as Elesa believes it is one of her most powerful Pokémon. It`s main attack is a very fast Tackle which is used multiple times to do significant damage. Pikachu had a hard time defending against the fast Tackle attack but it used its Thunderbolt to create a large dust cloud leaving only a small corridor for Pikachu to focus on it and so Elesa`s Tynamo couldn`t maneuver out of the way. Pikachu one hit K.O`d Elesa`s Tynamo with a Iron Tail. The loss gave Ash the overall victory.",
