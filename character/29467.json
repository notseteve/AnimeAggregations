  "description" : "Sahara is Kaiji`s younger co-worker at a convenience store he found employment at following his survival of Espoir. Sahara dreams of finding his big break in life, and like Kaiji feels he is getting nowhere with his dead-end job. He begs Endou to permit him to participate in the Human Derby, despite warnings from Kaiji. Sahara`s youthful strength and impulsiveness benefit him greatly in the gamble, and he gets a strong lead on the other racers, earning first place in Kaiji`s block and receiving a certificate redeemable for 20,000,000Â¥. In the second leg of the race, Sahara is the first to reach the other side of the second bridge - however, before he can cash his earnings from the Starside Hotel, he falls into a trap set up by Hyoudou Kazutaka and is killed.",
