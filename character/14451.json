  "description" : "Ken`s pet robot dog. Peach was also affected by a white light, gaining the ability to talk, as well as a considerable boost in intelligence. Peach`s shout prompts the girls to transform either in person or through a long-distance communication device, although a modification to the girls` compacts allows them to transform on their own. Additionally, Peach can re-summon the girls` powers, even when their powers are drained. Peach is also capable of sniffing out those who are affected by the black lights, white lights, and Him`s black particles. The black light monsters/villains that have been sniffed by Peach are stored in his data banks for later reference. This ability, however, is hindered if his target is wearing heavy cosmetics (as was the case with Sedusa). Peach is also capable of sniffing and identifying others more clearly than other dogs, even when someone`s appearance has been completely changed. Peach`s phrases always end with a bark (or \"wan,\" literally his bark). He is also able to understand cats. It is possible Peach is based after \"The Talking Dog\" as well as the Powerpuff Hotline. Like many recurring characters, he was given his own symbol, a Bone. In episode 37, when the Powerpuff Girls Z are \"grounded\" from using their powers for a day when they have to take a test in school, Peach fills in for them, wearing a skintight brown jumpsuit with black trim, and brandishing a nunchaku made of two bones linked together, and calling himself \"Peach Z\". He assists Ken in dealing with the Gangreen Gang, making short work of them with his nunchaku.",
