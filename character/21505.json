  "description" : "Nakagawa Kanon is currently the most popular \"traditional idol\" for her quaint style, beauty and singing talents. She is also in Keima`s homeroom but had not been attending frequently because of her idol occupation. Kanon hopes that her song would \"resound in everyone`s hearts.\" She is constantly anxious and dependent about the acknowledgment of her existence by others. When she feels ignored the spirit possessing her causes her body to appear transparent to others. Her lack of confidence is so great that when Keima first met her and didn`t recognize her she buzzed him with a pair of stun guns that she carries. On the night of her premiere performance as an idol she was overcome with stage fright, (becoming nearly invisible) until Keima encouraged her to believe in herself, filling the gap in her heart. During the performance afterwards Kanon began to glow so brightly that it was hard to see her. Keima commented on this, saying that she was no longer and `idol` but a `star`. In Kanon`s 4-box comic strips, it shows that there are leftover feelings for Keima; it`s shown that she trips when saying `kiss`, and when she sees something or someone related to Keima`s name (Exa: the wig is called a katsura in japanese).\nShe debuted as side member of a trio unit \"Citron\", became center after took off her glasses and started solo after she cut her hair. She does not use the glasses when she performs as an idol, but wears it in school and private. Raises a turtle named Kintarou as a pet.\nThe cause of Kanon`s crevice in the heart was her doubt of her existance as an idol.\nHer name comes from Ise-Nakagawa Station (伊勢中川駅, Ise-Nakagawa-eki).",
