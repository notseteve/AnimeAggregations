  "description" : "Fungo is a refugee welcomed into the Comodeen. In his first appearance, he steals and eats Ai`s backpack, leading them to the Comodeen`s base when caught. As the group set off in Cid`s submarine to catch up to the interdimensional train, he steals Yuu`s backpack with intent to eat it. Seemingly not good for anything, it is revealed that he does have one special ability: the good news is that Fungo can sense danger before it happens; the bad news is that Fungo can only sense danger seconds before it happens. It is revealed in Cactus: The Wandering Sea that he can understand Cactuars.",
