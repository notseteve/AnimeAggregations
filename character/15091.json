  "description" : "Shizuo`s brother.\nNowadays a famous actor and model under the name Hanejima Yuuhei (羽島 幽平), he was scouted in place of his brother when he saved the talent scout from one of his outbursts of anger. After some modeling and his debut as lead actor in the film Vampire Ninja Kaamira Saizou he gained slowly popularity over the net because of his acting abilities. After an appearance in the popular show Money Gamer, where he made 1.2 billion Yen through money investments within a month, his name appeared nationwide on news reports prompting his stardom followed by a number of leading cast appearances in TV drama.\nAlthough a star excelling with a broad range of acting skills, once he is not in front of a camera it is as though he would lose any emotion and revert to a roboter-like state. But it is exactly this very nature of him, which makes him an idol amongst his many fans, who love his \"cool expression\".",
