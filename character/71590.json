  "description" : "The Sleeping Knights was a small guild of players who had tried various virtual reality games. The last game they have tried was New ALfheim Online, where they decided to defeat a Floor Boss and have their names engraved on the Monument of Swordsmen.\nIn reality, all members of the guild were terminally ill patients who met on a virtual hospice named Serene Garden. Originally, there were nine members in the guild and it was led by Ran, the sister of the second leader Yuuki.\nTogether, they began traveling through various different virtual worlds and had undergone numerous adventures. However, by the start of Mother`s Rosario, 3 members: Ran, Clovis and Merida, died and 2 more members were declared to not last past Spring, thus the members of the Sleeping Knights decided to find the most joyful, most beautiful and most exciting virtual world and work together to accomplish something grand in the world to permanently leave their mark on it before disbanding once another member disappeared.\nEventually, they came across ALfheim Online and decided to leave their mark on this world by defeating a Floor Boss with just 1 party to leave all of their names on the Monument of Swordsmen.\nSource: wikia",
