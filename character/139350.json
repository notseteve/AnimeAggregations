  "description" : "Presumably either Cinder Fall or Neopolitan, but never confirmed as her face, name, and voice was not shown. As she never appears again, it is unknown if this getaway driver is the same person as Cinder Fall from the original web cartoon, Neo in disguise, or just someone else entirely. Nevertheless, she makes a brief cameo at the first episode, where she helps Roman Torchwick escape from Glynda Goodwitch and Ruby Rose.",
