For her debut, Madoka sang the song Eternal Snow by Route:L, choosing the song she overheard that Full Moon wanted to sing as well. She hoped that she if she sang it first, the producer would not let Full Moon sing it. Eventually both Full Moon and Madoka had a single produced under the title Eternal Snow. However, there are some differences in the song. Madoka`s version of Eternal Snow is Diamond Dust Remix.\nNear the end of the anime, Madoka performs her version of Eternal Snow in Full Moon`s Final Live Concert",
