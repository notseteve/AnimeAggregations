  "description" : "Mikura, Kurokawa, and Harada are the 3 members of the Danger Service Agency (DSA). Mikura is the brawn of the group, Harada is the brains, and Kurokawa is just a bitter ex-cop who likes to think he`s in charge. They`ll take on any job as long as it involves lots of danger and, of course, money. If you want to live long enough to eat dinner, you better not cross them.",
