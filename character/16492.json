  "description" : "Niimai Takashi is http://anidb.net/ch16491 [Youta]`s best friend; as such he is aware of Youta`s feelings for http://anidb.net/ch16493 [Moemi] and hesitates accepting Moemi`s love for him as he doesn`t want Youta to suffer. He plays the double bass in a band with friends at school, is dark, tall and handsome, and thus the heartthrob at school whom many girls are pining for (even though he never treated any girl kindly and rejected all their presents).",
