  "description" : "Limone is the father of Clemont and Bonnie. He lives in Lumiose City where he runs an electric appliance store in this city together with Denryu. He seems to know a lot about electric devices and Electric Pok√©mon.\nHe`s told Clemont many times that being strict to challengers as a Gym Leader is fine but strictness alone won`t make them become good Trainers. He`s told his son that as the Gym Leader of the Lumiose City Gym, he is the pride of their city.\nInitially, little was known about this masked person that dresses up like Burshamo, but he does try to help the citizens of Lumiose City. Blaziken Mask tries to keep his identity unknown to the general population and often goes out at night like a super hero to help our around the city.",
