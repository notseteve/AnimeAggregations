  "description" : "Bis is a Demon Card minion under the command of Lance`s squadron. He is an obese man with a green mohawk, piercing on his head and the word \"Death\" written on his forehead. While fighting Musica, he uses a giant drill machine that he wears on his arm. Later on in the series after Lance`s defeat, he is seen on a chapter cover begging to Galein Musica. He appears in Mashima`s later series Fairy Tail in a minor role as a random member of the dark guild Grimoire Heart where he is easily defeated by Pantherlily and gets his sword taken from him.",
