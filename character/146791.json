  "description" : "Hanawa Beni is a mysteriuos girl that http://anidb.net/ch126219 [Momijiyama Teru] met in the school library. She claimed to be the sole member of the Literature Club and asked Teru to help her look for the Blood-stained Book (血塗られた本 Chinurareta Hon).\nLater that day, because Beni seemingly vanished into thin air and http://anidb.net/ch133336 [Koishikawa Iko] stated that Literature Club currently has zero members, it made Teru think that she met a ghost.\nThe misunderstanding was cleared when Teru met Beni at school the next day who told her that she has forgotten that Literature Club was actually absorbed into Newspaper Club the year before.",
