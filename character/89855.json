  "description" : "Akutsu Ruri is http://anidb.net/ch89069 [Akuru]`s little sister who is in the 5th grade. She is worried she will become an idiot like http://anidb.net/ch89068 [Yoshiko] as she struggles academically, and that even her brother tells her to give up - even giving her a guidebook on how to get through life without a degree. She admires http://anidb.net/ch89070 [Sayaka] because she helps tutor her a little bit.\nSource: Wikipedia",
