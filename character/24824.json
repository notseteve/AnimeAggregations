  "description" : "Shigi is a 19 year-old ronin college student who, like Minato, wishes to enroll in Tokyo University. Kuno, his Sekirei, is much of a klutzy crybaby whose main ability is her voice, using it to either confuse their enemy or block their attacks. With her Norito, she can drain the energy from her enemies while putting them to sleep, but it seems to have a weak effect from a long distance. Shigi desires to defend her and wants to withdraw from the Game by leaving Tokyo before MBI`s soldiers could capture them, and sought Minato and Kaoru`s help to escape Tokyo, which eventually succeeded despite being a bit injured along with Kuno during an encounter with the Disciplinary Squad. Kuno`s Norito is \"The vow of my song, light the path of my Ashikabi!\"",
