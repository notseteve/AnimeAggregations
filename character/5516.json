  "description" : "Cattleya is a swordswoman who owns a weapon shop in the small town of Vosk. A former adventurer, Cattleya was known as the Giant Slayer for wielding an enormous greatsword with ease. She soon fell in love with another adventurer named Owen, who later became her husband, and together they had a son named Lana. However, their happiness was destroyed when Owen disappeared, and Cattleya enters the Queen`s Blade to find him with Lana by her side. Her combat ability is hampered by Lana constantly clinging about her knees. While many of the female characters have big breasts, Cattleya`s are exceptionally large, measuring 120 cm in circumference.\nSource: Wiki",
