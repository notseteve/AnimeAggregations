  "description" : "One of two \"agents\" from the Magic Academy sent with a report about the Star Crystals` disappearance. Their true forms are unknown since they took the images drawn up by Haruna; Shichimi is a cat, and Motsu is a frog. They then stay at Mahora and keep a close eye on Negi to ensure his magic secrecy. Eventually, this may no longer be the case when all of class 3-A learn about magic and became Pactio partners. In more recent episodes, a few bizarre segments involve Motsu and Makie, where Makie refers to Motsu as \"father\". A few other strange cutscenes show them playing with tissue paper and bubblewrap. Occasionally, they are found with the Black Rose Baron.",
