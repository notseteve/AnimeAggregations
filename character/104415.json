  "description" : "Surtr is a Secondary Pallasite armed with a gem known as the Mystic Stone (ミスティックストーン Misutikku Sutōn) that enables him to produce a barrier that Cosmo cannot penetrate. He can also direct this energy into powerful attacks, magnified by several large crystals in his battle chamber within Pallasvelda. He is within one of the paths leading to Pallasvelda`s internal chambers, battling Koga, Souma, Yuna, and Shun to prevent them from reaching Pallas. Shun discovers that his ability is vulnerable to attacks from normal objects and directs Koga to deliver a blow without his Cloth to destroy the Mystic Stone, ultimately leading to Surtr`s defeat and death from Shun`s Nebula Storm.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
