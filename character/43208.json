  "description" : "Doctor Tsubaki is Sasuke Tsubaki`s foster father and the man who delivered Haru`s twins. He was also the one who caused the car accident which ultimately took Haru`s life. He works at the Tsubaki Clinic and adopted Tsubaki primarily at Haru`s behest, as she didn`t want Akane to take on a responsibility she couldn`t handle - namely, raising two babies. On the twins` seventeenth birthday, he tells Tsubaki the entire story and seeks out Bossun to do the same. He is the one who informs each of them that they have a twin.\nSource: Sket Dance Wikia",
