  "description" : "Rowena was Grings Kodai`s secretary. Goone introduced her to Grings Kodai but Grings Kodai had a vision that she would be one of the people that would betray him while attempting to capture the second ripple of time energy. Though he knew of her eventual betrayal, he did not mention it to her and allowed her to have the job as her secretary.\nRowena did `betray` Grings Kodai when she learned about the plot to use Zoroark to cause terror in Crown City. She met Karl and Ash and together they were able to stop Grings Kodai. Grings Kodai recognized his vision had come to pass when Rowena showed up at the large tree in Crown City with the others to stop him. She told him that she didn`t need to be paid for her work. Rowena was able to give Karl and Ash the insider information that would help prove that Grings Kodai was guilty for the crimes he had committed.",
