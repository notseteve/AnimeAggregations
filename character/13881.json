  "description" : "Sakasagami no Yura (Yura of the Hair) is a minor character in Inuyasha. She is the first demon to appear as a serious threat to Inuyasha.\nYura was one of the first demons to give Inuyasha and Kagome Higurashi the fight of their lives. Residing in an invisible coocoon made up entirely of hair while hiding her true form in a red comb, wich she hid in a skull, Yura manipulated the townspeople via her hair so that Inuyasha may succumb and she may obtain their Shikon shards.\nDuring their fight, while she had Inuyasha cornered, Kagome was wearing his fire rat robe, and was thus protected from her razor-sharp hair. After she found her true form, the comb hidden away in a red skull, Kagome grabbed one of her arrows and smashed it until Yura was no more.\nWhile Yura of the Hair was relatively short-lived, she had the distinct honor of being the first true tough battle for Inuyasha.\nUnlike most of the demons who appeared in the series, Yura was by far the most human-like, taking the apperance of a young girl wearing traditional kunoichi (female ninja) garb.",
