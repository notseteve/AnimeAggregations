  "description" : "Suzuki Shin`you takes the position as the Student President after Ouka is hospitalized. During LXE`s attack on Ginsei High, Suzuki uses his status to broadcast on the school public address system that both Kazuki and Tokiko (who are battling the giant homunculi) are also monsters, thereby attempting to isolate Kazuki and Tokiko. However, he is outsmarted by Rokumasu and his plans are thwarted. When Dr. Butterfly informs him that he is no longer needed and therefore dispensable (and also edible), he breaks down emotionally. According to Dr. Butterfly, he is not a homunculus but merely a familiar and therefore not worthy to possess a kakugane.",
