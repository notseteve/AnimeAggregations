  "description" : "Lotad is both an aquatic and a land-dwelling Pokémon, found in the Hoenn region, with a lilypad growing on its back. This species lives in groups at ponds, with their bodies submerged while suspended at the surface by their buoyant leaves, as a measure of hiding from predators. When on dry land, Lotad scuttles towards other ponds because its leaf is too heavy to support, in contrast to Lotad`s ancient ancestors which were one primarily land-dwelling Pokémon. Lotad and its evolved forms have mouths resembling duck bills, which may be a pun on the duckweed.\nIn the Pokémon anime, a Lotad becomes one of the Pokémon in trainer Brock`s possession in the third-generation Hoenn story arc in a development considered ironic because previously Brock primarily used Pokémon of the Rock and Ground types. His Lotad eventually evolved into Lombre, and then Ludicolo.",
