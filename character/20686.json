  "description" : "The most androgynous of the four, \"Yuki\" is gentle and is initially the most frightened of Sunako. He`s the most \"normal\" of the four boys; before coming to live at the mansion he had a normal school life with a middle-class family. His mother and the Landlady are old friends and the Landlady, and Sunako at times, has a soft spot for Yuki. He`s also the shortest and shyest, with a \"cute\" face, and has been called on (very reluctantly) to dress up as a girl on more than one occasion. He is usually responsible for choosing what sort of clothes Sunako wears when she is forced to dress up and has a good sense of fashion.",
