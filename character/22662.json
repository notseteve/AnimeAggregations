  "description" : "Ethan is in the service of several local and isolated towns on the Mandarin Island South by providing them with electricity from the number of Magnemite in his collection.\nEthan takes his Magnemite in the waste and tundra areas and when a thunderstorm appears Ethan would send the Magnemite into the sky to absorb electricity from the lightning. The Magnemite would act as batteries and provide power to the local towns.\nEthan`s Jolteon is useful as a sheepdog and rounds up any stray Magnemite using its electric abilities. Ethans travels in a stagecoach that is pulled by two Tauros.\nDuring an emergency where a nearby town was desperate for electricity for the Pok√©center, Jolteon was injured along with Ethan and they had to rely on Ash and Pikachu to deliver the Magnemite which were storing the electricity.",
