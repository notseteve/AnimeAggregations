  "description" : "Hiding from the world behind a sheet of hanging bangs, mousy bookworm Nodoka is painfully shy, especially around men. Rather than face Negi Springfield, the newest professor at Mahora Academy, Nodoka would probably prefer to vanish into the school`s vast library forever. Something is stirring in the quiet girl, though! something she cannot explain. Whatever these odd feelings, they are tied to Negi; if the lass could ever untie her tongue, perhaps a special relationship with the little magi awaits!",
