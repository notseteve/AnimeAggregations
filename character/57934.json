(However, her idea of cool is based on elementary school boys.)\nThe Demon King`s daughter. Since the Demon King was defeated, she`s become an employee-in-training at Leon in the Royal Capital. She lacks a bit of common sense, but she`s very honest, hard-working, and straightforward. She possesses vast magical power that has yet to awaken, so she can`t use magic without channeling though a magic item. However, she also lacks control and occasionally causes the magic item to go berserk. She inherited her father`s loud laughter and intimidating air of hostility, allowing her to break the spirit of thieves in an instant.\nSource: ANN",
