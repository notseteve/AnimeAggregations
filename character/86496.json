  "description" : "Alba is a beginning Pokémon Trainer in the Kalos region. He visited the Miare Gym after the events of Flare Gang and instantly recognized Ash from the Kalos League. He had watched it and though it was incredibly cool and got so fired up that he also wanted to enter the league no matter what.\nHe had visited the gym a few days earlier and lost to the Clembot and he wanted a rematch because he had been beaten to a pulp by it and he wanted to get the badge. Unfortunately, the Clembot`s memory had been erased and its battle style was basically back to a beginner as well. Despite this, Clemont agreed to let come back the next day to battle the Clembot when repairs to the gym were completed and he could do some more tweaking to Clembot.\nMotivated and pumped up to get the badge, fought with all he could and remembered what Clembot had taught him; that Pokémon have endless potential and that drawing out their strengths is a Trainer`s duty. Alba and his Pokémon believed in those words and worked hard and it paid off as they defeated the Clembot to get the Voltage Badge.",
