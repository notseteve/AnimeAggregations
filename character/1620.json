  "description" : "The Sayrune is currently commissioned as Adiane`s personal Gunman and was first seen deployed from the flagship, Dai-Gunkai, while pursuing the stolen Dai-Gunzan. It is one of the few Gunman seen thus far in the series to feature two unique configurations: its default winged humanoid appearance, as well as an alternate scorpion-shaped layout. While in its winged state, the Sayrune seems to rely mostly on a range of energy whips and tendrils to mount any sort of attack, whereas its scorpion form is endowed with massive pincer claws and a stinger. The Sayrune can also use its wings to form a double-edged weapon called the Bloody Clamper.\nThe Sayrune was destroyed, along with its pilot, when it was shot by the Dai-Gurren`s cannons at point blank range, after Adiane`s failed attempt to take Nia as a hostage.",
