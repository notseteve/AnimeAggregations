  "description" : "Octillery resembles a combination of an octopus and a tank. This is reflected in its abilities, including squirting ink as a means of self-defense. Also, like octopuses, Octillery can move about by squirting pressurized water from its mouth. Octillery is a carnivore; they catch fish with their tentacles, and kill (and afterwards eat) it by smashing the rocky protrusions on its head into its opponent`s skull. Octillery is a nesting creature, in that it sleeps in burrows it prepares; however, its nests are temporary structures only, and it rarely uses the same nest two nights in a row.",
