  "description" : "Despite being an ally of justice, Red does not come off as being heroic much of the time. He is rude and violent, as well as impatient and impulsive. In addition, he wears regular clothing even when fighting Florsheim`s monsters (generally a t-shirt and shorts). The only signs that show he is a hero is his superhuman strength and the fact he inexplicably wears his mask all the time. He is somehow even able to smoke through the mask, which covers his entire head.",
