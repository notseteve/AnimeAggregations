  "description" : "Marie is a 4 year child orphaned by the hands of Gargoyle and the Neo-Atlantean troops, who killed her parents. She is soon found by Nadia and Jean, who decide to keep her and to take good care of her. Although she is a kid, Marie is a very strong character, who is at the same time a child but also acts like an adult in difficult situations. She has a good relationship with King, her playmate. In fact, she later comes to see him as husband and wife and Nadia and Jean as her new parents. Later on, however, she will develop an interest in Sanson; in fact, in the epilogue, when a grown-up Marie tells what has happened to all the characters, she finishes her story by telling that she has married him, and is expecting their first child.\nSource: Wikipedia\nNote 1: The spelling of her name is uncertain. In the episode guide she appears as \"Marie\", in the Japanese series books she is \"Mary\", Streamline Pictures calls her \"Mari\", and in episode 24 she signs one of her drawings as \"Marry\" (though this could simply be that as a four-year-old she doesn`t know how to spell her name). Even so, Marie is probably the most accurate spelling, as it is the French one.\nNote 2: In the CD audio dramas, her full name was revealed to be \"Marie en Carlsberg\" (マリー・エン・カールスバーグ), whereas in the anime`s epilogue, it is \"Marie en Löwenbräu\" (マリー・エン・レーヴェンブロイ).",
