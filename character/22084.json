  "description" : "Bean Bandit is one tough man. Perhaps \"virtually unstoppable\" is a better way to put it. To start, his clothes provide LOTS of protection. A kevlar-titanium combination line his jacket and headband, and both are able to stop bullets. He also has kevlar is his gloves, pants, and boots.\nAs you can imagine, Bean`s very strong. He`s strong enough to tangle with the best of them either with just his bare hands or with his knife, which he can pitch with incredible speed and power.",
