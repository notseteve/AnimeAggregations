  "description" : "Ageha is Kurumu`s mother who appears during the start of the school festival under the belief that Tsukune is her daughter`s fianc√©, going so far as to allow him to \"jump\" her daughter anytime he wants. She also sports large breasts like her daughter and according to Tsukune, her breasts are softer than Kurumu`s. Exclusively in the anime`s second season, Ageha and Tsurara hold a long grudge against one another, being rivals for the affection of a student during their days as students at Youkai Academy. Due to having a long-time grudge against Tsurara, she is similar to the Meryl Streep character Madeline from the Robert Zemeckis film Death Becomes Her.",
