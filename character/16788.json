  "description" : "Shiranui Mai is a character from both the Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters series of fighting games by SNK (now SNK Playmore). In her mind, Andy Bogard, who studied Ninjutsu with her grandfather, Hanzo, is her fianc√©. The relationship between the two is often ambiguous, usually on the part of Andy, who at times seems to suppress his feelings for her in favor of treating her like a little sister. She typically wears exceptionally low-cut blouses, dresses, and clothing to maximize the exposure of her cleavage, and most fight scenes involving Mai include several shots that focus especially on her breasts and buttocks.\nHeight, weight and B-W-H sizes are from Real Bout Fatal Fury.",
