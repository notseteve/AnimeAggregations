  "description" : "Milly Thompson is a fellow Bernardelli agent, and friend and assistant to Meryl. Despite physically towering over Meryl, Milly looks up to her and always refers to her in a respectful manner. She appears rather simple, but has a kind heart and also reveals a strength of character and genuine optimism. Milly comes from a very large family, and writes huge masses of letters to them constantly (known as \"The Milly Monthly\"). Milly manages to hide a very heavy concussion gun, referred to as a \"stun-gun\", under her coat. The shots, which pop out into the shape of an X-shaped claw, are so powerful they can even knock over trucks. Although she does not have a relationship with Wolfwood in the manga, events after his death indicate that she might have had a romantic interest in him. Her reaction to Wolfwood`s loss in the anime is considerably greater compared to the manga. The manga version of Milly has blond hair whereas the anime depiction has browner-colored hair.",
