  "description" : "A new model of mass production mobile suit created as a successor to the Dagger series. Like the Dagger L, the Windam can be adapted to various combat situations using interchangeable Striker packs, allowing the Earth Alliance to maintain its numerical advantage by using the same versatile machine in every battlefield. This machine uses the same beam sabers and Stiletto weapons as its predecessor, but carries a larger beam rifle and a new type of shield. After the Phantom Pain special forces unit is transferred to Earth, its commander Neo Roanoke enters combat using a Windam painted in his distinctive personal colors.",
