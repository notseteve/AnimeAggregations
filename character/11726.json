He went out of his way to get her attention and her \"kiss\" (which he still didn`t get), and even ended up making a deal with the devil Igunisu.\nTakuruu has been Hinagiku`s close friend since childhood, but later he moved away.\nEven so, they remained pretty close. Despite the huge gap of differences between him and Hinagiku, Takuruu ended up falling in love with his childhood friend anyways.",
