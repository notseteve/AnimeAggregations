  "description" : "Anima`s name was revealed in the closed captions of the Japanese original airing as her name wasn`t said in any actual dialog in the episode. She mysteriously appears to Ash and his friends just after Alexa explained the legend of the hero Woodate. She asked if they were heading to the summit of the mountain and after they confirmed they were, she gave Ash a medal.\nShe later reappeared to tell them that what they were seeing was the Ghost Pokémon`s comet dance. The Ghost Pokémon danced like that to give praise to Hero Woodate. Alexa had recorded the whole incident but it ended up to be blank. Later, they reviewed the book to see the girl they had met the night before was standing beside Woodate who was holding that same medal.",
