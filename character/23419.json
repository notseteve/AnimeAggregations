  "description" : "Chizuru, nicknamed Chii-chan, is a tall girl who first appears as a classmate of http://anidb.net/ch21554 [Shuuichi] when they both enter junior high school. She is http://anidb.net/ch23423 [Momoko`s] childhood friend, and has a stylish demeanor, highlighted by her stature and long hair, which captivates both Shuichi and http://anidb.net/ch21555 [Yoshino] when they first meet her. Chizuru is described as a free spirit, someone who enjoys doing unconventional, often outrageous things which surprise those around her; she frequently acts without thinking, and as a result projects a childish personality. Her impulsive behavior sometimes gets her in trouble with other characters, but she quickly becomes ashamed when she realizes the consequences. She tries to be everyone`s friend, though http://anidb.net/ch23418 [Saori] strongly dislikes her impulsiveness. Chizuru joins the girl`s basketball team in junior high. Her family runs a soba restaurant.",
