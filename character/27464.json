  "description" : "Landorus is known as the Abundance Pokémon. He is based on Inari, the god of fertility. Landorus can only be encountered at a location known as the Abundant Shrine if the player has both Tornadus and Thundurus in their party (one must be traded from the other game version).\nIt bears striking resemblance to both Tornadus and Thundurus. It has the same design as both, only having a different color, hairstyle, moustache, and tail. It is bright orange with red spots, has an old European hairstyle and moustache, and has a long, brown tail with red `craters` jutting out.\nLegends say that it put an end to the mischief caused by both Tornadus and Thundurus when they were destroying the land of the Unova by causing massive thunderstorms and tornados that shred apart the ground. After banishing the mischievous Pokémon, it regrew and refertilized the land of Unova. It can be found in the Abundant Shrine area after catching both Tornadus and Thundurus. Lands visited by Landorus grant such bountful crops that it has been hailed as \"The Guardian of the Fields.\"\nLandorus gains an alternate form in the upcoming games Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 after being obtained in the side game Pokémon Dream Radar (known in Japan as Pokémon AR Searcher). Landorus`s Therian Forme resembles a tiger, and its original form is called the Incarnate Forme can be translated as Avatar or Incarnation).",
