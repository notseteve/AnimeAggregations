  "description" : "Nana Sawada is Tsunayoshi Sawada`s mother, who, despite caring deeply for him, has fairly little belief in her son succeeding in life. She does not expect him to get into a good college, has an outburst claiming that her son is a loser, is eternally grateful for Haru wanting to be his girlfriend despite how pathetic he is in her eyes, etc. She helps feed all the people that are presently living in her house and does not see anything strange with any of them. She, on the surface, seems to be unaware of the fact that both her husband and her son are part of the Mafia, though at times this is called into question.\nSource: rebornwikia",
