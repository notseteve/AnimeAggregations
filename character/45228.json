  "description" : "A technology testbed created by upgrading a surviving unit of the RX-160 Byarlant, which was developed by the Titans during the Gryps Conflict. Its thrusters have been enhanced, and propellant tanks added, to extend the time for which it can fly independently in the atmosphere. This machine has overcome the stigma of its evil origins as a Titans mobile suit, and now that people have discovered the value of its remarkable performance, it once again flies through the skies of Earth.",
