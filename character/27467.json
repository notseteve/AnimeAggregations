  "description" : "Aria Forme\nMeloetta is a small feminine humanoid Pokémon with long, green hair and is one of the few Pokémon to have alternate forms. Its default form is Aria Forme (Voice Forme), but it can also transform into Pirouette Forme (Step Forme), where its long green hair forms into a compact red beehive hairstyle and its body seems to take on more of a ballerina`s form. It changes forms whenever it uses its unique move Relic Song.\nMeloetta once played a song and danced lightly, filling people`s hearts with joy. However, sorrow darkened the world, and it lost its voice and red shoes. Upon entering a café in Castelia City, a guitarist who knows the story plays Meloetta`s melody. Upon playing it, Meloetta remembers the song it once danced to long ago, and learns Relic Song.\nMeloetta will appear in a short film that accompanies Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice in theaters, entitled Meloetta`s Sparkling Recital.\nAnother Meloetta is a main character in the Best Wishes! Season 2 anime, joining Ash, Iris, Cilan, Cynthia, and Dawn in their journeys through Eastern Unova.",
