  "description" : "Oswald is an exobiologist who makes his one and only appearance in the episode entitled \"Clefairy Tales.\" He is a strong believer in extraterrestrial life and has great interest in finding more proof to support his beliefs, as frequently demonstrated in this episode. However, he is a bit of a klutz and tends to let his interest and excitement get the best of him, as shown during his questioning of witnesses to Clefairy`s earth landing and of Clefairy`s superb technology aboard their spaceship. He ended up blasting off with the Clefairy in their spaceship and landing nearby on earth. Nothing is currently known about whether or not he is still studying the Clefairy.",
