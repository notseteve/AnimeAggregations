She is best friends with Vanilla Mieux and is the daughter of the late witch Cinnamon. She has long, straight orange hair, large emerald green and impish eyes, and pointed ears. She is not as popular as Vanilla since her outrageous temper makes most boys scared of her, but is able to make friends with them instead. She is extremely popular in the magic world. Her familiar is a lazy but powerful frog named Duke. In the Magical World, she lives with her grandfather, Corn, a powerful wizard who, like Chocolat, has a certain dislike for Blanca and has a bad temper. Her birthday in August 13. As the series progresses, Chocolat begins to fall in love with Pierre and (in the anime) end up exchanging hearts with him (Episode 51). In the anime she loses the contest of being the next queen, however, Vanilla gave up the throne and gave it to Chocolat instead (making her the Queen of both the Magical World and the Ogre World). In the manga Chocolat and Pierre went missing and lost their memories which made them return a few years later, by Vanilla`s coronation.\nIn French, Chocolat`s name translates to \"Best Chocolate\".\nChocolat`s name may be romanized as Chocolat or Chocola. In the English manga published by Del Rey, her name is spelled Chocolat, from the French word for chocolate. In the anime, Chocolat has the power to purify noir hearts after Amber gave her a potion.\nSpell: Sugar Sugar Rune! Choco-Rune!",
