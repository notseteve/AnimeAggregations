She has a very sharp and brilliant mind, and is well-loved by the people of Estabul.\nWhile technically, Noa was the figurehead of the rebellion against Estabul`s liege country, Roland, she was actually used by Salawel, a noble of Estabul whom she trusts. After the rebellion was suppressed by Claugh Klom and Miran Froaude, she was nearly killed by Froaude if not for Claugh`s intervention. Thereafter, she was inducted into the nobility of Roland as part of a peaceful effort to stabilize Estabul, and subsequently resides within the royal compounds of Roland. She is in a love relationship with Claugh, who is six years older, and constantly worries about his well-being as he has a tendency to overdo things.",
