He is a very bright student with a realistic, dependable, but \"fence-sitter\" personality. Because he often listens to http://anidb.net/ch3719 [Ichiko] and is shown to admire her on many levels, it is implied that he has a crush on her, but http://anidb.net/ch3719 [Ichiko] herself shows no signs of noticing this.",
