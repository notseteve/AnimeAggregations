  "description" : "Dorami, also known as Dorami-chan, is the sister of http://anidb.net/ch8456 [Doraemon]. She happens to be about 2 years younger than him. Strangely enough, they are siblings due to the fact that they shared half of the oil from a can. She lives in the 22nd-century Tokyo with http://anidb.net/ch76800 [Sewashi], http://anidb.net/ch8465 [Nobita]`s great-great-grandson. She is yellow and has ears that resemble a large red bow. She likes melonpan and is afraid of cockroaches. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon (Dorami is able to produce 10,000 horse power, in comparison to Doraemon`s 129.3). She sometimes visits Nobita with a time machine when Doraemon is \"off-duty\" or to help Doraemon with something. She also has her own spin-off manga.",
