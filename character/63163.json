All the soldiers who were sent to the Dungeon died, and the Emperor decided to send Dragul as well. He recruited more people among the population, with Sinbad among them. Only Dragul and Sinbad managed to reach the Baal`s throne room, where they had a duel in order to decide who will take Baal`s power for himself. In the end, Sinbad won.\nHe was the first of the Eight Generals to meet http://anidb.net/ch63160 [Sinbad] and the first member of Sinbad`s Household.\nSource: Magi Wiki, edited.",
