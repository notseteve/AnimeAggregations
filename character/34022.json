  "description" : "Diana is the goddess of \"the hunt and the moon\", as well as the first goddess Keima encounters who resides in Tenri`s body. Keima first meets Diana when he assumes she is a Weiss, but Tenri manages to convince him otherwise after she tells Keima about how she first met Diana, who saved them both ten years ago from the Weiss. Because of her knowledge which Elsie and Haqua aren`t aware of, Keima visits her when he wants to know more about the relationship between Heaven and the Underworld. When Diana takes over Tenri`s body, she appears with slanted eyes in contrast to Tenri`s rounded eyes. Diana acts cold, selfish and thoughtless most of the time which tends to irk some people, yet she is very supportive of Tenri`s love for Keima. She wishes for Tenri and Keima to be a couple as it would restore her powers, despite being disgusted that Keima has managed to make other girls fall in love with him as well. Diana is also the one who originally requested that Keima should find her sisters, in exchange for helping him seal back the Weiss. Later on in the series, after Keima apologises to her for his indecisiveness, Diana regains more of her powers and now has the ability to use her angel wings.",
