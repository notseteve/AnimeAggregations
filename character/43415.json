  "description" : "The famous Newtype Amuro Ray is now the ace pilot of the Earth Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce. During the One Year War, this young civilian became the pilot of the original RX-78 Gundam, and during the Gryps Conflict of U.C. 0087 he joined the Karaba resistance group to combat a tyrannical faction of the Earth Federation Forces. Rejoining the Federation, Amuro was assigned to the Londo Bell unit, which patrols the space colonies for signs of rebellion. As a result, this veteran pilot now finds himself on the frontlines of the new struggle against his longtime rival Char Aznable. Amuro is now a confident adult, with no trace of his old fears and insecurities, but his encounters with Char show that he still retains the hot temper of his teenage years.\nSource: Official Site",
