  "description" : "Oda Nobunaga, known as Dai Rokuten Maou (The sixth Heavenly Demon King), wants to take over the world. With the help of his Juunishinshou, he was working to achieve that goal, but he was killed by Kyou at Honnoji Temple. Since he was important to the Mibu`s plans, the Mibu Clan resurrected him in Lord Torii`s body. Lord Torii`s body was given to the Mibu by Kyoushirou to seek his revenge against Kyou. Kyou defeated Nobunaga at the Battle of Seikigahara. Nobunaga was again resurrected and later encountered Kyou in Aokigahara Forest.",
