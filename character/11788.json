  "description" : "Katou Masaru is one of the two main protagonists of the series. He is summoned, along with http://anidb.net/ch11787 [Kurono], by Gantz after they were hit by a subway train while helping an unconscious hobo who fell on the tracks. He is a childhood friend of Kurono and serves as a secondary protagonist. At school, he acts as a guardian to the weaker students who often find themselves bullied, getting himself a bit of a reputation for fighting. He initially lives with an aunt who reluctantly adopted him and his brother after they were orphaned. They leave after Katou could no longer stand their aunt hitting his little brother.\nHe is killed during the Thousand Arms mission. He is later revived near the end of Phase 1 by Suzuki Yoshikazu who asked Kurono who he wanted to revive. After that, he manages to kill Nurarihyon and gains 100 points, choosing to revive Kurono.\nSource: Wikipedia",
