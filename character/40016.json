  "description" : "Haru`s Brain Burst avatar, Silver Crow, has a tall, thin, fragile metallic frame that is completely devoid of weapons, forcing Haru to fight barehanded. His avatar was created by his desires to be thinner and fly away into the sky in order to escape his miserable life. The avatar possesses a mouth underneath its visor, allowing Silver Crow to eat while in the game world. Silver Crow is the first and only avatar with the ability to fly, sprouting wings on its back when its special ability is activated. Lacking in both physical strength and defensive capability, Silver Crow is dependent on Haru`s squash-honed speed and reflexes in order to survive fights. Silver Crow`s default finishing move is a basic headbutt, typically ineffective in most circumstances. Haru eventually learns how to utilize the Incarnate System to focus his willpower, gaining the ability to form energy blades from the bracers on Silver Crow`s forearms, a technique he names \"Laser Sword.\" For a period of time, Silver Crow has the Disaster Armor Enhanced Armament and becomes the 6th Chrome Disaster. In this form, he can predict the attacks of his opponents and use all the abilities of previous Chrome Disasters. In one battle, he can partially summon the uncorrupted form of The Destiny, which is one of the Seven Arcs used to form the Chrome Disaster Armament that was created by Chrome Falcon.\nSource: Wiki",
