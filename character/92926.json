  "description" : "A tall, cool-and-collected, glamorous catgirl. But despite her stature, she`s actually the third youngest after the twins. She has a mild complex about having a not-quite-feminine appearance, but her loyalty to her master (Shigure) is worlds beyond any dog`s and her Maine Coon strength is extraordinary. She loves helping people when she can, though this rarely ends well thanks to her poor coordination.",
