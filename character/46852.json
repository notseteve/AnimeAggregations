  "description" : "Dalzollene is a leader of Neon Nostrade`s bodyguards and Kurapika`s direct superior. His weapon is a katana inscribed with runes that increase its power when infused Nen. In the anime, he manages to pierce Uvogin by 5 millimeters with the katana. He appears to enjoy music and is dedicated to his job. He also is not hesitant to sacrifice three of Neon`s bodyguards when he predicts Troupe activity at the Yorknew Underground Auction. He has developed his Ten so that he can defend himself from ten bullets. He is later killed by Phinks, as the Phantom Troupe infiltrates a Nostrade compound in order to rescue a captured Uvogin.\nSource: Wiki",
