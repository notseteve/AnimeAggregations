  "description" : "Inukai is a witch who specializes in fortune-telling, and is also http://anidb.net/ch80570 [Akane]`s friend. Due to her half-animal appearance, she wears a cloak that covers her face and body so that she doesn`t draw attention. She has a hamster familiar named http://anidb.net/ch80600 [Aru].\nAfter a night of heavy drinking, she ate some chocolates which turn people into animals, made by Akane, and became an anthropomorphic dog. As the chocolates didn`t work correctly she simply has the face, ears, and tail of a dog, as well as furry skin, and returns to her http://anidb.net/ch85088 [human form] at night. She has been looking for a way to contact Akane for a year to find a cure which will return her to human form permanently.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
