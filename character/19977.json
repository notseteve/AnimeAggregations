  "description" : "Hiramaru Kazuya is a new mangaka who, one day, picked up Shounen Jump for the first time in his life, and decided to quit his job to draw manga. His series is called Otters 11 and became serialized around the same time as http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro] and http://anidb.net/ch16787 [Takagi]. He can be overwhelmed easily and finds it hard to deal with the stress of writing a manga. He frequently shows up at the other mangaka`s studios to hide, but is always soon found out by his editor. He complains about his job a lot and wonders aloud why he ever decided to do it in the first place, but consistently ranks high with the readers in the questionnaires. Due to this, he has been called as a manga genius possibly on the level of http://anidb.net/ch19971 [Niizuma Eiji], especially considering he has barely read any manga.\nSource: Wikipedia",
