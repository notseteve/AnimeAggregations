She is also an excellent cook, especially of sweets, and has become involved with Guchuko as a result. Kyou`s mother frequently tries to convince Guchuko to stay in their house, with usually bad results. Kyou has been the only person who has ever been able to hold Guchuko; this was once when she helped Guchuko get out of a bush and another when she believed Guchuko had died.",
