  "description" : "Kahlua Marjoram is the fourth member of the Galaxy Angel Rune troupe. She has a very quiet, gentle personality, speaking in a slow, rather laid-back tone. Her unique addition to the team is that she can use magic. She is from the Majoram Bloodline, which is a family known for their very powerful sorcery. Ultimately, she is a very powerful sorceress, though she is unable to use much of her power except during times of emotional distress. She sometimes transforms into \"Tequila Marjoram\", a bright purple-haired girl. Along with a distinct change in personality after the transformation (for example, she is more aggressive and hot-tempered), Tequila is capable of using the full potential of her magic power. Another noticeable difference between them is Tequila`s bust size. The transformation is triggered by Kahlua being exposed to alcohol, though the transformation can also be controlled by the consumption of a medication Kahlua invented. A running gag has Kahlua accidentally ingesting alcohol, bringing a less-than-amused Tequila into the scene.\nHer personal color is light green. In battle, she (as Tequila) pilots the new Emblem Frame \"Spell Caster\", which has high defense and an attack called Hexa Cross-Break.",
