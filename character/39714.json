  "description" : "Shintarou was Kiseki no Sedai`s best shooter, none of his teammates remember him to miss a shoot.\nHe has a high keen to horoscopes and listens to oha saha horoscope every day and carries the lucky item they recommend. He believes that if you try hard, your fate will follow.\nHe shows a huge attention to his fingers and always polishes and adjusts his nails and keeps them bandaged.\nDespite saying he dislikes Kuroko, he actually cares so deep about him (as his friend says) and always mentions that he highly respects Kuroko`s style of playing.\nIt seems that he envies Kagami for being Kuroko`s new \"light\".",
