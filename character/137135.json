  "description" : "Latla has short dark purple hair, which goes just past her ears and almost reaches her shoulders. She has bangs that cover her eyebrows and rest above her eyes. Latla wears big hoop earrings and has the under logo on both sides of her head as a hair accessory. Her skin is slightly tanned. She has sharp cat-like eyes, which are dark purple.\nHer outfit changes with each appearance, varying from a dress to a shoulderless sweater.\nIn a flashback, we see that Latla used to have long hair that reached halfway down her back. She had freckles that ran across her nose, which she presumably hides with makeup in the present.",
