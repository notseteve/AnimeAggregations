  "description" : "Touya is the older brother of Kinomoto Sakura. His birthday is on February 29th, which makes him a leap year baby, a person that can only \"properly\" celebrate their birthday once every four years. His blood type is O. He holds the belief that as Sakura`s older brother, he is the only person entitled to make fun of her, a belief that his best friend Tsukishiro Yukito refers to as a \"sister complex.\" However, he is also protective and caring of her, which leads him to dislike Li Shaoran when he finds Shaoran cornering Sakura in the schoolyard. Though Shaoran and Sakura eventually stop fighting, Touya continues to dislike Shaoran when he becomes friends with Sakura.\nHe is often working, and a running gag in the series involves Sakura and Yukito running into him while he`s at work, which can happen virtually anywhere.\nHe is a perceptive young man and has had a vague idea as to what Sakura has been up to as a Cardcaptor, despite Sakura`s attempts to keep it a secret. Touya was born with some magical ability, allowing him to see ghosts (including the one of his late mother). His magical ability is also what helps him sense when Sakura is in danger or when she is doing other \"magical\" things.",
