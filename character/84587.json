  "description" : "Alma Karma is one of two Second Exorcists successfully created during the Artificial Disciple Program carried out by the Chan and Epstein families nine years ago. Alma was an upbeat but emotional child and was good friends with http://anidb.net/ch84586 [Kanda Yuu], although Kanda was initially hostile towards him.\nUpon learning that Kanda was to be \"terminated\" for regaining his memories, he knocked out the attendants and escaped with Kanda. He was able to truly bond with his Innocence in an attempt to save Kanda; however, he learns that as a Second Exorcists, he possesses the brain of an Exorcist killed in battle and his brain is that of the female Exorcist Kanda loved. After learning the truth about himself, he kills the scientists working on the project. He also attacks Kanda, hoping to die with him and end their suffering as Second Exorcists. However, Kanda refuses and cuts Alma to pieces. Alma is later sewn back together and kept barely alive somewhere in the North American branch of http://anidb.net/ch32498 [the Black Order]. http://anidb.net/ch32502 [The Central] uses him to house the shard of the Akuma egg recovered by http://anidb.net/ch32788 [Howard Link] and creates Third Exorcists from special cells produced by his body.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
