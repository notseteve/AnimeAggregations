  "description" : "Louise`s classmate. A triangle fire mage, she is from a Germanian military background. She attends the Academy, rather than a local school, because of the bad reputation she had gained for her misbehaviour in her homeland. Her parents tried to marry her off to an older man to improve the family`s reputation. Instead, she came to the Academy. She has dark skin and a large bust. She is fully aware of the effect her looks have on men, and uses them to her advantage. Fire magic is her speciality — drawn from her strong passion for love. The territory she is from has long since had a dislike for the La Vallière family and she enjoys making fun of Louise.",
