  "description" : "The Indian boy who Mikage wants to replace http://anidb.net/ch6889 [Anthy] with. His pale purple hair and dark skin resemble that of Anthy, http://anidb.net/ch8697 [Akio], and http://anidb.net/ch8696 [Dios]. Mamiya is the younger brother of http://anidb.net/ch9018 [Chida Tokiko], a woman employed by the Ootori Academy board, whom Mikage had become infatuated with back when he was Professor Nemuro. Mamiya was born with a mysterious, life-threatening illness, to which Tokiko hoped that the mysterious project Nemuro and the one hundred boys were working on could cure. Mikage became more driven to complete the project, also hoping that it could cure Mamiya.\nAt first, it was believed that Mamiya was the one who set fire to Nemuro Memorial Hall so the gates to the Duelling Arena could open, and years later Mamiya and Mikage would start sending out the Black Rose Duellists to challenge http://anidb.net/ch6847 [Tenjou Utena]. During that time, Mikage was the only one whom Mamiya ever had contact with besides the Duellists, who bare no memory of the meeting once their black rose was destroyed, so his existence was not acknowledged by anyone else on campus besides Akio and Tokiko. Once the final black rose had been given to Mikage, it was revealed that Mamiya had actually died years ago, and that the Mikage Mamiya had been living with for all these years was an illusion Akio created, and that it was Mikage himself that set fire to the Hall, so he could give eternity to Mamiya. Once Mikage disappeared, it was revealed that the fake Mamiya might have possibly been Anthy.",
