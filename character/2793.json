He likes to hit on virtually every girl he lays eyes on, even Rinna in one episode. He shows particular interest in Yayoi, though it`s not clear what her feelings for him may be. [Spoiler]He confesses his feelings to her and was turned down, but Yayoi later hints he might still have some hope.[/Spoiler]\n(Wikipedia)",
