  "description" : "Ash and his friends first encountered Duplica`s Ditto when they ran into Imitehouse to get out of the rain. Ash`s attention quickly turned to a `Pikachu` noise behind him and he was surprised to see another Pikachu beside his own Pikachu. Misty thought the `Pikachu` was cute and she picked it only to be surprised by its odd looking face. Misty quickly dropped Duplica`s Ditto as she didn`t know what`s wrong with the Pikachu. Brock`s first reaction was that it was new kind of Pikachu after he examined it and Ash tried to capture it but Duplica stopped him by throwing a Poke ball at his Poke ball.\nDuplica was training her Ditto which was having problems transforming perfectly. Her Imitehouse theater wasn`t getting any patrons because they didn`t want to see a Ditto that couldn`t transform perfectly. Team Rocket appeared and stole Duplica`s Ditto and tried to get it to transform. It wasn`t until Meowth threatened to use its claw on Duplica`s Ditto that it finally was able to transform properly. Duplica`s Ditto tried to transform again and was able to transform perfectly from that point on.\nDuplica`s Ditto can also transform into objects, not just Pok√©mon. It has been seen transforming into a book, a picture and a canon.",
