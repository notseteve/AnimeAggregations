  "description" : "Yuushi was found as an infant by the knight Gunbard after a battle, and became his adopted daughter. Due to an unknown curse, she stopped growing at the age of ten, and looks like a child despite the fact that she is now seventeen.\nYuushi is very cheerful and gregarious, but she has a very strong desire to break her curse and become an adult. One of the reasons is that she often feels that being small in size is a hinder to others, thus wishing to grow up.\nYuushi becomes a Platinum Princess candidate after she sees the light of the Eternal Tiara, which is not visible to others. It is also said that she is the princess of the human world, seen in the last episode. However, there is no evidence to prove it.\nShe also loves Arc.",
