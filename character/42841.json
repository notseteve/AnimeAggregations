  "description" : "Nanase Haruka is the vice president of the Babel Student Council, and is also chair of the school`s committee on public morals. As such, she tries to confront Akatsuki for his perverted behaviour, but, underestimating his power, winds up becoming the victim of his antics instead, for example having her bra and panties stolen out from under her clothes when she tries to attack him, and getting stripped completely naked by him during the beach game, when Akatsuki would just take the tops off other girls` bikinis. As such, she appears to dislike Akatsuki, but towards the end of the series she seems to develop a crush on him in classic tsundere fashion.\nShe uses wind magic, and her AD is in the form of mid-handled blades somewhat resembling large Eskimo ulu knives.",
