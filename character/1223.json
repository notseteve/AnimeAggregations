  "description" : "Bonsly is a small pot-like creature resembling a bonsai tree. The creature was introduced in 2004 in an issue of Coro Coro Magazine. Bonsly makes its proper and most playable debut in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, the game it was first advertised as being involved in.\nDespite its tree-like appearance, Bonsly is actually made of rock. Bonsly often shed tears, though it has been found out that those are \"fake tears\", and that it is adjusting its body fluid level (appropriately enough, it can learn the move Fake Tears, which sharply decreases its target`s Special Defense) Wild Bonsly exist only in the Pearl Version, and upon learning how to Mimic, they evolve into the familiar Sudowoodo.\nIts first anime appearance is in the eighth Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. However, its name is mispronounced in that movie; Bonsly is to be pronounced similarly to \"bonsai\", half of its namesake, the other being sly, for shedding \"crocodile tears\" Bonsly also appears in the \"From Cradle to Save\" episode, where Brock obtains it. Brock`s Bonsly eventually evolved into Sudowoodo.\nAlthough regarded as a 4th generation Pokémon, it was included in the 2005 game Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, where the player must rescue one from the wreckage of S.S. Libra and reunite it with its trainer, a small girl. It also appears as a statue in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon as a reward.",
