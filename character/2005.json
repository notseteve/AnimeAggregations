  "description" : "Guts` adoptive father, and leader of a mercenary band, Gambino trained Guts to be a mercenary like himself and even gave Guts his first scar (across his nose) during a practice fight. Gambino sold Guts as a sex slave one night to Donovan, a pederast soldier, who anally raped young Guts and whom Guts brutally murders afterwards. Gambino was later hit by a cannon blast in battle and lost his leg and the ability to fight. This incensed his anger towards Guts even further, as he also blamed Guts for the death of his lover, Shizu. Gambino became drunk one night and tried to kill Guts in a fit of rage. He admits he sold Guts to Donovan for three silver coins right before Guts killed him in self-defense. He constantly haunts Guts during his early years before the massacre of the original Band of Hawk.",
