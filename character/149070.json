She acts very friendly towards http://anidb.net/ch149066 [Toono Sawako] and seems worried when she hears that http://anidb.net/ch149067 [Mr. Toono] won`t be coming home for several days due to a work assignment.\nIn reality she and her husband want the Toono couple to move out - apparently there is a treasure hidden at their house. To claim it for themselves the Yamabe couple start the rumours about Toono`s house being haunted by ghosts.",
