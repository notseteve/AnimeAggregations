  "description" : "Shinko is a beginning trainer that was at Professor Rowan lab the day that Dawn went to visit him for the first time after competing in the Sinnoh Grand Festival. Shinko likes to take notes of everything so she doesn`t forget and can review and study at a later time.\nWhile she was contemplating which Pokémon she wanted to pick as her first Pokémon, the Piplup and Chimchar began fighting and the window in Professor Rowan lab broke and the two Pokémon quickly jumped out through it. Professor Rowan and Dawn were outside when they heard Shinko scream. Shinko already knew who Dawn was as she had watched her at the Grand Festival. While traveling in the forest together to find the missing Pokémon, Shinko congratulated Dawn and told her that it was an honor to be able to talk to her as she thought Dawn was a great role model and had been studying her techniques.\nDawn and Shinko chased after the two escaped Pokémon and were cornered and captured by a group of Ariados. With the help of Dawn`s Quilava, they were able to rescue the Pokémon and return to the lab. The same events happened to Dawn when she was selecting her first Pokémon as well, so Dawn and Shinko share a common experience.\nProfessor Rowan asked Shinko when she returned to the lab after her ordeal in the forest if she had decided what Pokémon she wished to chose as her starter Pokémon. She explained to Professor Rowan that she wanted to wait a bit so she could learn a bit more about them before she made her final decision. Shinko became friends with Dawn after that day and was at the boat dock waving goodbye to Dawn who was off to the Houen region.",
