  "description" : "Using the pen name Subaru Kurumigawa, shy high-schooler Kurumi has secretly become the author of a manga that is so popular it has been made into an anime. She works hard on her manga, to the point of falling asleep on the drawing table, but keeps her identity secret from those who know her in real life. Due to the masculine nature of Kurumi`s pen name, most of her audience assumes that she is male (including Tanpopo, who later concludes that Kurumi is a homosexual man).\n[Source: wiki]",
