  "description" : "The GM II is a minor revision of the mass-produced mobile suit used by the Earth Federation Forces during the One Year War. While it`s undergone modest improvements to its armour materials and sensor systems, and been fitted with the standard linear floating seat and panoramic screen, the GM II is no match for modern mobile suits. In the early stages of the Gryps Conflict, this obsolete machine is used by both the AEUG and the Earth Federation Forces, but it`s soon retired in favour of newer models.",
