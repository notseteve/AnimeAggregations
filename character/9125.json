  "description" : "Lum`s best childhood friend. She appears to be a sweet and lovely redhead, but in actuality has a violent split personality. Her special power is the ability to suck the vitality out of a person`s mouth while kissing them. She can also use this power in reverse. As a child, Ran was often hurt or got into trouble because of the antics of the more carefree and irresponsible Lum. Also, she is in love with Rei who unfortunately still loves Lum. For these reasons, she came to Earth in order to get revenge against her one-time friend. To do this, she pretends to like Ataru, flirting with him consistently (Ran is the only other character than Lum who calls Ataru \"darling\"), just so she can kiss him and drain his youth away. Ran is an excellent cook, always hoping against hope that the way to Rei`s heart is through his stomach.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
