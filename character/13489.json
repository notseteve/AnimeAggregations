Andrei holds a grudge against his father for not protecting his mother 14 years before the beginning of the second season and joins the HRL military and later the A-Laws to forge his own path. Andrei meets Louise Halevy and develops a relationship as he sees her more suited as a lady then a soldier, often protecting her in battle.\nAfter the AEU`s orbital elevator collapse as a result of a coup d`état by the Federation`s military, Andrei kills his father in a fit of rage when Andrei assumes that Sergei sided with the coup d`état forces. He eventually comes to terms with his father`s actions and in the epilogue, continues to serve in the Federation army in relief efforts in order to live up to his mother and father`s hopes for the world.",
