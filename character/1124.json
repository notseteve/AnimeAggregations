  "description" : "Sanae is Nagisa`s mother. Normally she`s very childish and a cry-baby, but when needed she can be very strong-willed and dependable. She runs the Furukawa Bakery with her husband Akio. She often tries out strange concepts to make breads that are anything but edible and never get sold. Outside of the bakery, she tutors children. She`s quite proud of the way people often mistaken her as Nagisa`s older sister because of her youthful appearance. When Akio accidentally makes Sanae cry because of his accidental bad remarks on her bread, he will have to chase after her with her bread stuffed into his mouth, to calm her down, or else she will run around the town crying.",
