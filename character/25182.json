  "description" : "It`s a PT that was co-developed by Mao Industries, and uses the same nuclear fusion reactor that is found in the 009. There were three units created, and they are equipped with the G Impact Cannon, and the Gravicon (Gravity Controller) system which uses EOT. It`s capable of spreading a gravitational field in front of it due to the Gravicon system, which allows the gravity wall to block the enemy`s attack. It`s the first unit to be equipped with the T-Link System.\nIn addition, the Huckebein MK-II`s are brother units to the R series since knowledge used to make the R machines were used on them.\nThe first unit was used by Brooklyn Luckfield. The second was damaged during a battle with the UCC, but is later repaired into the Huckebein Trombe. The third went missing during the war.",
