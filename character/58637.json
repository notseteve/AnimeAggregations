  "description" : "Shuu is Raku`s best friend; they have known each other since pre-school. He is the kind of person that would do anything for a laugh, and often makes perverted passes or comments without shame to his friends. He is also very perceptive, knowing immediately that Raku was not really dating Chitoge, that Raku and Onodera have secret crushes on each other, and that Tsugumi develops feelings for Raku. He uses this knowledge for his enjoyment. On academic rankings, he places next to his \"glasses buddy\" Ruri, much to the latter`s chagrin. He has not expressed romantic interest in Raku`s friends, but has expressed interest in their homeroom teacher Kyouko.\nSource: Wiki",
