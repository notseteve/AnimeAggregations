  "description" : "An easygoing high school student who adapts easily to new surroundings. He loses the vision in his left eye to the Nue and Yakou and finds himself trapped in a simulation of the Edo period. Called the \"unwritten page\" by some in the virtual Edo, as his fate isn`t foretold by Heaven`s Net. The demons that want to protect the world want to make him the new \"Teiten\" or God of Amatsuki, since he is just as powerful as the current one.",
