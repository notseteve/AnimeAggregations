  "description" : "The Vigna Ghina is a prototype command mobile suit that is assigned to Cecily Fairchild after she rejoins the Ronah family. Based on the Crossbone Vanguard`s Berga series, this new model is equipped with a set of fin nozzles which are connected directly to its generator, yielding even greater performance. With its high mobility and power output, the Vigna Ghina is the most advanced mobile suit yet developed by the Crossbone Vanguard.\nWhen Cecily defects to the Earth Federation Forces during the Crossbone Vanguard invasion of UC 0123, her Vigna Ghina is also given a powerful beam launcher similar to that used by the http://anidb.net/ch1726 [Gundam F91], capable of delivering a wider and more damaging beam blast than a standard beam rifle. Berah`s Vigna Ghina was destroyed in a battle against the mobile armor http://anidb.net/ch1728 [XMA-01 Rafflesia], piloted by her father, Carozzo Ronah.",
