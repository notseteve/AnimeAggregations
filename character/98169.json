  "description" : "Zeraora is a bipedal feline Pokémon that has black underfur and yellow fur on its head, forearms, chest, hips, and upper legs. Blue fur can also be seen on its forehead, chest, and whiskers. Its eyes and paw-pads are similarly blue. Black zigzagging stripes can be seen on its thighs and forearms. It has four-fingered paws, while its feet have three toes each. A long, yellow, thunderbolt-shaped ponytail extends from the back of its head, giving the appearance of an actual tail.\nZeraora can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents generated from its paw-pads. This magnetic field can allow Zeraora to levitate and fly through the air at high speeds. It can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Unlike most Electric-type Pokémon, Zeraora does not have organs to create electricity; instead, it gathers and stores it from outside sources, then uses it as its own electric energy. Its fur is known to stand on its ends all across the body whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity.\nZeraora is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Plasma Fists.",
