  "description" : "Taiin is a wind user who resembles a young girl with high pigtails. She also has a childish personality despite living for so long. She was said to be rash by a fair few of the Shinshou. Tai`in attacks with mini tornadoes and can also use the wind to communicate and pass messages. She can also `read` the wind to know what is happening at other places but she is not good at it. Because of her personality, she is often at the receiving end of one of Byakko`s lectures with the current record that lasts 8 hours. Taiin does not like slimy things and often appears with Genbu. She can create a tornado to transport people to other places but the ride is usually very rough. A recurring gag in the series is that whenever she uses this, Masahiro and Genbu falls on the ground with only the other Shinshou remaining standing.\nSource: Wiki",
