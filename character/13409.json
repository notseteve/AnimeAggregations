  "description" : "Major General Olivier Mira Armstrong is http://anidb.net/ch6589 [Alex Louis Armstrong]`s older sister. She is in charge of keeping peace on the northern borders of Amestris from her domain, the Briggs Fortress.\nOlivier is a dauntless woman who scoffs at the concept of \"equivalent exchange\" and believes \"survival of the fittest\" is the only law in life. Her subordinates are incredibly loyal to her, however, if their attachment to her were to ever put Briggs at any open risk, they are instructed to leave their leader behind. She despises http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang] and is brutal towards her little brother, considering them both to be weak and insulting to the state military. Perhaps her closest subordinate and friend is http://anidb.net/ch13411 [Major Miles], a man of mixed blood with great appreciation towards the General.\nOlivier is first introduced when http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] are sent north with a letter of introduction from Alex to see his older sister. Once in the frigid, snowy plains of the Briggs Mountain range, they are attacked by http://anidb.net/ch13410 [Buccaneer] (believing them to be Drachman spies), and taken before the General herself. Olivier is quick to dismiss her brother`s letter and informs the two brothers that she only judges people with her own eyes.",
