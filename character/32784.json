  "description" : "Froi Tiedoll is a former artist who is loyal to his work and fatherly towards his disciples. He is the General in charge of http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda], http://anidb.net/ch32930 [Marie], http://anidb.net/ch32779 [Chaozii], and http://anidb.net/ch32780 [Daisya]. He is often seen sketching and drawing the nature. He was devastated when his apprentice, Daisya died.\nThe Maker of Eden, his Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, takes the form of a crucifix and a rod, and a spiritual chisel. The crucifix drives the chisel into the ground, creating doll-like creatures. Another ability of his Innocence is to create an orb-like light around Tiedoll that destroys any http://anidb.net/t6684 [Akuma] it comes into contact with. He can also create a large forest of thorns to defend people, known as the Embracing Garden.\nSource: Wikipedia",
