  "description" : "Suehara Kyouko is a third year at Himematsu High, plays captain position. She is usually the one that briefs the team about their opponents. She doesn`t have any special powers per se, but she is quite adept at three-player mahjong. While Hiroe comes to the table with the mentality that she`ll win, she comes to the table with the mentality that she`s going to lose. As such, she`s always very careful and calculative during the match, passing up a potential win for a higher scoring hand. She took up the challenge of facing against monsters in the captain`s position despite being a normal player and as such, Saki considers her as the most resilient player as Kyouko was able to turn a decent scoring hand into a high scoring hand against players with special abilities and win.\nSource: Wiki",
