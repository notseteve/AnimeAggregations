  "description" : "Currently the substitute-Supreme Pontiff of the Amakusa Catholics. He has impressionable pitch-black hair and a unique sense of fashion. He wears an over-sized shirt and his shoe laces are one meter long. He is an expert in Amakusa-style combat and is equipped with a 180-centimeter-long Flamberge.\nIn terms of personality, he`s similar to Touma. He doesn`t need a reason to save people, which resulted in him attempting to help Ursula. This was due to him wanting to rebuild the Amakusa Church into something that can be called a home to Kanzaki Kaori again, so she doesn`t need to leave them again to protect them from getting involved in incidents due to her powers of a saint.",
