  "description" : "Shinobu, a 16-year-old ninja in training, is the star of the series. She is kind, hardworking, and dedicated, but naive and somewhat clumsy with complex tasks. She is slightly dense and misses the obvious, like Onsakumaru`s perverted deeds to her. She is usually charged with taking care of her dojo because everyone else is too lazy. She usually wears a purple and pink ninja outfit, but sometimes wears other costumes. Her ambiguous relationship with Kaede ranges from admiration and idolization to romantic interest, causing speculation about a lesbian relationship. Shinobu even once groped Kaede when bathing together, passing it off as her hands slipping, and once, when Kaede asked her who she romantically loved, she implied Kaede who didn`t actually get it. Despite the influence of Onsokumaru, she remains fairly innocent, although some of her dreams and fantasies suggest otherwise. The smiling face on her headband reflects her emotions.",
