  "description" : "Discovering Hunter and Shadow, she escorts the new team to Arachna so they may be officially inducted to the ranks of the Spider Riders. She seems to care a lot for Hunter, as does her spider for Shadow. She might also have a romantic relationship with Hunter too. She grows (using her power) most of the time when Hunter is deeply in fight and gets hurt. This proves that she could be the Oracle`s chosen one just like Aqune. She becomes especially worried when Hunter is hurt or in danger and becomes quite jealous when Hunter`s guy nature foolishly allows him to mention spending some time the night before with an unknown girl (Princess Sparkle) by pushing him into the fountain he slept next to that night. In \"Hunter`s Holiday\" Corona clearly expresses her desire to spend some time with Hunter alone but when he refuses she takes out her rage by practicing on targets with Hunter`s face on them.At the last episode,She say \"My Hunter.\" Though she is taller and more mature than Hunter, both are the same age (stated to be eleven, though they act around twelve to thirteen years old). She and her battle spider, Venus, make a great team. She has no family and was adopted by twins. When they found her, Corona had a manacle. It was revealed that she is Aqune`s long lost sister and that they are both \"Oracle Handmaids\". Her weapons are a bow and arrows.",
