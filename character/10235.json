  "description" : "Nomiya Takumi, along with Yamazaki and Miwako, is first introduced on episode 14 of season 1. Nomiya is the type of guy who could throw a cellphone in the sea full of women`s numbers, without caring at all as said by Mayama. Mayama is somewhat adverse to him, partially because he sees Nomiya as the ideal professional he wants to become and dislikes the comparison and also because of Nomiya`s interest in Yamada.\nNomiya is Mayama`s former boss at Fujiwara Design. He is decribed as handsome, intelligent and somewhat workaholic. Though he`s deemed by Mayama as a playboy, and is actually quite experienced with women, he falls in love with Yamada. He tries to visit her whenever he can, although he is aware of Yamada`s feelings for Mayama. Mayama tries to act as the middleman as much as he can in order to protect Yamada, as he doubts the sincerity of Nomiya`s feelings. However, Mayama finally gives in, realizing that Nomiya isn`t as evil as he thought. There are hints of this couple at the end of the series.\nSource: Wikipedia",
