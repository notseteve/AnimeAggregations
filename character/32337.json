  "description" : "Alder is the Elite Four Champion of the Unova region. When Trip was little, he went to watch Alder battle against a Trainer`s Herdier. During Ash and Trip`s Three-on-Three battle, Trip was annoyed that he wasn`t going to be strong enough to face the champion. Ash had never heard of Alder and Iris was quick to tell him that everyone in the Unova region longs to battle him including Trip. Trip then remembered his experience with Alder. Alder gave Trip some Pok√©mon food to feed his Buffron when he noticed Trip was a bit hesitant around it. Alder asked Trip what his dream was to which Trip replied that he wanted to become the champion. Alder promised Trip to defend the title of Champion until the day that he challenged him.",
