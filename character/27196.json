  "description" : "Alomomola, known as the Caring Pokémon, is a heart-shaped pink fish Pokémon with large dorsal and ventral fins. As it floats around in the ocean, it carries wounded Pokémon to shore. With their special membrane, they heal the Pokémon`s wounds.\nAlomomola first makes an appearance in the anime \"In The Shadow of Zekrom!\", as a wild Pokémon. It was the first Pokémon in the Unova region that Ash saw.\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized its \"nearly-unpronounceable name\", and stated that it being a \"Caring Pokémon\" makes it a pacifist.",
