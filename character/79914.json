  "description" : "Kaizaki Arata is a 27-year old man who only appears to be 17-years old high school student, as a result of participating as test subject in ReLife Project. He was approached by http://anidb.net/ch81232 [Yoake Ryou] who explained him the rules he need to follow and goal to achieve as a test subject, as well as gave him the pill that made him younger in appearance. Ryou also became his supervisor.\nAs a high school student, Arata is predictably seen as mature by his classmates and has no problem easily making friends. He has forgotten most of his high school lessons, so he needs to take many remedial tests.\nSource: Wikipedia",
