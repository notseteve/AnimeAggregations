  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch22084 [Bean]`s car is Buff the Roadbuster. It`s built on a Porsche chassis with a 730hp Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray engine block. The body is made of 5mm battleship armor plate, the windows are a combination of bulletproof glass and Lexgard and is capable of withstanding anything short of military weaponry. It also has gunports for http://anidb.net/ch42508 [Rally] and a P. A. for safe conversation. One reason why Bean`s courier rates are so high is due to the fact that Buff costs $1,000,000 to build and gets lousy gas mileage.",
