He appears to be a very considerate and kind to others, and is considered a prince in school because of his good looks, perfect grades, and charming personality. Azuma comes from a well-brought family of traditional Kado background and he is extremely capable in traditional Japanese rituals and customs, like Ikebana (the art of flower arranging), tea ceremonies, and traditional gardening. Born as the third son of the family, he is strictly forbidden to outshine his older brothers. For that reason he was forced to give up piano when he was young and turn to flute instead.",
