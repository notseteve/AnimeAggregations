  "description" : "Minato`s younger sister. She is 18 years old (younger than him by one year) a college student that is enrolled in Shindong Women`s University. Unlike Minato, Yukari has a very strong and confident personality. She comes to Tokyo to attend university and be closer to her mother and brother. She has a strong interest in handsome men, especially bishounen. This interest, however, is mostly a result of her hidden feelings for Minato, who she cares for deeply, which she cannot openly express. She is Shiina`s Ashikabi, and is helping him search for Kusano. Her forceful reputation, merciless attack style and as well as a penchant for diplaying a demonic facial visage, has earned her the title, `Demon Ashikabi`. Together with #107 Shiina they`re known as the most evil pair. They are the second-most feared right after the Hannya of the North. Carrying a bounty of 1,000,000,yen by an ashikabi who fought them. She is currently unaware that her brother is an Ashikabi and that Kusano is one of his Sekirei; she has expressed the desire that such a pairing might occur. Yukari has recently been taken prisoner by Izumi Higa in order to use Shiina`s power for himself. She seem to be unaware what Shiina is doing in her absence.",
