  "description" : "Harukaze Asuna is the main protagonist of the series. She`s quite enthusiastic about tennis to the point she will sometimes swing around objects (including a pitchfork much to her mother`s chagrin). She has a bad habit of misunderstanding certain comments made by others normally taking them as sexual innuendos. Asuna has terrible luck with the tennis court`s white lines and continually trips over them as a gag. She joined the team in order to achieve the perfect woman`s body and occasionally pictures herself as a much older more lewder woman.",
