  "description" : "Raven is a General in the Amestrian Military and one of the elite members of Central High Command in the capital. He made his first appearance while Colonel http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] contemplated how to go about using the information about http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley]`s true identity as a homunculus.\nAt first it appeared to Mustang that Raven can be trusted, based on his jovial nature and complimentary speech putting the nervous Colonel at ease, but when Mustang tested the waters by mentioning a rumor about the FÃ¼hrer being a homunculus, Raven led Roy into the Central Command room and repeated the rumor for all to hear, including Bradley himself, revealing that all of Central Command is already entrenched in the malevolent machinations taking place in Amestris at http://anidb.net/ch16464 [Father]`s behest.",
