  "description" : "Village Hidden in the Clouds (Kumogakure no Sato) is the Hidden Village of the Land of Lightning. As one of the five Great Ninja Villages, http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure] has a Kage as its leader, known as the http://anidb.net/ch16171 [Raikage]. The ninja from this village seem to specialize in Lightning Release techniques. A notable minority also seem to favor the use of Japanese-style swords (or katanas) as standard weapons, instead of the typical kunai that most shinobi wield; and, as a result, many Kumogakure ninjas seem to excel at swordsmanship. The village is located on a high mountain, and is literally hidden in the clouds. The Raikage lives in a large building built into the tallest mountain.\nKumogakure, like http://anidb.net/ch12200 [Iwagakure] and http://anidb.net/ch12199 [Kirigakure], had two tailed beasts in its possession: the Two-Tailed Monster Cat in http://anidb.net/ch7721 [Nii Yugito], and the Eight-Tailed Giant Ox in http://anidb.net/ch13998 [Killer Bee]. What makes this village unique is the fact that the villagers were outraged when both Yugito and Killer Bee were captured by http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki], as most villages had shunned their Jinchuuriki. Yugito and Killer Bee had a great deal of control over their tailed beasts, such that both were able to fully transform into their beasts. Due to the immense powers of releasing their beasts fully, despite retaining control of themselves, the Fourth Raikage forbade at least Killer Bee from doing so.",
