Powerful and a B-rank, she is one of the Four Devas of Nanyo. She has a habit of wearing a blue miniskirted French maid outfit and specialises in submission wrestling moves, throws, and joint attacks, which she uses in conjunction with a pair of handcuffs she carries; she is also very proficient in making chi blasts.\nSource: Wikipedia",
