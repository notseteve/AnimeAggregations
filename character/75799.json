  "description" : "Valerie`s Sylveon attempted to cheer up Valerie when she was concerned about finding some models for her Florges and Lisyan patterns that were part of the Furisode Collection.\nDuring the Gym battle against Ash Ketchum, it faced off against Ash`s Fletchinder in the first match up. Valerie talked to her Sylveon in Pok√©mon language and it was able to more or less understand what she wanted to do. Valerie`s Sylveon being a Fairy type is delicate but strong. It used its tail ribbons to its advantage during the battle to capture Ash`s Fletchinder from moving about but he countered that but charging right into Sylveon with Flame Charge. The battle came to a climax when the two charged at each other with Giga Impact and Steel Wing but Ash`s Fletchinder came out victorious and knocked out Valerie`s Sylveon to win the first match-up.",
