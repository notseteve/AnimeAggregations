  "description" : "Rikuo is a boy who attends high school with his friend Masaki. He is a very talented piano player (enough to win the grand prize at a competition), but after witnessing an android playing a piece flawlessly, he questions why he plays when an android could clearly play better. For this reason he has quit playing. Since childhood he`s been taught to treat robots and androids like tools, as it is normal in this near-future society, evidenced in how he treats his android, Sammy. One day, while reviewing Sammy`s activity log, he finds an entry that says, \"Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?\"",
