  "description" : "Soldier who attempts to assassinate Kaiser Reinhard at the Phezzan War Cemetery as vengeance for his family that perished in the thermonuclear bombing of Westerland during the Lippstadt Rebellion.\nThe Westerland incident was particularly sensitive for Reinhard, given that he had failed to prevent the attack despite knowing of it, and was later taken to task by Siegfried Kircheis for this sin of omission. Thrown into emotional turmoil by the assassins taunting and cutting barbs, he seeks comfort in Hilda`s arms and ends up sleeping with her. This in turn leads to his marriage proposal to her and the eventual birth of Alexander.",
