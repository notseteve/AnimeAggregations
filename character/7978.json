She is named for the mineral petzite and is the counterpart of Kino Makoto.\nPetz often clashes with Calaveras, but the majority of both women`s operations end up with them working together. She is very proud and is willing to step on others to achieve personal glory and power. She also appears bitter over a past relationship and reacts strongly when Calaveras teases her about it.\nHer attack is Dark Thunder, in which she threw a blast of black lightning toward her target.\nSource: wiki",
