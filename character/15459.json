  "description" : "Kana is Rikuo`s childhood friend and neighbor. She first appears in the original Nurarihyon no Mago one-shot as Yura Usami and says she hates things relating to youkai and spirit mediums. She is hinted to have some affection for Rikuo, as she gets jealous seeing Rikuo and Tsurara together. Rikuo made a promise to help her if she is ever in need. After being kidnapped by a youkai on her 13th birthday, she was saved by \"Night\" Rikuo and was taken to a youkai party. The next morning Kana asked Rikuo if he was friends with his youkai form and blushed when Rikuo asked why. She has fallen for Rikuo`s Night form. However, it is hinted that she is also starting to like Rikuo as she is much concerned and distracted when Tsurara gets too close to him.",
