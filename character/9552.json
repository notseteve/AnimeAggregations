  "description" : "The Second Neck, she is a purple-haired nun who is the first Orochi to appear and attack, having lost her faith due to living through a terrible war. Although there is little co-operation among the Orochi, she seems to be the closest thing therein to a second-in-command having great respect for Tsubasa and the most cool-headed of the lot; it is also implied that she holds an unrequited love for Tsubasa. She can control Girochi and induce some semblance of cooperation among the three other female Necks.\nHer mech, Yatsu no Onokoshizuchi, vaguely resembles a lightning demon in appearance, having no arms but an array of tentacles and a giant circle of electrodes on its back which fire deadly beams.\nIn personal contact, Miyako can make use of enchanted mirrors to create complex illusions and to spy on others over distances. She is a skilled manipulator and a keen observer.\nThere is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her throat.",
