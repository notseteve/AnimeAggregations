  "description" : "Galdino, alias Mr. 3 was a former officer agent of Baroque Works, alongside his partner Miss Goldenweek. He was the main antagonist of the Little Garden Arc, trying to simultaneously intercept the Straw Hats and capture the bounties on two giants but was soundly defeated. After being sent to Impel Down, he escaped with the assistance of Buggy the Clown, whom he shares a kindred bond with, and Monkey D. Luffy, an alliance that, while weak, proved itself on numerous occasions. He reluctantly took part in the Battle of Marineford alongside the other Impel Down escapees, proving to be a key component in the war`s climax. He is still shown to be with Buggy when he is reunited with his crew.",
