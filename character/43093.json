  "description" : "Glemy is a young man of average height, with blonde hair, and blue eyes, giving him an appearance similar to Char Aznable. Unlike the other soldiers of Neo Zeon, Glemy is honorable, chivalrous, and overall goofy. He condemns the use of underhanded strategies in battle, such as using hostages, and believes in refined manners, believing both men and women should act and behave in a sophisticated demeanor, while thinking lowly of those who do not. Glemy`s good nature also makes him very gullible, shown by him being deceived numerous times by others, on top of that his acts of chivalry more then often make him appear as a fool. Glemy has another side to him though; beneath his good and foolish demeanor he has shown that he can be heartless and manipulative. This was demonstrated by his manipulating of Elpeo Ple`s memories to make her a merciless soldier.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
