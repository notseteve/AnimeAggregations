After consulting eyewitness reports of wild Seadra, Goh went to the Houen region with Ash Ketchum. The two of them immediately started investigating the sea when they encountered Drake from the Houen region`s Elite Four, who they decided to work with. He provided them scuba diving equipment so Goh could dive deeper to clear the mission.",
