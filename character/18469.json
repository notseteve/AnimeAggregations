  "description" : "Ika Musume is a girl from the ocean who plans to invade humanity as punishment for the pollution done to the sea. However, after causing damage to the Lemon Beach House (which she planned to use as a base), she is forced to work as a waitress to pay for the damages.\nLike a squid, she has ten fully controllable blue tentacles that protrude from the top of her head like hair that can regenerate if they are cut off, as well as spew squid ink from her mouth. She also possesses numerous abilities from various species of squid, such as glowing in the dark like the firefly squid, moving the little fins on her \"hat\", breathing underwater, or changing her weight at will in order to better control her tentacles.\nAccording to Ika Musume, she will allegedly die if she takes her hat off.\nThis was made apparent http://anidb.net/e134836 [when she tried to force it off]; it caused her life to flash before her eyes.\nIka Musume enjoys shrimp and greatly fears natural predators of squids like sharks and killer whales (to the point that even swimming floats shaped like killer whales terrify her). Although generally immature and often getting herself into mischief, she is a fast learner, able to master complex things such as math and English in a short period of time. She almost always ends her sentences with \"de geso\" (でゲソ, lit. \"squid tentacles\") as a copula and emphasizes \"ika\" in sentences, which is written in katakana (e.g.:\"ja na ika\" (～じゃなイカ, lit. isn`t it?)). In the English dubs, she incorporates various squid and fish puns into her dialogue.\nSource: EN Wikipedia",
