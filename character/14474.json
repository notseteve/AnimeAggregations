  "description" : "The anime counterparts to the original Rowdyruff Boys, who first appeared in episode 20. Mojo Jojo broke into Professor Utonium`s lab in order to steal a sample of Chemical Z for his own purposes. While leaving the lab, Mojo Jojo stole Momoko`s curly straw, Miyako`s used cotton swab, and one of Kaoru`s smelly socks. Using a machine he recently created, Mojo poured the Chemical Z, the items he stole, and snips of his own hair. His machine exploded and the result was three boys containing Chemical Z, the DNA of the girls, and the evil black Chemical Z in Mojo`s hair: The Rowdyruff Boys. The boys now appear younger than the girls, at approximately 10 or 11 years of age and resemble a street gang. When they aren`t doing anything, the boys are often seen picking their noses, so as to offend their surroundings. Despite the fact that Mojo brought the boys to life, the Rowdyruff Boys do not have any respect for Mojo Jojo as well as the rest of Tokyo City. Instead of following their evil Mama, as the boys called Mojo, the Rowdyruff Boys do nothing but play pranks and cause trouble within Tokyo City for their own enjoyment. The only time they show any respect for Mojo Jojo is when they need him to destroy the Powerpuff Girls Z, which is really them abusing the parental love Mojo has for the boys. As expected, they have even less respect for the girls as the boys gross out and humiliate the girls with their pranks, flipping their skirts to grope them, mooning at them and calling them hags by the end of the episode. At the end of the episode, the boys abandon their Mama, no longer having any use for Mojo. They are each represented by a polygon in their color.",
