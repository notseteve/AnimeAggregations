  "description" : "Pansage is known as the Grass Monkey Pokémon. It is part of a trio that seems to be inspired by the three wise monkeys motif; with its mouth open, Pansage represents \"speak no evil\". Pansage lives in thick forests, and shares the leaves on its head with exhausted Pokémon. They have the effect of relieving from fatigue.\nIn the anime, Cilan owns a Pansage that first appeared along with Pansear and Panpour owned by Chili and Cress respectively. In the Pocket Monsters BW manga, Cilan uses a Pansage against Isamu Akai`s Clefairy in issue 3 when he tries to instigate a fight between Cilan, Chili, and Cress. In the Pokémon Master Black & White manga, Cheren uses a Pansage against Monta in a triple battle.\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated that its ability, Gluttony, \"almost makes up for the broccoli growing out of its head\". GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson commented that it was the most appealing of the three monkeys, design-wise. She also compared it to Eevee and its evolutions, due to each one being of a different type: grass, fire, and water.",
