  "description" : "Kaaya is an Oracle who specialises in defensive and healing spells. She meets Jil after he injures himself fighting a group of Climbers, and she takes him to her house and heals his wounds. He later joins her and Ahmey`s climber party. She uses a long wand which requires her to place small runes into a slot at the top and recite variating chants to perform certain spells. She is a descendant of Ki (pronounced \"Kai\"), who aided Gilgamesh in his battle against Druaga. Jil seemed to take a liking to her, and the two have seemed very close. Kaaya was even able to take advantage of Jil`s compassion for her in episode 8 to get her a mysterious stone slab.",
