  "description" : "A female commander that has an unstable personality. Chara`s mood swings are so constant that she sometimes goes out of control in a mobile suit battle. It is sometimes hard to tell what is unstable personality and what is merely a cover. There are times when she will act innocent and shy while in battle she is noticeably aggressive, confident, and unpredictable. When trying to get something from men she often uses \"feminine wiles\" to obtain it.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
