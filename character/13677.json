  "description" : "Tanuki is the Japanese word for the Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus). They have been part of Japanese folklore since ancient times. The legendary tanuki is reputed to be mischievous and jolly, a master of disguise and shapeshifting, but somewhat gullible and absent-minded.\nTanuki sometimes transforms into students of Peach Moon academy. She appeared in episode fourteen for the first time. Later, she became a member of the Intelligence Club as \"004\".\nWhen she transforms, she is not able to do this completely, which leaves all but her face looking like what she intended to transform into. However, there was one instance in the anime where she made a complete transformation. She also ends her sentences with \"Nyansu\".",
