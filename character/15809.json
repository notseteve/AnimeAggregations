  "description" : "A girl with short blonde hair and red eyes, whose undeveloped body, brash manners and manner of dressing make similar to a boy, she is a disciple to Shin`ichiro Ootori and a Qwaser herself, whose element is titanium, that she primarily wields in a massive double-handed greatsword she calls Excalibur, after the legendary blade from the Arthurian myth, which can not only cut through practically anything, but when drawn produces a deafening wail. Deeply loyal to her master, she bitterly followed him when he feigned treachery so as to draw the Qwaser of Gold out of hiding, where she provided defence for him by challenging Sasha, who however spared her life. After Ootori`s death she accepted Teresa as her partner and joined the ranks of Athos, thus becoming an ally to Sasha and his companions.",
