  "description" : "Biba Amatori, also known as the Liberator, is the leader of the Hunters and the eldest son of the Shogun.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch78930 [Mumei] addresses him as brother. She looks up to him to the point of idolatry, frequently quoting him and even talking to him in her sleep. She even goes so far as to hit http://anidb.net/ch81751 [Ikoma] and call him a liar when defending Biba against Ikoma`s accusations. However, Biba does not appear to genuinely reciprocate her affection, only praising her to use her. It is still possible that he does hold some admiration or respect, possibly affection for her unwavering loyalty and lack of hesitation.\nIt is revealed that he was betrayed by the Shogun in battle years ago and disowned for reasons yet unknown. The civilians don`t appear to know that he has been disowned, but he reveals this readily to the Koutetsujou cohort.\nSource: Koutetsujou no Kabaneri Wiki, edited.",
