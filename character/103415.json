  "description" : "While returning from a covert mission in the Sugi Village having stolen their kinjutsu Karai, Nigai and the Fourth Raikage are set upon by the mercenary Nokizaru Group who had been hired to retrieve the scroll. Though they fled, an Exploding Insect was implanted into them microscopically and after they berated the Raikage, an irate Nigai attacked the group only to explode. Following the same vein, Karai attacked them but stopped before he could be killed. Later, Amai, another comrade and medical-nin attempted to heal him but to no avail. Eventually, despite his initial protest, Tsunade was sought out to heal him, and the insect was removed by Shizune while Amai helped conduct the surgery.",
