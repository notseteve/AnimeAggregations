  "description" : "Rin is an orphan girl who finds http://anidb.net/ch10477 [Sesshomaru] in the woods after he is badly injured by InuYasha. Although Sesshomaru snubs her, she visits him regularly and attempts to take care of him, even stealing fish from the village for him until she learns that he doesn`t eat human food. The villagers beat her for the theft, but when Sesshomaru idly inquires about her injuries, she seems strangely happy about his interest in her welfare. During this time, she never speaks, only communicating with hand gestures and smiles.\nLater, the wolf-demon http://anidb.net/ch12169 [Kouga] chases a thief to her village, then lets his wolves kill and eat the villagers. Rin flees through the forest towards Sesshomaru, but the wolves catch up to her. Recovered from his wounds, Sesshomaru is leaving when he catches Rin`s scent and follows it to her mauled corpse. Remembering her smile, he retests Tenseiga by using it to resurrect her. After setting Rin on her feet again, Sesshomaru walks away, leaving the dumbfounded http://anidb.net/ch12163 [Jaken] and a wide-eyed Rin standing on the path. After a moment, they both follow. The next time Rin appears, she is clean, wearing a new, colourful kimono, and talking and acting more like a typical child. Throughout the series, she continues to follow \"Lord Sesshomaru\", as she calls him; when he is away on dangerous tasks, she waits for him with Jaken and a two-headed dragon which she names \"Ah-Un\".\nThough Sesshomaru never states any feelings for her, he displays a strong protective instinct and Rin is obviously devoted to him.",
