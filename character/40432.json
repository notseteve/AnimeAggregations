She met Cilan and explained her situation to him and he decided to help her find her Kibago. Ash and Iris ended up finding her missing Kibago as Ash initially thought it was Iris`s Axew.\nErina`s Axew traveled with Ash and Iris while they retraced its earlier location in case its trainer was there. Erina`s Axew accidentally mistook another Trainer to be Erina and got into a bit of trouble when it wouldn`t let go of the Trainer`s leg. Iris`s Emolga saw that the Trainer`s Kurumayu was attacking Erina`s Axew, so it shocked everyone in the subway car. Once they got off the train and apologize for the disturbance, they continued the search. They weren`t able to find Kibago`s trainer but Ash and Iris decided to leave a foot stamp of Erina`s Axew and post it. Erina saw the notice and with the help of Ash, Iris and Cilan, she was reunited with her Kibago.\nErina`s Axew didn`t use any moves in the episode.",
