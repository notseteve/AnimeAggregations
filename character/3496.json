  "description" : "He acts like a big brother or even a father to Angela. Mifune carries a giant holster full of katana with him wrapped in police tape saying `Keep Out`, along with a single one in a normal scabbard at his side. When his aura is visible in a later battle when he does not unwrap this tape (remaining around the holster) the `Keep Out` is visibly part of it, surrounding the sphere.",
