  "description" : "Teletha Testarossa serves as the fleet commander of the West Pacific Ocean Battle Group Tuatha de Danaan, which is under the command of the Combat Division of the secret military organization Mithril. While she is only 16 years old, she is a talent that is indispensable to the West Pacific Ocean Battle Group with her gift as a commander, rare intellect, pride, and competence to match. The delicate, yet gutsy manoeuvring she previously conducted off the coast of Khanka proved that she is an excellent commander and ship`s captain. There are none who harbour any doubts about her abilities. The name of the battle group \"Tuatha de Danaan\" comes from Celtic mythology and it means \"peoples of the goddess Danu\". The West Pacific Ocean Battle Group is a brave clan, who serve the goddess Tessa.",
