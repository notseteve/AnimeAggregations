  "description" : "Gentou is Haruka`s and Mika`s father. His last name is adopted from his wife`s family. His speech and conduct makes him seem like a member of the yakuza, though he is a loving parent who dotes on his daughters. He even bought an entire island for Haruka`s birthday. He is against Haruka hanging around Yuuto so much, though he does not mind having Yuuto around when he is alone. He heads the family`s private paramilitary strike force unit known as the Hell Hounds.",
