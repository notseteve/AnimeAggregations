  "description" : "Aria is the Demon Sword of Wind, she takes the shape of either a beautiful, young woman or a rapier. In her human form, she is typically light-hearted, romantic and very feminine. Her memories reach back to the Valbanil War and she was apparently born of a demon contract on a battlefield in that war. Through her experiences with Cecily, she becomes aware of other demon swords like her and becomes driven to learn why they are different. Her beauty and power provoke a strong desire to possess her in many around her. While she enjoys combat, sometimes goading Cecily into action, her past is filled with murder and treachery; carnage always follows close behind her. Cecily is the first to possess her who is opposed to wanton killing. She becomes fascinated with Cecily and the two form a powerful bond which enables both to become stronger. Her transformation into a sword is invoked with the chant \"Awaken, Grasp the Truth, Control the Wind and Slay God\" (\"Nemuri wo Hodoke, Shinzitsu wo tsukame, Kaze wo kono te ni, Kami wo Korose\").",
