  "description" : "Isone Kotoha is a sixteen years old high school student who was once a human before she was striked at a very young age. Because of that event she became a Hanyou, half youkai and half human. She is a Language-user (Kotodama Tsukai) who can summon things when she emphasises words. She can conjure up weapons or objects by saying one word, however there are certain objects where she needs to use a lengthy spell in order to conjure it up.\nSource: Wikipedia",
