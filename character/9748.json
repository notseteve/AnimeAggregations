  "description" : "Tamaki Maiko (nicknamed \"Tama\" by her friends; \"Tamago Musume\" = \"egg-girl\" is a wordplay on her name) is a childhood friend of the http://anidb.net/ch9745 [unnamed protagonist]. Her attitude towards him is expressed by her own word creation \"Madako\" that she hopes him to say to her (\"Mai-chan, dai-suki, koi shiteru\" = \"Mai-chan, I like you, I love you\") which she even writes on the blackboard in their classroom. Maiko is carefree and slightly immature, energetic and loud (e. g. in the karaoke box). She loves strawberry milk and ice cream since kindergarten; despite having a slim body she has a complex about her bottom (and is jealous of http://anidb.net/ch19484 [Marufuji Izumi]`s body because of this). She considers the protagonist her property and is known for spasms of jealousy in public when some \"tit monster\" (i. e. an adult woman) gets too close to him. She frequently sleeps during class, thus being an endless source of frustration for http://anidb.net/ch39723 [Shimizu-sensei]. Her curiosity of all things paranormal makes her interested in the rumors of shadow beings recently having appeared in town.\nActually Maiko died during the downfall of human society; her current existence in this world is merely a memory of the protagonist revived by the means of the http://anidb.net/ch39798 [Pandora Project].",
