  "description" : "Sekidousai is a wizard of terrible power, who has managed to live well over 400 years. Of late, he has been forced to go into hiding inside a painting he made when he lost his powers, but he has already made plans to revive himself. Sekidousai is the ancestor of http://anidb.net/ch10271 [Karina Shirou], who bears a striking resemblance to him. The main external difference is that Sekidousai has a different hairstyle and white-blond hair. The characters of the two men are diametrically opposed; where Karina is a defender of justice and an agent of the law, Sekidousai`s main desire is to create a world without restrictions, where all can live according to their very darkest desires. In addition, Sekidousai is a voluntary exhibitionist.\nDuring his long life, Sekidousai created several powerful items:\nThe book which caused the rising of the `demon` in the first episode of Inukami, which can apparently also reflect attacks made against its bearer.\nThe mechanical rooster Socrates, which can change the clothing of people within a certain range to match the strongest desires of a person in its vicinity.\nA robot oddly named Xanthippe, whose main weapon is a drill, set in its groin.\nThe Daisakkai, which appears to be a kind of magical computer that initially serves to govern the world inside Sekidousai`s painting refuge. Later, it manages Sekidousai`s stolen energies. Daisakkai`s ultimate purpose is to use the energies it receives to grant any single wish.",
