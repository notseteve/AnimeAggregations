Hei`s \"mundane identity\" is a gentle-hearted student from China named Li Shun Sheng (李舜生 (リ・シュンシェン), Ri ShunShen), but when \"working\" he takes on the role of a seemingly (at first) affectless and ruthless killer nicknamed \"The Black Reaper\"; this alias was earned based on stories of BK-201`s accomplishments as an assassin during the war at Heaven`s Gate.\nSource: Wikipedia",
