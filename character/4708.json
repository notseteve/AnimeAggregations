  "description" : "A pretty girl with a palatial estate, Class President Ayaka might seem like a girl to be envied! But a lot of her peers don`t know the sadness she holds in her heart after the loss of a family member early in life. Ayaka`s lifelong rival Asuna knows her secret and surprisingly takes steps to bring some joy into the blonde`s life. Of course, that joy also comes with a visit from a rambunctious group of junior high girls who end up wreaking havoc at her fancy home.
