  "description" : "Skyla`s Unfezant seems to be Skyla second most powerful Pokémon. People call Skyla`s Unfezant the heaven-racing meteor as swings its head plumage to threaten opponents. Skyla believes that her Unfezant is very powerful against Bug or Fire types as she would give it the victory in her Gym air battles.\nBattle against Cilan\nSkyla`s Unfezant was matched up against Cilan`s Pansage in Skyla`s air battle and she believed that her Unfezant would be victorious. In the actual gym battle, Skyla`s Swoobat was replaced by Skyla`s Unfezant. It didn`t fare too well against Cilan`s Crustle as Rock Wrecker hit its mark once again. Skyla`s Unfezant`s Air Slash then proved to be ineffective against Cilan`s Crustle rock. Skyla`s Unfezant was then knocked out by a combination of Cilan`s Crustle`s Shell Smash and X-Scissor to give Cilan the lead in the battle.\nBattle against Ash\nIn Skyla air battle simulation, Ash`s Tranquill was matched up against Skyla`s Unfezant and since her Pokémon was the highest evolved form, she determined that her Pokémon would be the winner in that match-up. In the actual gym battle, Ash`s Tranquill was up against Skyla`s Unfezant which was the match-up just after Ash`s Tranquill had defeated Skyla`s Swoobat. Skyla`s Unfezant proved to be stronger and faster than Ash`s Tranquill, so Ash recalled it and set out Pikachu. Pikachu had a definite advantage over Skyla`s Unfezant with its electric attacks and it quickly knocked it out with its Electro Ball attack.",
