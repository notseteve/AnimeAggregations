  "description" : "Describing himself as a minor god, Koma is a komainu, although he used the literal meaning of his kind`s name to pass for a tengu when he inhabited the Mapputatsu shrine. Although she had never actually seen him, Isafuyu used to borrow his powers whenever she needed to exorcise demons, and took Kunieda to his abode when she requested assistance in this regard.",
