  "description" : "The only daughter of a Navy official, it is through Komo that the army discovers the kids` involvement with Zearth. She was Maki`s best friend since childhood. At first Komo was rather quiet and bored by the world, preferring to read and play the piano alone, and secretly wondering if her father would have preferred a son instead. But as the time of her battle draws near, she goes outside to observe the world more closely and comes to appreciate how lively and beautiful it is.",
