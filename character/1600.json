  "description" : "The fourth member of the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance] is a collective formed by the nations of southern Africa. Unlike the Alliance`s other member nations, the South African Union was not a sponsor of the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANT] construction project, and thus has no economic stake in the conflict. Instead, its participation in the war appears to have been motivated by its antagonism towards the PLANT-aligned African Community. However, the South African Union has fared badly in the fighting, and is now in the process of dropping out.",
