  "description" : "Drakloak is a dual-type Dragon/Ghost Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves from Dreepy starting at level 50 and evolves into Dragapult starting at level 60.\nDrakloak is a Pokémon which resembles a lizard, with a wide, black-colored head with two vertical horns and several red triangle-shaped sports on the sides. It has yellow eyes, while the underside of its mouth is light blue. The rest of its body is also light blue, while its belly is yellow with a red, upside-down V-shaped spot. It has short, stubby arms and legs and a long tail.\nDrakloak is capable of flying at speeds greater than 120 mph (193.121 kmh). It carries a Dreepy on its head, which it takes care of and fights alongside until the Dreepy manages to evolve. If it lacks a Dreepy to care for, it will become uneasy and desperately try to find any Pokémon to serve as a substitute to take care of.",
