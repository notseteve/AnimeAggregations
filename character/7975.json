  "description" : "Berthier is the second youngest sister. Her name is French, coming from the mineral berthierite. She fears Rubeus but has no love interest for him unlike her other sisters.\nBerthier has a very darkly playful personality, but is shown to have great respect for all of her siblings. Much like her counterpart in Ami, she is also a strategist and is incredibly talented at chess.\nHer attack is Dark Water, which is a stream of freezing water which surrounded her and was then blasted towards the enemy.\nSource: wiki",
