  "description" : "A lady with an unknown age human woman with blonde hair who was already part of Harlock`s crew at the time Tadashi came aboard, Kei was rescued by Harlock when he raided a ship that was transporting her as a prisoner back to Earth following an assault by her upon a military officer who had belittled her father`s death. She initially seems to have a crush towards Tadashi Daiba, though the two eventually settle into a platonic friendship. In later additions to the franchise, she is instead portrayed as romantically inclined towards Harlock himself. She is the Arcadia`s chief navigator and science officer, and she is the second-youngest crew member after Tadashi.\nSource: MAL",
