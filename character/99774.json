  "description" : "Hirokawa Uzuki is the leader of the http://anidb.net/character/99773 [Sweet Bullet] group that Nodoka`s a member of. Her fans lovingly call her \"Zukki.\" Always doing things on her own time and down-to-earth, she often surprises those around her with unexpected words and actions. For better or worse, she can`t read the air and acts very close to even people she`s just met. Normally hyper, she has a cheerful personality.\nSource: Official page",
