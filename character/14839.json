  "description" : "A former Captain in the Carabinieri, discharged due to a leg injury, he was approached by Jean Croce to serve as Claes` handler. In return, Jean would ensure Raballo`s reinstatement to the Carabinieri after three years. During his time in Section 2, Raballo and Claes partook of activities outside the SWA, especially fishing. He also taught Claes the value of patience and rekindled her prior love of reading. However, some incidents led him to question the cyborg program and the way the girls were being used. He left the agency and contacted a friend who was a newspaper reporter, but Raballo was then killed — in a rather fortuitous hit-and-run. Since bonding with another handler was impractical, Claes was simply re-conditioned to forget about Raballo and take part in simple everyday activities like gardening or testing new improvements to cyborg development. When circumstances led her to take part in the capture of two suspects she was reluctant since she had promised to be good — though she could not remember to whom she had made the promise to.\nSource: Wikipedia",
