  "description" : "The Asuka II originally began service as a standard-power aircraft carrier with Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. However the vessel was transferred to operations with the U.N. Forces by the Japanese unification government upon joining the U.N. government. Asuka II was then completed as a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and deployed as the de facto mobile base of first VF-0 special duty combat test unit (Skull Team) in 2008. In addition, engineers assigned to the VF-0 development and maintenance were transferred aboard the Asuka II to maintain these difficult units.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/asuka.htm",
