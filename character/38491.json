  "description" : "Shinohara Misao is a classmate of Sasami and they become friends in the first episode. She is an introvert whose shyness manifests as worm-like creatures around her whenever she gets scared. They also envelop her body, making her scary to those around her. It is only after meeting Sasami that she becomes more outgoing. Except for the bow on her hair and her hair being more blue than purplish black, she resembles her counterpart in the http://anidb.net/a1075 [Pretty Sammy] series, Amano Misao.\nSource: wiki",
