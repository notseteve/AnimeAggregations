  "description" : "Minori is the Principal and P.E teacher of the Tenbi Academy. She`s the one that allowed Inaho, Kodama, and Haruno to all live under the same roof with Takeru.\nShe brandishes incredible power and control over Element, and she can break through amazingly powerful barriers with her bare hands thanks to nothing more than, in her own words, her \"fighting spirit\". She was in the Maken-ki of the school before it became an all-girls academy.\nShe refers to herself as \"Minori-chan\" most of the time. Her Maken is a pair of gauntlets called \"Dragon Ace\".",
