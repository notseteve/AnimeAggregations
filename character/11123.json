  "description" : "This experimental amphibious mobile suit could almost be characterized as a mobile gun platform. The Zock`s huge body houses a battery of mega particle cannons, which can fire both forward and backward. Incapable of walking on its vestigial legs, it moves by hovering, or in jet-assisted jumps. One prototype Zock is used in Char Aznable`s assault on the Federation Forces`s Jaburo base.",
