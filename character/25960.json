  "description" : "Archer, the King of Heroes, Gilgamesh, is summoned to the 4th Holy Grail War was the Servant of http://anidb.net/ch25942 [Toosaka Tokiomi], but eventually joins forces with http://anidb.net/ch1916 [Kotomine Kirei]. He survives the 4th Holy Grail War and stays as pretty much of a rogue Servant throughout the 10 years between the 4th and 5th Holy Grail Wars, and takes part in the latter as an 8th, irregular Servant. He dislikes the presence of http://anidb.net/ch38 [Saber] and http://anidb.net/ch25952 [Rider] in particular, since both were kings like he was, but he lusts towards Saber and spares no effort to add her to his endless list of belongings. Much to Tokiomi`s displeasure, Archer has difficulty acting covertly, since he has a strong tendency to show off, and he has trouble regaining his temper when his enormous pride is wounded.",
