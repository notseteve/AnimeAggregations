  "description" : "Her sorcery name Intimus115, \"Everything I offer to my lost friend\". A member of Necessarius and a talented \"Decoder\", she has tanned skin and wears a black Gothic Lolita dress. Her blonde hair is unkempt and according to Tsuchimikado, she has the silhouette of a lion. She is a master of Kabbalah Statue art and utilizes oil pastel or chalk to draw a spell to summon a golem Sherry refers to as \"Ellis\".\nSherry appears in Academy City with the intention of attacking a person of importance to either Academy City or Necessarius in order to cause a conflict- and eventually, war- between the two factions. During her assault, she reveals to Toma that she seeks to keep science and magic divided as revenge for her late friend Ellis, an esper from Academy City. Ellis was involved in a secret experiment between Academy City and Necessarius in an attempt to create the first magician-esper hybrid. But it went horribly wrong as not only did the espers participants suffered major injuries from magic but were killed by the Knights of England as the experiment was illegal under the truce between Science and Magic. Blaming both sides for letting Ellis suffered and killed, Sherry swore revenge against them by making them suffered like she did.",
