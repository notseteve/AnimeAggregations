  "description" : "The protagonist, he is extremely strong and fights using a quarterstaff made of black crystal. Has the word \"baka\" (idiot) scribbled across his forehead by Aun in black ink as he was trying to lead her back home. He`s also able to withstand even the strongest blasts of Aho energy, even when its focused directly on him. It was later revealed that he was the source of the un-Aho, which is the reason why Aun`s stasis field has no effect on him. Since he was angry at Aun for writing the word idiot in permanent ink, he inscribed the same word on Keyne`s forehead, inadvertently marrying her in the process. Though he is simple-minded, he is very trustworthy and loyal to those he promises to protect.",
