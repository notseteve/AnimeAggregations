She had died young without making any friends and this strong wish to become close with someone is what has kept her clinging to life. She was about to be used by http://anidb.net/ch138819 [Kasha] who had promised that her wish will come true if she becomes an ayakashi and kills the http://anidb.net/ch148451 [Guardian of the Momochi House]. In the end she was saved by Himari who declared that they are indeed friends. She thanked Himari and dissapeared soon after, having reached a state of peace, possibly going to the afterlife.",
