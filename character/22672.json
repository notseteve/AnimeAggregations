  "description" : "Rudy is the Gym Leader of the Trovita Island Gym which is a gym located on an island just off the coast of Trovitopolis. Any trainer who can pass his `attack test` and defeat in in a Pokémon battle will earn the Spike Shell Badge.\nWhen Rudy battled Ash, the rules were that Rudy would choose Pokémon of the same type as Ash. So Rudy`s Electabuzz went up against Pikachu, Exeggutor against Bulbasaur and Starmie against Squirtle. Rudy has a Pokémon in his gym that would cover every Pokémon type except ghost (and the new types added in the Gold & Silver generation).\nRudy uses dancing techniques to improves a Pokémon footwork and agility. Rudy himself also enjoys to dance.\nRudy`s younger sister lives on Trovita Island along with Rudy and a few additional trainers.",
