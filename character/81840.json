  "description" : "One of a vampire-like race, the Crimson Nobles, she and Loretta make their living stealing and treasure-hunting. She seems to have a slight crush on Sheyanne, though that might be because she (and every other Crimson Noble) finds his blood incredibly delicious. Crimson Nobles have the ability to transform into strange bat-like creatures, and Mirabelle often transforms easily between the two forms, though others have remarked on her slow flying.",
