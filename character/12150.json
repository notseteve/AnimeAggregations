  "description" : "Ryuugamine Mikado is a first year high school boy who moved to Ikebukuro with the encouragement of his best friend, http://anidb.net/ch12151 [Kida Masaomi]. He moved in order to search for unusual beings and adventure. His greatest fear is having a normal life. Mikado tries hard to change his image but so far he has not had any luck, although he does get up enough courage to become the Class Representative along with http://anidb.net/ch12155 [Anri]. Mikado has had moments where he speaks his mind, and Masaomi claims to admire this about him. He is the only remaining creator of the infamous http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars] and also its leader. He seems to be infatuated with Anri Sonohara, but has never found a chance to tell her. Whenever he is close to confessing, she leaves. Mikado often gets advice from http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Izaya], particularly in relation to the Dollars and his need to seek out a life that isn`t ordinary.\nHis online chat screenname is \"Tanaka Taro\".",
