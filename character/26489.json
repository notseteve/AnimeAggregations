  "description" : "Issa Shuzen is Moka`s stepfather and the head of the Shuzen Family, which is well-known and respected as far as China for its reputation of dealing with \"problems\" in the underground. It is also the only location in Japan that houses vampires. Upon Akua`s arrival to the mansion from China, he orders her and Kalua to kill each other so that he may test his eldest daughter`s strength. He stops the fight before either one becomes badly injured, however, having measured her ability to his satisfaction.\nIssa makes a full appearance in Rosario + Vampire Capu2 and is the third Dark Lord. In this adaptation, he created Moka`s rosario and the one used for the school barrier. His contempt for humans knows no bounds and according to Komori, and his powers exceed that of a standard S-class youkai, able to throw anyone with just a wave of his hand.",
