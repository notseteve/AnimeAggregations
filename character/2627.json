  "description" : "Dr. Namba is a scientist of Team Rocket.\nHe first appeared in the Lugia saga that comprised of \"The Mystery is History\", \"A Parent Trapped\" and \"A Promise is a Promise\". He has since appeared in number of episodes giving Butch and Cassidy their mission briefings, though this was only as a vocal role in all except \"Oaknapped\". He is believed to be in his 50s or 60s. His name is often mispronounced, and he has a short temper.\nLittle is known about Namba. It can be speculated that since he does order scientists and agents within Team Rocket, he is either very knowledgeable about his field or that he has been with the group for a while, climbing the corporate ladder at Team Rocket. Also, in the Japanese version of his appearances on Pokémon Chronicles, Namba demands Butch and Cassidy to capture rare Pokémon for something he calls the `R Project.`\nAside from the already mentioned fact of him ordering a cadre of scientists and agents, two notable agents that he orders are Butch and Cassidy.",
