  "description" : "Yukine is the quiet, shy, and faithful personal servant of Maria, with her quiet and shy demeanor hiding a very talented skillset. Yukine acts as Maria`s primary information-gatherer, and the two of them are able to figure out that Kenshi is the Seikijin pilot that attacked Lashara. There is a clear mutual attraction between Kenshi and Yukine, and merely being in close proximity to each other can cause their cheeks to color. She is from a clan that protects a temple dedicated to the Choushin and even lets Kenshi compress it into a sword. Her Seikijin is a mixture of light colors with moth antennae and a mane armed with a railgun and jets that allows her to travel at supersonic speeds.",
