Maria Ross] for the murder of http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Brigadier General Maes Hughes]. Douglas reappears after http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang] apparently burns Ross to an ashy skeleton, admonishing the Flame Alchemist for letting personal issues take him to such an extreme and stating that, thanks to the excessive damage, the identity of the corpse cannot be confirmed. He reappears in Chapter 35 when Roy and http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Lt. Hawkeye] attempt to confuse the Military Police as to http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar]`s whereabouts so as to help http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric lure out the Homunculi. In Chapter 98, Douglas leads a platoon of Central troops to the gates of Central Command in order to provide backup to http://anidb.net/ch10175 [FÃ¼hrer King Bradley] in his solo battle against Briggs troops and the Homunculus Greed. However, before Douglas` squad can make any headway, the Colonel himself is knocked out by a blow to the back of the head from http://anidb.net/ch10405 [Fuu].",
