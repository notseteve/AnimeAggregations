He is currently searching for the vampire twins and, like his younger brother, He is a treasure hunter, not a vampire hunter like originally believed. His abilities include summoning Oni to fight for him. He is able to perform these abilities with the help one of Sakura`s feathers, which Shaoran failed to retrieve in their encounter in Ooto country. An experienced fighter, Seishirou was also the one to teach Shaoran his kicking techniques, and apparently can kick just as well.",
