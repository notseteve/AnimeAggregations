  "description" : "Denny Brosh and http://anidb.net/ch10166 [Maria Ross] are introduced when they are assigned to protect http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward Elric]. While Brosh is rather nosy and lazy, and has an enormous infatuation with Ross, Ross is serious with her job, to the point that she develops a maternal affection for Edward when she is protecting him. In the manga, Ross is framed by the homunculi for the death of http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes]. http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] stages a prison break and then fakes her death, giving her a chance to flee to Xing. Before leaving, she asks that her family and Brosh not be told that she is alive so as to keep the secret from getting out. To repay Mustang for saving her life, Ross later returns to Amestris and helps him wage an assault on Central. In the first anime, Brosh and Ross later appear in the rebellion against http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley], saving various characters from execution.",
