  "description" : "An uninvited assistant to Kain. Jealous of Canal, Millie is a happy-go-lucky girl who is a self-professed, but amateur private detective. She has very basic detective skills such as opening a locked door with her hair pin. At work, she is very skilled at shooting all weapons... but at home on Sword-Breaker, she is very clumsy in the kitchen. Providing a bit of comedy, she routinely ruins the kitchen and the dishes on a regular basis. Her dream is to be the best in the universe at everything she does.",
