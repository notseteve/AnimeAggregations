  "description" : "Vice Head Chef of the Bishoku-kai, has a currently unexplained ability to roast things by touching them. His name is sometimes pronounced Star-Jun, he is not one to mince words and will admit his mistakes. He appears to be noble, or at least respectful to those he considers strong, since in his fight with Toriko he set the GT Robo`s pain sensors to 100% to test and feel Toriko`s maximum power. Later he claims that it would be difficult to not test Toriko. He has a habit of scratching his head with one finger. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members that Alfaro says are capable of entering the Gourmet World.",
