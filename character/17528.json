  "description" : "She seems to have romantic feelings for Kio but is actually a member of the special branch of the Japanese immigration office. She possesses the unique ability to warp in weaponry as needed and is dispatched on missions that range from dealing with oversea smugglers (as seen in the action-packed opening scenes) to eliminating alien threats and those who harbor them. What`s more, she`s like a completely different person when it comes to business, so much that she`ll scare the crap out of her messenger for making remarks about her and Kio. She apparently has the uncanny ability to come out of any situation alive and unscathed too, earning her the nickname Akuuon Momiji 「悪運紅葉」 that is feared by many. Akuuon means bad luck (for those who cross her path), whereas Momiji describes the colour of leaves changing in fall.",
