  "description" : "Gin`s most distinguishing characteristic is his expression; with his slitted eyes and ever-present grin, his face looks like that of a fox. Ichigo derisively nicknames him \"fox-face\" in their first meeting because of this (in the English dub, he instead replies with a more generalised insult). He also has unusual silver hair, which has a purple tint. Gin`s constant happy fa√ßade tends to have the opposite effect on those he meets, making them instantly distrust him. His use of sarcasm only further encourages this, especially in those who have known him for a long time.",
