  "description" : "A pure white MS produced by the \"UC Project,\" part of the Federation Space Force`s reorganization plan. The entire movable frame of this experimental machine forms a psycoframe, and its responsiveness is extremely high. It also incorporates a special \"Laplace Program\" OS and a system known as \"NT-D (Newtype Drive, called Newtype Destroyer System by Full Frontal).\" When NT-D is activated, the internal frame expands and the entire figure is transformed. In the process, the armor separates along its seams, and slides are released. A red glow can be seen where the internal frame is exposed by the gaps in the armor, and this is believed to be a psycoframe luminescence phenomenon. The machine`s performance, in particular its mobility, is dramatically increased when NT-D is active. In its normal mode, it sports a head resembling that of mass-produced MS like the GM. Equiped with beam magnum, hyper bazooka, NT-D type shield, four beam saber and beam gatling gun as an option.",
