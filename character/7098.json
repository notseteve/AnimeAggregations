  "description" : "Karin is descended from a long line of purebred vampires; however, Karin has an unusual issue. Instead of suffering from the lack of blood which plagues most normal vampires, Karin`s blood is overproduced, especially when those around her are feeling unhappy. When Karin`s blood increases to the point that she can no longer hold it, she must either bite someone, or suffer a nosebleed. This physical anomaly also enables Karin to walk unharmed in sunlight, attend school, and hold a day job at a small restaurant entitled \"Julian`s\". Unfortunately, this also comes with a lack of other vampiric traits that further separates her from the rest of her family, including human-level senses, strength and the lack of ability to summon familiars or erase human memory. If Karin fails to bite someone and holds in her blood, preventing a nosebleed, she will enter a berserker-like mindset. While in this state, she will aggressively seek a target for blood injection and she displays more classic vampire traits that she wouldn`t normally have. She has demonstrated strength, speed and possibly enhanced senses and the ability to use chi or else vampiric powers to fling a target away. She has been shown twice in such a state.",
