  "description" : "Misha introduced herself to Cilan who was waiting for his friends to return from going inside the mine. She said she was looking for her Choroneko who had gone missing. She injured her arm in an accident and went to the hospital to get it mended and when she returned her Choroneko was gone. Cilan told her that he had seen a Choroneko and it was with his friends in the mine, so the two of them went to meet up with them in the mine.\nWhen Misha saw her Choroneko, she immediately recognized it and quickly went over to get it but Choroneko brought out its claws and looked as if it would hurt her if she attempted to go further. Meowth was able to translate what Misha`s Purrloin`s was saying and it indicated that it thought it had been abandoned. Misha explained to her Choroneko that she`d been injured and wasn`t able to return as quickly as she`d hoped.\nWhen Ash and his friend were beginning to fall into the rocks, she came over to help pull the rope with Cilan but the metal girting collapsed below them and they fell in as well. Misha`s Purrloin went to get help from the flock of Tranquill and they were able to rescue everyone. Misha`s Purrloin had a change of heart and was reunited with Misha.",
