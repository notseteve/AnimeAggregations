She has secretly taken possession of one of her finds, the Star Compass, which she hopes to use in her exploration of the Abyss.\nHer need for glasses results from an effect from the Curse of the Abyss, which she caught while her then-pregnant mother went on a descent and Riko was born inside the Abyss.\nSource: Wikipedia",
