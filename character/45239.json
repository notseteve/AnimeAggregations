  "description" : "A new mass production design which beat out the competing AMX-011 Zaku III during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf is found to be much more powerful and contemporary than its competition by the Neo Zeon military. Using design concepts taken from the salvaged Titans` mobile suit MRX-010 Psyco Gundam Mark II, the Dooben-Wolf incorporates a wide variety of beam weapons all over its body, including wire-guided remote beam gun forearms and wire-guided remote \"incom\" beam guns, all controlled by a \"quasi-psycommu\" computer control system. These features allow a normal, non-Newtype pilot to conduct all-range attacks similar to those made by a Newtype pilot using a standard psycommu system. In addition to its plethora of beam weapons, the Dooben-Wolf also mounts missile launchers, grenade launchers, and vulcan guns for additional firepower. However, its primary armament is its high-powered beam rifle, which can be connected directly to the mega particle guns in its abdomen and fired as an even more powerful \"mega launcher\" weapon. All of these weapons and features help to make the Dooben-Wolf one of the single most powerful mobile suit designs developed during the First Neo Zeon War. Many of the Dooben-Wolf units produced are operated by pilots working for Glemy Toto`s anti-Haman Karn faction during Neo Zeon`s internal conflicts near the end of the war.\nSource: mahq.net",
