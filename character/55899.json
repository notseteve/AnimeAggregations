  "description" : "Introduced in Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, she was the first Sister clone Mikoto met. While she was similar to the other clones, 9982 had a rather unusual personality, as she was very interested in the outside world. She was very snarky to people, often giving long detailed critiques on their taste in food. The one thing that she desired was to meet her older sister, Mikoto, the girl whom she was cloned from. Upon their first meeting, the two had an awful start due 9982`s refusal to reveal to Mikoto what the Sisters were involved in, but they both later bonded somewhat after Mikoto gave her a Gekota badge.\nSadly, the meeting would be their last as 9982 was scheduled to fight Accelerator that day. Despite being horribly beaten, including having her leg ripped off, 9982 appreciated the time she spent with Mikoto in her last moments. She died, crushed by a passenger car thrown by Accelerator, still clutching the first and only gift she received from Mikoto.",
