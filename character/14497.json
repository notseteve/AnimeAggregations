  "description" : "The reincarnation of Seiryuu the Azure Dragon of the East (Spring). He is the leader of the Saint Beasts and the most powerful. He is heterochromatic (his right eye is blue while his left is red).\nIn Tenshi no Shippo: He is the last Saint Beast to appear, and his reappearance frightens even the goddess, who accidentally drops her staff in fear. He takes Yuki as his bride, since Oriental dragons, which Seiryu is commonly depicted as, are serpentine. He is clearly in love with Yuki, as she is with him. Sacred Power: Fang (Sword) of the Blue Dragon. Lightning Blast.\nIn Saint Beast: Gou is the oldest of the Saint Beasts (the four Saint Beast calls him Anija which means older brother) and tends to be very serious and in charge of the missions given to him by the Goddess. He has a deep friendship with Gai.\nAttribute: Fire\nAbility: Manipulating nature\nAttack: Fire Beam\nImage Color: Blue",
