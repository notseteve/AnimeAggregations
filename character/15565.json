  "description" : "A pretty female Muglox (with a height of 9.5 cm) who is Setsu`s partner. She loves Mirumo and wants to marry him, much to his disappointment. She is Mirumo`s fianc√©e, and tries to get along with Mirumo on dates. At times, she may look very cute and innocent, but she can actually be quite aggressive. Rirumu is not exactly the champion when it comes to magic and household chores, and she even makes magical situations worse if she \"helps.\" She cooks food for Mirumo, but instead of Mirumo eating it, he keeps avoiding her because of the food`s appearance and taste (they all look weird and inedible). She uses a tambourine as her magic tool. Her favorite dessert is cream puffs. She marries Mirumo in the final chapter of the manga.",
