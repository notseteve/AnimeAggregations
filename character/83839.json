  "description" : "Wulfric is the Gym Leader of the Snowbelle Gym located in Snowbelle City in Kalos. He specializes in using Ice-type Pokémon and trainers that defeat him receive the Iceberg Badge. He finds cold temperatures just right for his body temperature.\nSawyer (Scottie) defeated Wulfric in a heated battle a few days before Ash showed up for his gym battle.\nAsh challenged Wulfric for his final badge and Wulfric noted that this gym battle would determine if he`d get his 8th and final badge. He told Ash that Ice is both extremely hard and terribly fragile at the same time and that the choice of Pokémon he decided to use would affect his battle strength.",
