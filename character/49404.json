  "description" : "Norman is an attendant at a bridge that goes to Sunny Town but the bridge is only for cars and bicycles. He informed Ash and his friends that the bridge is over 10 miles long but a section was still under construction. He then explained to them that the bicycle path was completed so they could get across that way but it would be dark before they reached the other side.",
