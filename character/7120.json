She tends to be jealous of girls that have big breasts compared to her own and angry with guys that prefer such girls. She has no romantic attachments, and seems to think that she would need to change her personality to something more \"girly\" in order to have a successful romantic relationship with a male. Like most of the others she likes to physically hurt Ikkou on a daily basis but it is hinted that she still likes him in the second season.",
