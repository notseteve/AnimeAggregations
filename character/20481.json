  "description" : "The younger of the Anarchy sisters, Stocking is a violet-haired goth girl with a gluttonous appetite for sweet desserts. She is generally more level-headed and intelligent than Panty, although she can be just as rude as her sister when provoked. She also does not share her sister`s interest in sex, though she occasionally displays masochistic tendencies such as bondage and electrocution. She does not gain weight from eating sugary foods, allowing her to eat desserts to her heart`s content. Due to her obsession with sweets, she becomes enraged whenever someone tampers with them or calls her overweight. Her stockings transform into a pair of katanas, \"Stripes I & II\". She is almost always seen carrying around a plush cat, Honekoneko (lit. \"Bone Kitten\"), whose expressions often match Stocking`s mood. As the first season ended, Stocking was able to return to Heaven, but returned to Earth to help Panty defeat Corset (with some `celestial help`). However, she kills Panty on their way back to the chapel, revealing herself to be a demon.",
