  "description" : "Awayuki Natsue is a wealthy and powerful executive who married her teenage crush Kaoru after her divorce. She only exposes her soft-side to Kaoru while dealing with everyone else with a strict decorum. Her daughters are named after characters in her favorite book by Kaoru, Twin Princesses. Natsue is consumed by jealousy of her husband`s ex-wife and of Himeno, treating the girl more harshly than her own daughters. Her hatred results in her being possessed by the Princess of Disaster. In the anime, Natsue is never possessed by the Princess of disaster, never shows any jealousy about Kaoru`s late wife, and while strict with Himeno, also cares about her wellbeing.",
