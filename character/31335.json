  "description" : "Toki-san is Kotomi`s first high school friend. Toki looks and sounds like a delinquent, but in reality, she is clumsy and shows no signs of a rebellious nature; in fact, the only reason she leaves her shirt loose was because she accidentally tucked it inside her underwear one day and was embarrassed about it. She is a bit scatterbrained as she gets lost and arrives late when meeting up with Kotomi.\nSource: Wiki",
