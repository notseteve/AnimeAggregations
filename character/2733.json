  "description" : "An elite branch of the Federation Forces created in the aftermath of Operation Stardust. The Titans are charged with hunting down the renegade soldiers of the Principality of Zeon, and suppressing anti-Federation movements, but their overzealous actions soon create a new generation of resistance groups. The Titans are initially headquartered at the Gryps space colony, but as they gain control over the regular Federation Forces and form an alliance with the Republic of Zeon, they also take over Luna II and the Gate of Zedan.",
