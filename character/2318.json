  "description" : "A rather serious student who is also into astronomy, Matagu seems to be the most hopeless of the cast, a classic `nerd`, never even getting to the point of gaining a girlfriend by the end of the series. He is much less confident and self-assured than Hyosuke, or even Kei, leading one to conclude that he suffers from crippling shyness. His stated fondest dream is to meet with `an alien creature from outer space`, totally unaware of the fact that his teacher certainly qualifies as such, and that he has had several conversations with his life`s dream in a very normal setting.",
