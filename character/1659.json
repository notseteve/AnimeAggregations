  "description" : "The new leader of http://anidb.net/ch1579 [Blue Cosmos], and a member of the secret society of military industrialists known as http://anidb.net/ch1578 [Logos]. Djibril and his fellow Logos members manipulate world affairs from behind the scenes using the nations of the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance], and in particular the http://anidb.net/ch1594 [Atlantic Federation], as their puppets. After the fall of Junius Seven, Djibril seizes on this disaster as a pretext for war against the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs], but his burning hatred for Coordinators drives him to escalate the conflict faster than even his fellow Logos members are comfortable with.",
