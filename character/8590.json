  "description" : "The GNX-704T/AC Mr. Bushido`s Ahead (aka Sakigake) is a GNX-704T Ahead customized for close combat for Mr. Bushido, one of the A-Laws` most elite pilots. In keeping with the pilot`s apparent obsession with Japanese samurai culture, his Ahead resembles an armoured samurai, down to its main armament (a pair of beam sabers styled after a katana and wakizashi).\nThe cable behind its head is for providing extra energy to whichever weapons it might use. But due to its inconvenience in connecting and disconnecting, there is a special GN condenser mounted in its shield, for recharging of the extra-powerful saber.\nThe thrusters on the Ahead`s shoulders are usually horizontal, but Mr. Bushido has made them vertical for reducing interference with the swinging of the Ahead`s arms.",
