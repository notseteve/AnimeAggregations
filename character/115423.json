  "description" : "Coco / Koko`s name can romanized two different ways. Koko`s real name is Al Molybden (アル・モリブデン ). His parents, Chrom and Rin Molybden, were researchers at a Biotope Company which was studying cutting-edge technology. After they confronted Professor Zed, they were run off the road and before their vehicle exploded, they managed to push Coco to safety where a Zarude found it and raised him.\nZarude could not allow himself to leave the abandon child there, so he decided to disobey the law of the forest, leave his tribe behind, and live alone with the child, whom he named Coco. It has been 10 years since this Pokémon first started to raise this human when Coco meets Satoshi and Pikachu as they visit Okoya Forest. This is the first \"Human friend\" he has ever made. Little by little, questions start to sprout deep in his mind as he had been fully convinced he was a Pokémon.\nSatoshi pulled Coco out of the water and took him to the local Pokémon Center to get better. After waking up, he escaped and found himself in the city. He begins to trust Satoshi as a friend and then Zarude ends up taking him to the lab where they find a picture of his parents and Coco as a child. He asks Zarude, \"Father, am I a human? Am I a Pokémon?\" As Coco ponders this, they are betrayed by Professor Zed, who tracked Coco as he returned into the jungle, signalizing a drastic change to the peaceful days it has thus far been enjoying. Coco fights to protect the jungle from Professor Zed, finally gaining the trust of all the Zarude who also come to his aid to defend their home.",
