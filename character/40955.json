  "description" : "He is a mysterious nobleman and quite a gentleman. Rather than calling Angelique by her name, he often calls her \"mademoiselle\". He likes playing the piano and drinking tea.\nIn season 2 he is fully possessed by Erebos and seems to want to help Angelique and the others, but cannot always control his condition. Inside him, his real self and Erebos coexist.\nHe has lived for 200 years due to Erebos. When he was younger, the ship his family and him were in got caught in a fierce storm. As Nyx was drowning, he pleaded for his life, saying that he would do anything. Erebos heard him and saved him, possessing him, but Nyx`s parents drowned. This is why Nyx fears and hates the sound of the sea as it was when Erebos first possessed him. He is the core that Erebos uses to send Thanatos into the world.\nThe only hope he had to get rid of Erebos was the Queen`s Egg, so he traveled all over the world and found Angelique. When she becomes the Queen, Nyx wishes for her to give him a peaceful death.\nNyx blames himself for making Angelique suffer, taking away her home and parents but Angelique says it was Erebos who did that and that Nyx was the one who gave her many precious things, including a place to belong to.\nHe fights Thanathos with a whip.\nSource: Wiki",
