  "description" : "Serpico, as a child, was found and picked up by http://anidb.net/ch91869 [Farnese] when he was left beaten and lying on the street, while it snowed. Because of that, to him, Farnese was like a guardian angel who saved him from his miserable life on the streets. However, his life after that wasn`t really easy - he had to bear with her constant \"torture\", duel with other nobles as well as being bitten or having his blood drank by her when he didn`t behave as she wanted. Even after she condemned his demented mother for being heretic and forced him to burn her himself, he couldn`t come to hate her.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
