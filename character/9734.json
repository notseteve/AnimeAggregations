  "description" : "Kozuka Washuu is Sasami`s cooking teacher. She is also the mentor/advisor of the secret magical girl club and teaches its members the fundamentals of being a magical girl. Even though she is recruited by the school, she is in fact from the world of the witches. She is also Ryo-Ohki`s mistress, using the poor cabbit in some of her cooking demonstrations. Although she is the cooking teacher, it was revealed that she (ironically) cannot cook. Despite being from the world of the witches, she is a normal human. People like her are labeled \"Story Tellers\".\nSource: wiki",
