  "description" : "The longtime rival of http://anidb.net/ch13534 [Itagaki Manabu], Imai was the one boxer who managed to thwart Itagaki in his high-school days. They fought a total of three times in the amateur ring; each time Imai was victorious. His build, KO pattern, and even hairstyle are remarkably similar to those of Itagaki`s senpai, Makunouchi Ippo. Imai is ordinarily cool and composed, bearing a poker face even in the heat of battle. It seems the only people who can rouse him out of this perpetual calm are Ippo, Itagaki, and Itagaki`s sister Nanako -- with whom Imai is very much smitten.",
