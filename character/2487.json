As Miki`s mother, she genuinely cares about the girl, but can be quite harsh, and often loses her temper, slapping Miki around. It is once shown during a flashback, she was once actually quite beautiful; the stress of raising such an exasperating daughter like Miki was no doubt the cause of her current obesity. As she has Miki deliver ramen, Makiko`s mantra is \"Deliveries are about speed!\"When she is drunk, she turns to be a drunken kung-fu master.",
