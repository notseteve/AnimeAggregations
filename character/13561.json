She is also freakishly strong despite her willowy appearance. Since Takanashi Souta started working at Wagnaria, she has been hitting him more frequently than others, a risk he takes so he can cure her androphobia.\n[SPOILER]It turns out that Inami`s father is to blame for her behavior, since he brainwashed her into fearing all men and placed extra weights in her schoolbags which gradually increased her strength.[/SPOILER]",
