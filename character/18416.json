  "description" : "Ash is the Queen`s butler who delivers all of the Queen`s request to the Phantomhive Head. His appearance is the exact opposite of Sebastian`s, where Sebastian has a black suit and hair color, Ash has a white suit and hair color. It is hinted that he might be connected to the organization that killed Ciel`s parents as in the new opening he is seen walking away from the burning mansion. He also has the same facial features as Angela. In the manga, he wears large goggles and is known as John. He plays a shorter, more comical role mostly spent trying to keep up with Queen Victoria and calming her hysterical fits of tears.",
