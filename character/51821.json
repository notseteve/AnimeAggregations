  "description" : "Misaki is an upperclassman of Kouhei who lost her eyesight in an accident in elementary school. She meets Kouhei on the roof of school during sunset. She has no caution toward those bearing the handicap of darkness and those who have blind reason, and she has a sociable personality where she can be unreserved with anyone. Her house is right in front of the school, so she can get to school even by herself. She used to play around in the high school even before she lost her eyesight, so she is used to it. She is a surprisingly big eater, and there is a scene where she eats several people`s worth of curry at the cafeteria. She often shows up at the theater club to help her best friend Yukimi Miyama.\nSource: Wikipedia",
