  "description" : "Takeru is a Pok√©mon trainer that was attempting to enter the Kalos League but did not get enough badges in time to enter. He attended the opening ceremonies for the Kalos League where he saw Ash being interviewed and that he was going to be the winner of the league.\nMad and annoyed that he didn`t manage to enter the league, he tried to take that frustration out on Ash by challenging him to battle but Serena pulled him away but not before he accepted the challenge to battle at another time. When Ash was heading for his first round battle, Takeru confronted him again and this time the battle took place. Ash handily defeated him with Pikachu and Takeru broke down crying and told Ash to honor the dreams of those like him that wanted to compete but couldn`t.",
