  "description" : "Formerly Doug`s subordinate/partner in the GPO, Ayaka is now assigned as a captain in Wong`s unit, and is directly in charge of capturing Kurau. She seems to be focused on advancing in rank by any means possible, but in fact her own father was the head of the GPO until he was assassinated. For this reason, Ayaka prefers to be called only by her first name, and one of her real goals is to find out the reasons behind her father`s death. She trusts no one with this secret, although she still keeps track of her former partner Doug, and she and Wong appear to develop a relationship based on mutual respect.",
