  "description" : "The oldest of the sisters. The 25-years-old college graduate wants to achieve her dream of becoming a Voice Actress while doing a part-time job. She loves anime because animation was her refuge during the dark times that came after her mother`s death in her early childhood. She is very mature and a workaholic, to the point of prioritizing her job over acquaintances and the chance of finding a romantic partner.\nSource: http://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Watanuki-san_Chi_No",
