  "description" : "At the beginning of the story, Kuriko`s only interest in Kazuki is to obtain his genes for the wealthy and influential Kazetsubaki family and the stature that goes with being the mother of a powerful sorcerer. A third year student and a member of the student government, Kuriko takes great pleasure in flirting with Kazuki and teasing Yuna. Often she will appear out of nowhere into Kazuki`s arms or lap right in front of Yuna or use her body, charm, or her family`s resources to seduce Kazuki. Of the three girls, Kuriko demonstrates to be the most knowledgeable with regards to magic and the politics surrounding magic. She has an extremely high magic count, and it is considered to be among the strongest, though it is nowhere near as strong as Kazuki`s. Near the beginning of the series, Kuriko finds herself playing \"mother\" to the ghost girl Elizabeth after an incident that resulted in both the boys and girls dorms merging together by one of Kazuki`s magical spells.",
