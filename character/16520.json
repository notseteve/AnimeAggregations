  "description" : "Madame Christmas is the proprietor of a hostess bar in Central City frequently patronaged by http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang]. At first, it would merely seem that this bar is further proof of Mustang`s unapologetic debauchery, but it becomes quite apparent that the women under Madame Christmas` care act as secret informants to Mustang and his squad and that Madame Christmas herself is a skilled intelligencer and contact between Roy and http://anidb.net/ch14966 [Lt. General Grumman] in East City.\nA rather gruff woman, Madame Christmas is frequently sharp with Roy. It has been recently revealed by a secret investigation into Roy`s past carried out by Central Command`s agents that Madame Christmas` real name is Chris Mustang and that she is Roy`s foster mother. Well aware of Roy`s ambitions as well as the clandestine goings-on of his enemies, Madame Christmas expects great things of her little boy.\nIn Character Guidebook 3 released recently in Japan it`s revealed Chris Mustang is actually the younger sister to Roy`s biological father, making her his aunt. According to this guide, she took Roy in after the death of both his parents, when Roy was still very young.",
