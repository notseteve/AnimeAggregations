  "description" : "Breloom is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Shroomish can metamorph into. This diurnal herbivore that lives in fields and forests with leaves for Breloom to feed on. Its favorite climate conditions are sunlight-induced warmth and humidity, which is when Breloom is at its most active. Breloom`s body is configured for battling opponents in a competitive boxing fashion. Its stretchable arms are capable of extremely quick, rapid-fire punches that are virtually invisible, putting professional human boxers to shame (compare with Hitmonchan).\nSpores are located within Breloom`s toadstool cap, and Breloom sprays and scatters these spores out of the red holes on its cap as its tool to debilitate and poison opponents. Also toxically sporous are the seeds on Breloom`s tail, which sometimes drop off and are grown back. These seeds let loose their sporous contents when Breloom thwacks an opponent with its tail, making the foe even more at risk of succumbing to poisoning. These seeds are horrid things to consume; a mere bite out of one of these seeds that may be lying around on the forest floor will cause the consumer`s stomach to rumble.\nBreloom is notable as one of two final-form Pokemon to receive the attack Spore, a sleep-inducing move with an accuracy of 100.",
