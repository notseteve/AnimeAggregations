  "description" : "Ellie lives with her grandpa Tokuzo at the Sangi Ranch. She helps her grandpa raise Merriep. She had been trying to help her Denryu perfect its ThunderPunch when Ash and his friends stopped by the ranch.\nTokuzo wanted to trade in Ellie`s Ampharos at a Pok√©mon Trade Meet in the neighboring town but Ellie knew that her Denryu was doing its best and asked to let her watch it a bit longer to help it improve. Her faith in Denryu proved to be well placed as Ellie`s Ampharos fought off Team Rocket and protected the Merriep from being stolen.\nEllie was very grateful to Iris` Dragonite for it coaching Denryu. She hoped that Ash and his friends would stop by again the next time they were in the area.",
