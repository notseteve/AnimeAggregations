  "description" : "A twenty-six year-old businessman who runs a financial firm in Shinjuku. He was saved by Ayase`s kindness around four years ago, therefore saved Ayase when he was being auctioned off by buying him for 120 million Yen. In order to protect Ayase, he forced the 120 million yen debt (plus a hefty interest of 10% every 10 days) on Ayase as a means to keep Ayase with him, and pays 500,000 Yen to Ayase each time they have sex.\nHe has a hard time trying to express his feelings towards Ayase due to his gruff, no-nonsense exterior, and particularly Ayase`s naïveté and reluctance to accept a relationship between two guys. Domineering, possessive and jealous, Kanou forbids anyone to come close to Ayase without his permission and lets him go outside only begrudgingly. He is not above bullying or even manhandling Ayase if he happens to hurt his feelings. Nevertherless, Kanou is mostly kind and considerate towards Ayase and expresses his passionate affection without restraint.\nRealizing that he has started off on the wrong foot by raping Ayase after the auction, he tries to make it up to him by doing various things with mixed results (i.e: solving Testuo`s debt, and in the manga: buying Ayase new clothes, allowing him to attend summer classes, allowing Ayase to work).\nIn the released artbook, an interview with him shows that his motto is \"perseverance brings success\" and that he washes his right shoulder first when bathing.\nSource: wiki",
