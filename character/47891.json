  "description" : "Nola is a Spirit Hunter who is introduced during their biannual assembly; she is ten years older than Elsie and Haqua. She is arrogant and disdainful; she looks down on younger demons. Although she has a human partner, Asama Ryou, she sometimes tries to force Loose Spirits out without his help. Her preferred method of capturing Loose Spirits is to fulfill the target`s desire: (e.g. riches for those who want money, suitable partners for those who desire love, death to her enemies for those who desire revenge). Due to her impulsive nature, she sometimes assumes the target`s strong emotion to be hate instead of love, and attacks the target`s person of affection.\nSource: Wiki",
