She`s the daughter of a prestigious family in Frey City and has completed lessons in a wide variety of fields with excellent grades. She hired a talent agent to attempt to convince Yashio to become her producer but she only evaluates people that she could see perform herself and she ended up telling Amelia that due to her loss to Serena, she could tell she didn`t completely have her whole heart into performing in Tripokalon.\nSerena first met Amelia in the waiting room when she was told that the show was about to start. Amelia performed in the last group in the theme performances and ended up being the last person to proceed to the free performance after using Attract on the Sihorn to drawn them to her.\nIn the free performance, Clemont noted that Amelia was the favorite to win the tournament and Clemont`s Chespin got affected by Attract. Despite her excellent performance, she lost the tournament to Serena.",
