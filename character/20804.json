  "description" : "First appearing as a fellow classmate of Wataru going to Promised Island, it turns that she is sent by someone to keep an eye on Wataru, and apparently to break him apart from his sisters. Part of this includes getting stuck as pretending to be Wataru`s 13th sister, although she really isn`t.\nAs she spends more time with Wataru and his sisters, she realises how much he means to the girls and how much he cares about each and every one of them, including her.\nWhen it comes to indecisiveness and problems that Wataru seems to run into, she helps to set him straight and offer her honest opinions and advice.",
