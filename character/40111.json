  "description" : "Ranko is the first cousin of Chihiro. Often called Wanko by Chihiro, at times she also keeps on saying that Chihiro should use \"-san\" after her name. She likes teasing Chihiro and Rea as well. She likes Chihiro and develops a rivalry with Rea. She eventually confesses to Chihiro, but realizes before answering that he loves Rea; however, she is fine with her unrequited love. Although she hasn`t given up and occasionally does something reckless. Such as swiping and gulping down a bottle of Resurrection Pills to turn herself into a zombie. However, this fails as the pills were a different medication (Darin was too lazy to change the bottle label and determins which pills were which by size and shape,) although she did pass out from a minor allergic reaction. Her interest in Chihiro stems from him saving her from a dog when she was about 6 years old. Thing is, at the time he was worried the movie she was shielding herself with would get damaged which is what prompted him into action.\nSource: Wikipedia",
