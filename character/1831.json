  "description" : "Attenborough Cortitch is a hyperactive, impulsive, trigger-happy man, who is the gunner of Dai-Gurren`s control team. He tends to fire at enemies or move Dai-Gurren without warning. After the timeskip, he joins Leeron`s science team and still appears to have his hyperactive nature. After Team Dai-Gurren moved to Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren, he assumed the same position he had before at the weapons control. Curiously, this trait became one of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann`s attacks. He randomly showed up in the series one day, later it was confirmed that he sneaked into some bozo`s luggage, and that is how he joined Team Dai Gurren.",
