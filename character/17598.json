  "description" : "Ishimatsu is yojimbo to an influential yakuza boss, http://anidb.net/ch17597 [Rikiei]. His considerable height, dark skin and a string of large Buddhist beads he wears around his neck are distinctive features. Rikiei offers http://anidb.net/ch4865 [Mugen] a partnership after Mugen impresses him with his fighting skills. This does not sit well with Ishimatsu, and he and Mugen do not get along; barely past introductions they are attacking each other. Their duel is cut short by Rikiei, who wants to get down to business. Eventually, disillusioned by http://anidb.net/ch17599 [Kawara Heitarou]`s sacrifice, Ishimatsu cuts down Rikiei, and finishes his duel with Mugen. He suffers an honorable defeat. His manriki can be seen as a wild card, in the same light as Mugen`s tantou.\nSource: Wikipedia",
