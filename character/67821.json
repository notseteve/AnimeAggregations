  "description" : "Takane was the human form of \"Ene\". As a human, Takane was ranked second in the country on a game called `Dead Bullet -1989-` under the name of \"Senkou no Maihime\" (Dancing Princess of the Spotlight) and often stayed up late at night playing. This caused her often to have a bad-tempered personality.\nShe used to suffer from an illness which caused her to lose consciousness at random times. Because of this, she was placed in a separate class at school with http://anidb.net/ch67822 [Kokonose Haruka].\nThey put up a gaming booth in their class, which led to her meeting Ayano -the daughter of their homeroom teacher- along with Shintarou, which they later started to be friends.\nShe died due to unknown reasons after loosing consciousness on the school hallway and woke up to find herself in the body of a cybergirl, living in the cyber world.\nShe then transferred herself to Shintarou`s PC to be a cheer up for him in the sad times after loosing their mutual friend, Ayano. She doesn`t reveal her true identities to Shintarou.\nIts hinted that Tateyama was involved in her death, as well as Haruka`s.\nTakane harbors strong feelings towards Haruka. She regrets the fact that she was never been able to confess it to him.\nHer songs are: \"Headphone Actor\" which tells a fictional story about her trying to escape the city which is falling, to reach a certain person, and \"Yukei Yesterday\" (Yesterday Evening) which is a story about she and Haruka and her feelings toward him",
