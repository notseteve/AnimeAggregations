  "description" : "This unmanned aircraft serves as a support platform for mobile suits that can`t fly in Earth`s atmosphere. Its high thrust allows the Guul to make vertical take-offs and landings, and perform aerial manoeuvres even while carrying a mobile suit on its back. The Guul is armed with missile launchers which can be remotely controlled by the mobile suit`s pilot, and its wing sections fold up for storage aboard ZAFT`s Vosgulov-class submarine carriers.",
