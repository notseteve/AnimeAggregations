  "description" : "Pakuyasa was the person Batou had mistaken http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki] for during Joui Wars. Batou saw him going through scores of Amanto in order to reach him, and when he did, he introduced himself as Pakuyasa.\nApparently, he fought to survive so he could bring food back to his master, Gintoki. Said samurai confirmed this, revealing that Pakuyasa was a rookie whom he believed wasn`t cut out for the battlefield so he had the rookie doing food supply runs. Since he really wasn`t cut out for that, he left to run two failed businesses before settling on doing shady odd jobs.\nDuring Batou`s and Gintoki`s fight, Batou fought several clones of Gintoki, who were landing hits on him in order to distract him. One of the clones was created in the image of Pakuyasa.\nSource: Gintama Wiki, edited.",
