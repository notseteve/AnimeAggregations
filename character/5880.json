  "description" : "Juusan-hime is the half-sister of the five Ran brothers. She was raised by her mother`s family, the Shiba clan, who trained her as both a fighter and as a princess. The literal meaning of her name is \"Thirteenth Princess\", although she also had the childhood nickname \"Hotaru\" (firefly).\nSetsuna Ran sends Juusan-hime to the imperial capital as a potential bride for either Ryuki or Seiran. Because she looks very similar to Shurei, the two women exchange places to avert an assassination plot from a rogue member of the Shiba clan. After Shusui resigns from the palace, Juusan-hime succeeds her as chief lady-in-waiting and is likely to become Ryuki`s consort if Shurei continues to reject his proposal of marriage.",
