  "description" : "Leigharch is an Irish driver who worked with Shenhua at one time. A compulsive smoker of marijuana (in the manga he actually snorts cocaine), he has a distressingly frequent tendency to hallucinate at inopportune times, such as in the middle of a car chase. Most of his hallucinations are actually references to Western pop culture, such as Playmates, Star Trek characters like Jean-Luc Picard and Klingons, or sixties rock music such as Jimi Hendrix. Leigharch is said by Shenhua to have suffered a massive overdose (he \"couldn`t get back from Mars\"), inducing psychological damage severe enough to commit him to full-time medical attention.",
