  "description" : "During the 7th Space War, the United Nations Earth developed and deployed three advanced new mobile suit designs to counter the Space Revolutionary Army. One of these new units was the GT-9600 Gundam Leopard, and like its brethren GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster and GX-9900 Gundam X, it was equipped with a \"flash system\", enabling a Newtype pilot to mentally remote-control a large number of bit mobile suits (or \"mobile bits\") - in the Leopard`s case, the FT-9600 GT-Bit. Although incapable of atmospheric flight, the Leopard was equipped with a set of gliding wheels in its feet, allowing it to \"drive\" on the ground at high speeds. The Leopard was also massive armored and armed, with its primary weapon being a large-caliber \"inner arm Gatling\" which was fitted over the left arm when in use. A multitude of additional armaments, including various missiles, grenade launchers, and shell-firing weapons, made the Gundam Leopard a literal walking fortress.\nAlthough an unknown number of Leopards were manufactured, only one unit is known to have survived the war. This last remaining Leopard would find its way into the hands of Vulture mercenary pilot Roybea Loy, who operated this heavily-armed Gundam during the military chaos occuring in A.W. 0015. Later that same year, Kid Salsamille, the ingenious young mobile suit mechanic aboard the Vulture land battleship Freeden, developed an optional \"S-1\" booster, allowing the Leopard to operate underwater like an amphibious mobile suit. The unit would later be upgraded to the GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy after being heavily damaged in a battle with Milra Draido`s NRX-010 Gable.",
