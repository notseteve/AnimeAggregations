  "description" : "Lord Shabboneau resides at Shabboneau Castle in the Kalos region. He is indebted to Princess Ally`s father.\nEvery year, once a Kabigon from the mountains has eaten all the roots, a festival with prayers for a good harvest takes place out of gratitude. At the climax of the festival, when the sound of the Pokémon Flute the lord of Shabboneau Castle plays reverberates on the plaza, Kabigon returns to the mountains while eating our offerings and dancing.\nLord Shabboneau lost possession of the Pokémon Flute the year that Ash and his friends were in the village. He kept lying to people by saying he had a recorder allergy that gives him hives when he plays the flute and that he developed a recorder phobia. It was infact Princess Ally from the Parfum Palace of the neighboring village who came for a visit and thought the flute was so cute and took it with her. Lord Shabboneau didn`t protest as he owed a lot to her father and didn`t want to offend her.\nWith the help of Ash and his friends, they were able to retrieve the flute from Princess Ally so that Lord Shabboneau was able to play it as part of the festival that year.",
