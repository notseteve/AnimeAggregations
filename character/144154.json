  "description" : "Phinxs uses his hands in battle, which has been shown to be extremely powerful. He is one of the original Phantom Troupe members from Meteor City and wears an Egyptian Pharaoh-like outfit in battle. Phinxs seems to get along best with Feitan, and is almost always seen partnered with him both in and out of combat. His Nen ability is called \"Ripper Cyclotron\", the strength of which is dependent upon how many times he rotates his arm; the more rotations, the more powerful his attack will be. In terms of physical strength, Phinxs is ranked second among the Troupe members. His name is an anagram for \"Sphinx\".\nNen type: Enhancement\nSource: Wiki",
