  "description" : "The Tapasa are the four Bakiraka that serve as the personal bodyguards of http://anidb.net/ch49432 [Silat]. Each of these four men have knots on their knuckles and mysterious markings on their foreheads. Their bodies are muscular and their skin colour is brown, like all Kushan. The clothes they wear are small and light, minimal so as to not interfere during battles.\nThe Tapasa have a strong monk-like mentality and as such don`t show much characteristics besides undying loyalty to Silat. However unlike other Bakiraka assassins, they don`t exhibit a cruel nature and even try to appear friendly while disguising in Falconia, but the sight of their huge grinning smiles terrified http://anidb.net/ch91824 [Luca].\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
