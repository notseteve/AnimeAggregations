  "description" : "Cima is the commander of a group of former Zeon marines, an elite force which was renowned for war crimes and ruthless tactics during the One Year War. Long shunned by her former comrades, Cima grudgingly agrees to join forces with Delaz and aid him with Operation Stardust. Her fleet consists of the Zanzibar-class cruiser Lili Marleen, a half-dozen Musai cruisers, and some 30 Gelgoog mobile suits - including a souped-up commander`s model, which Cima personally takes into battle whenever the craving for combat strikes her.",
