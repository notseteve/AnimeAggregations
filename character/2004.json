  "description" : "Pippin is a massive dark-skinned man who wields an equally massive mace. A former miner who lent his strength to the old Band of the Hawk, his fast reactions and raw strength save the skin of the Hawks on many occasions. Despite his massive physical stature, Pippin proves to be a kind and patient individual, as shown when he dragged Guts to the festivities, keeping his cool even when Guts hit him and made him bleed. A man of few words, which, along with his appearance, might have others wrongly doubt his intelligence. He was often associated with Rickert, who he seemed to share a big-brother relationship with.\nDuring the Eclipse, he held off an Apostle while Casca and Judeau tried to escape. Pippin was seen by Guts one last time before the Count ripped him to shreds.",
