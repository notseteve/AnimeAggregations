He expresses his will through a divine vessel called the Cocytus, which (in Shana`s case) takes the form of a pendant which the picture shows. Alastor is considered to be one of the strongest of all Lords or Denizens; in fact being one of the true Gods of the Crimson Realm. But even so, he tries to keep the Denizens from consuming Power of Existence.",
