  "description" : "Burgundy`s Stoutland was revealed during her battle with Ash in the Don Battle Tournament in Raimon Town. Burgundy thought she had the upper hand in the battle since it was the first time that Ash and his Palpitoad had ever battled together. Ash`s Palpitoad proved to be able to use its moves in a good combination which caught Burgundy`s Stoutland off-guard. It was unable to defeat Ash`s Palpitoad in the battle and the loss eliminated Burgundy from the tournament.",
