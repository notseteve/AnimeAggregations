  "description" : "The group`s extremely short friend. Renge has a penchant for eating obsessively, yet she is always thin (Although, sometimes, when she eats a lot, she is shown to have a belly). Renge is the stereotypical, overexcited kid, with a tendency to whine, but she mostly serves as a cheering squad. She later acquires a kitten that she carries with her most of the time. Much to her friends surprise, she has two younger sisters named Men-Men and Mikan, who both look identical to Renge. She is good friends with Tsukio, and usually gives him money for breakfast. Her features resemble that of `Astro Girl`.",
