After Isaac and Miria steal his family`s fortune, Dallas goes on a string of robberies with his friends, and getting mixed up with Szilard`s plans. He and his group are later captured by Szilard, and made into quasi-immortals (they can`t be killed, but they do age). Dallas goes looking for revenge with his newfound powers, but eventually gets captured by the Gandors, cemented in a steel barrel, and dropped to the bottom of the Hudson river. Eve later agrees to allow him to be dredged up and experimented on, believing it preferable to his spending the rest of his life drowning and reviving.",
