  "description" : "Snubbull is a pink, blue spotted, bipedal canine that resembles a bulldog. Despite its rather intimidating appearance, Snubbull has a playful and affectionate personality, similar to the real-life bulldog, which makes it a popular pet among the women of the Pokémon world. Another of Snubbull`s personality traits is its cowardice, which it tries to hide behind a gruff exterior. If it feels threatened, Snubbull can bare its fangs and make its appearance intentionally intimidating to terrorize smaller and/or weaker Pokémon into running away. However, Snubbull has also been observed to be a little sad at driving away potential friends like this.",
