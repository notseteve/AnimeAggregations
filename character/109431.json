  "description" : "Sakaigawa Miyuki is a third-year taking up Dentistry and the drummer of the band GYROAXIA.\nBeing amongst the oldest in GYROAXIA, he`s friendly towards children and women, and is actually quite stoic despite his superficial looks. He`s significantly more hostile towards Kenta Satozuka, strongly disagreeing with his management policies. He also admires Nayuta Asahi, but doesn`t agree with Kenta`s idea of throwing his humanity away for him.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream! Wiki",
