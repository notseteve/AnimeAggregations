  "description" : "Clumsy and anemic, Minawa ends up living with Mahoro and Suguru and going to school under the pretext of being Mahoro`s younger sister. She claims to be a runaway member of The Management, but is later revealed to have been sent to gather information on VESPER`s battle android Mahoro after being promised a heart in return. Mahoro, however, convinces her that the fact that she can cry means she already has a heart.\nShe had no name until one was created by Suguru, so she could pretend to be Mahoro`s little sister.",
