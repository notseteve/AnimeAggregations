  "description" : "Multi`s younger sister: an advanced successor of Multi, but without emotions. Serio was sent with Ayaka to Sanyo Girls` School for field testing and speaks using formal Japanese. She is technically superior to Multi and is equipped with a satellite system capable of communicating with and storing data on the Kurusagawa mainframe host computer. Serio is more effective than Multi as a maid robot but because she lacks emotions, does not feel as human. She does have a heart, and tries to help people even though she may fail as she is unable to understand the complex emotional aspects behind them.",
