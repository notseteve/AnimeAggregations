She later develops feelings for Sae while maintaining the antagonistic attitude (the typical tsundere archetype). In a bonus chapter in volume four of the manga, Natsume goes through various misfortunes on her first day arriving to school. Unable to find her shoebox and ready to break down, Sae shows up to help her, in which she develops strong feelings for her. At the end, as weeks pass, Natsume manages to bump into Sae only to find her already close to http://anidb.net/ch7058 [Hiro], in which she reacts crudely to Sae.",
