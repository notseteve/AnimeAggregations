  "description" : "Lithia is the granddaughter of the Pope of Geminar and president of the Academy`s student council. She is a bitter and sarcastic woman who often thinks of Kenshi as a \"wild animal\", and after the massage that was given to her (courtesy of Mexiah), she referred to him as that ever since. She suffers from extreme stress from the intense amount of work she has, and tends to pass out when she`s overworked. However, she begins to feel more relaxed after Kenshi spiked her tea with a sleep-inducing powder, though her sarcastic nature still remains. She also seems to dislike Morga, the former student council president because she does not work well with others and she is also a lunatic. Only in the last few episodes, although she still refers to Kenshi as a \"wild animal\", it is shown that she gets flustered around hinting she may also have feelings for him.\nSource: Wiki",
