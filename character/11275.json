  "description" : "Amon is a 25-year-old S-class Hunter and Robin`s partner. Although he is not a witch, he carries the witch gene. Once Robin accepts her fate as the \"Eve of Witches\", Amon volunteers to be a watchman who will terminate her if she becomes destructive. His ultimate fate is unknown. The reactions of the other characters show that he is believed to be alive. It is implied that Amon is not only Robin`s protector and possible destructor, but also Robin`s romantic interest.\nSource: Wikipedia",
