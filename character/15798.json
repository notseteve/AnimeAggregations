  "description" : "Aisia came to Hatsunejima to study magic with Grandma, and thought Jun`ichi was a master wizard at first. Although she has knowledge of how to use magic, her control of her capabilities and her judgment are, at best, erratic. She firmly believes that magic can and should be used for the good of all, something her own grandmother always practiced.",
