  "description" : "A prodigy novelist in her high school years, usually referred to as sensei and originally featured in the Read or Die manga as a teenage friend of the older Yomiko. She is often frustrated with Yomiko`s obsession with books - and later the Paper Sisters when they move into her home - and chides her for being absentminded, leaving post-its in her room. Since Yomiko`s disappearance, she has become very self-sufficient but unfortunately wistful, cranky and bitter at times in her loneliness. She remained in Japan, despite her parents` move to the United States, in order to housekeep and tend to Yomiko`s personal effects until her (presumed) return.",
