Once Golbat had found some space it used a Wing Attack which slammed Kingler onto one of the platforms above water-level. Mandi order Golbat to use Mega-Drain but as Golbat got closer, Ash ordered Kingler to use Hyper-Beam, hitting Golbat head-on and eliminating Mandi from the competition in the first round.",
