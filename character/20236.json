  "description" : "The eldest son of Cecilie. From the beginning, Gwendal has objections to Yuuri becoming the Maou. He is a skilled tactician and is capable of using earth magic and can cast barriers. When not otherwise busy, Gwendal indulges in his hobby of knitting and sewing but often his creatures look nothing like what they`re supposed to (for example a bear got mistaken for a black pig or a cat that looks like a raccoon). He is adamnant that knitting helps him sharpen his concentration but actually its a stress reliever for him since childhood. He is also quite fond of cute animals or cute objects such as the dolphin keychain (Bandou-kun) Yuuri received at the dolphin show and later gave to him. His childhood best friend is Anissina von Karbelnikoff, an inventor who often tests out her inventions on him, much to his displeasure. Anissina is also the one who taught Gwendal how to knit.\nGwendal is a tough guy except when it comes to his childhood friend, Anissina, and his brothers. He is afraid of Anissina and often hides from her so he can prevent being used in one of her crazy experiments. He is even seen sweating in panic at the thought of her. While he does not outwardly show much affection towards his brothers, he shows in times of great stress that he does care, an example being his decision to stand against the Original King to save his little brother, Wolfram. Jozak, who was sent to locate one of the Four Forbidden Boxes, tells Conrad that Gwendal really cares for Conrad`s wellbeing and doesn`t want Conrad to worry despite the Original King`s wishes for Conrad to find the Boxes. His ancestor, Siegbert Voltaire, fought along the Original King.",
