  "description" : "Dark Schneider is the main protagonist of the series (as the story is told mainly from his perspective), and is the most powerful wizard in the series. 15 years prior to the story`s beginning, he had army of thousands of wizards and warriors, led by his adjudants \"The Riders of Havoc\" (consisting of Arshes Nei, Abigail, Gara, and Kall-Su.) He was defeated by Lars Ul Meta-Licana, the prince of the kingdom Meta-Licana. He escaped death however by using his dark arts to reincarnate himself into the form of a young child. Geo Soto Noto, the head priest of Meta-Licana then sealed Dark Schneider`s spirit so it would not resurface in the young boy. After all-out war erupted to break the seals of Anthrax, the high-priest ordered that Dark Schneider be unleashed into the world once again to conquer it. Dark Schneider`s main goal is to take over the world and \"have all the women in the world\". The early part of the story is mainly based on him getting his crew back, known as the \"Riders of Havoc\" or the \"Four Heavenly Kings\", as well as achieving the power he once had so he can begin his goal of world conquest yet again. As many characters in Bastards, his name is derived from a Heavy metal reference (Udo Dirkschneider, ex-singer of Accept).",
