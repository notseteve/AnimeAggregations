Blackbeard was formerly a member of the Whitebeard Pirates second division led by Portgas D. Ace until he killed fourth division commander Thatch for the Yami Yami no Mi.\n* Abilities:\nBlackbeard possesses incredible natural strength, evident of his massive build, he has eaten the Yami Yami no Mi, with it, he can manipulate gravity.\nDue to the Yami Yami no Mi`s gravitational ability, Blackbeard, unlike every other Logia user, cannot let attacks simply pass through him, meaning he takes damage like any human would but is also able to withstand more pain. He compensates for this one major flaw with his massive strength.\nThe second, and most frightening power of the fruit is to nullify other Devil Fruit abilities through physical contact.",
