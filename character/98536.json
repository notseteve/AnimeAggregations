He is cold and ruthless at first due to a very rough childhood until meeting http://anidb.net/ch2083 [Oozora Tsubasa], which allows him to regain his love for football. His appearance in http://anidb.net/a3561 [Captain Tsubasa: Sekai Daikessen!! Jr. World Cup] is very different from the manga and other anime adaptations since he didn`t appear in the canon story until years later.",
