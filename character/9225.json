  "description" : "The current holder of the top kill score among Topless pilots, Lal`C, along with fellow pilots Nicola and Tycho, is part of the so-called \"Idol\" group (pilots with exceptionally high kill rates). She is also the current pilot of Buster Machine Dix-Neuf, the oldest buster machine still in operation. Nicknamed \"princess\" (\"hime\") by her teammates, Lal`C is outwardly cool and self-confident - traits that draw Nono`s admiration for her, much to her initial annoyance. It is Lal`C who helps induct Nono (with some indirect assistance from Nicola) into the Fraternity as an \"auxiliary member\", despite the fact that Nono manifests none of the traits associated with being a Topless.\nWhile initially bothered by Nono`s hero-worship of her, Lal`C gradually gets used to her company, to the point where she can talk about things she wouldn`t normally tell anyone. She senses some potential in Nono, and admires the girl`s never-give-up attitude a little (though she might act otherwise), but doubts if guts and perseverance alone can make the girl`s dreams come true.",
