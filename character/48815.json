  "description" : "The Glaug is a larger and more heavily armed tactical pod used by unit commanders in the mecha forces of the Zentradi Army. Increasing the firepower beyond the standard Reguld Battle Pod, the Glaug is built with two arm units each holding one large-bore and one small-bore impact cannons and the Glaug also is equipped with a rare long range top-mounted, electron beam cannon. Along with the standard two anti-personnel cannons on the front ventral side of the fuselage, the Glaug can operate in nearly any capacity. To handle the increased power demands, the Glaug has a much more powerful single fusion reactor. Like the Reguld, the Glaug is ground based within a planetary atmosphere but uses numerous vernier thrusters and powerful dual engines for space flight.\nThe Glaug was customarily used much more frequently in the Zentradi mecha forces but has become somewhat of a rarity in the modern age of Space War One. Roughly 280,000 cycles before the present era, the Supervision Army succeeded in an all-front attack upon the Roiquonmi fully automated weapons factory, thus seriously reducing the Zentradi`s supply of Glaug mecha. The rarity of the Glaug persisted until roughly 3,700 cycles before the present era when a supply of nearly new Glaug units was recovered from an opened weapons storage facility. http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera] repeatedly made use of a Glaug during his campaigns in Space War One and possessed a supply of the mecha to replace damaged units.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/glaug.htm",
