  "description" : "Kazehaya is Sawako`s outgoing and friendly classmate. He is so popular that during middle school, so many girls liked him that they formed a \"Kazehaya is Everyone`s\" Alliance in order to maintain some level of peace among his admirers and more than half of these girls now attend the same high school. Kazehaya has held a long standing interest in Sawako and admits (though not to Sawako) that he likes her, unaware that she feels the same for him.",
