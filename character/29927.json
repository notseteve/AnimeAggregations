  "description" : "Iwasa is http://anidb.net/ch29928 [Toyama]`s friend and fellow Kendo Club member, who also ditches practice. Nothing much is known about this character, and he has not been seen with a shinai before in the anime. In the anime it appears that both he and Toyama have dropped kendo, as they no longer come by. Both he and Toyama are delinquents (they fought two other students when provoked in a video game arcade and destroyed two machines) and have resigned kendo despite their fondness of it. In the closing credits of the final episode of the anime, he is shown to be on the soccer team with Toyama.\nWikipedia",
