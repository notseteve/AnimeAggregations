  "description" : "Akimichi Chouji is a rather large ninja who makes up one third of Team Asuma alongside http://anidb.net/ch8615 [Shikamaru] and http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Ino]. He has a very large appetite and regularly clears out http://anidb.net/ch7742 [Asuma]`s wallet when they go for Korean barbeque. Though he can always be seen eating something, he uses his size to his advantage in battle and gets exceptionally angry when anyone calls him fat. Chouji is able to utilise the ninja techniques of his family that allow him to increase the size of any part of his body.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
