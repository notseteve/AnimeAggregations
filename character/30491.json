Burgh`s Dwebble is very fast and combined with Dig, it proved to be a powerful opponent for Ash`s Tepig. Ash`s Tepig wasn`t able to break through Burgh`s Dwebble`s Protect with its Flame Charge and got knocked back. Burgh`s Dwebble quickly knocked out Ash`s Tepig with Rock Wrecker right after that.\nAsh`s Sewaddle was sent out to battle Burgh`s Dwebble after Ash`s Tepig was knocked out which was a surprise to both Iris and Cilan. Once again, Burgh`s Dwebble`s Protect proved to be a powerful defense as Ash`s Sewaddle had a hard time trying to penetrate its Razor Leaf proved to be ineffective. It wasn`t until Ash`s strategy to use a quick Tackle that Ash`s Sewaddle managed to knock off Burgh`s Dwebble`s rock and its Razor Leaf was able to do some damage. Ash`s Sewaddle ended up winning the match due to Ash`s Sewaddle`s ability to capitalize on that chance.",
