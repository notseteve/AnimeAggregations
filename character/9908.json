  "description" : "Rem Saverem is a crew member of a \"SEEDS\" ship from Earth meant to populate another planet. On Earth, Rem had a lover named Alex, and she leaves on the mission after his death in order to start over. In the manga, during the mission a sentient Plant was born, named Tessla. The crew of the ship proceeded to perform tests, examinations and dissection of her until it ultimately died, actions opposed by Rem and her fellow crew mate William Conrad. Later, both Vash and Knives are born, and fearing for their safety she keeps it a secret from the other members while they are in stasis. In the anime the only sentient plants born are Vash and Knives, who she protects from being killed by the other members of the crew. She proceeds to mentor and teach them. Her teachings of love and peace, especially that no one has the right to take a life, have a profound influence on Vash. The reason why Vash wears a red coat is that Rem told Vash about her favorite flower, the Red Geranium which means determination. When Knives sabotages the fleet, putting it on a crash course with the planet Trigun takes place on, she puts him and Vash in an escape pod, but chooses to stay behind and attempt to prevent the crash rather than escaping her ship. She manages to undo Knives` tampering, allowing a number of the ships to land safely, but perishes as her ship explodes in the atmosphere; her last words to Vash were \"take care of Knives\".",
