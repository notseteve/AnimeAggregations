  "description" : "Shin is the kaioushin of Universe 7; because of that, his life is linked to that of http://anidb.net/ch53774 [Beerus].\nIn Dragon Ball Z, he was one of five kaioushin of the universe, known as Higashi no Kaioushin and subordinate to http://anidb.net/ch107117 [Dai Kaioushin]. However, when http://anidb.net/ch104276 [Maijin Buu] appeared, three of his peers were killed and Buu absorbed Dai Kaioushin, making the surviving Shin the de facto Dai Kaioushin.\nIn Dragon Ball Super, the concept of five kaioushin is ignored and the terms Dai Kaioushin and Higashi no Kaioushin are never used. Instead, the show introduces figures similar to Shin from each universe and refers to them each of them simply as kaioushin.",
