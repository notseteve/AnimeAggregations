  "description" : "Shura belongs to the fabled rank of Gold Saint hierarchy among the other 12 Gold Saints. His guardian star is of the zodiac sign of Capricorn. Shura is the Gold Saint that underwent some modifications in his ideology when the manga was adapted to animation. While the anime series shows Shura as being the most loyal Saint to Athena, Kurumada depicted in his manga a Capricorn Saint that at first was somewhat reluctant, but short moments before his death, rediscovered his loyalty to Athena, and remained faithful to her even after his death. According to the manga, Shura, just like Cancer Deathmask and Pisces Aphrodite, knew that Gemini Saga was behind the Pope`s mask but he still was obeying his orders. As he says in his fight against Shiryu, he doesn`t believe anyone fights for a god anymore, so he doesn`t care about fighting for Athena. He considered that those with power, were automatically qualified to be judged just. He thought that the Pope, even being evil, using that power, could use it for some good.\nThe new Saint Seiya Episode G manga, authored by Megumu Okada under commission by Masami Kurumada, although still non-canonical, shows a version of Shura that conciliate both previous versions: here, Shura is a very loyal Gold Saint, but when he discovers the truth about Gemini Saga, he is attacked by the Demon Emperor Fist, a technique that controls the mind of its victim. According to Saga`s will, Shura starts to follow his orders, but remains loyal to Athena at heart. Masami Kurumada named Shura after Asura, the Hindu demon who eternally hungers for battle and war.",
