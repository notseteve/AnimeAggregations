  "description" : "Sheryl is a Psychic-type Pok√©mon Trainer who is also Olympia`s apprentice. She scolded Carrie for acting out on her own arbitrary interpretations of the future Olympia saw in regards to Ash and Professor Sycamore. She humbly begged for their pardon for their rude actions.\nSheryl explained that Olympia learns about the future by being guided by the voice of the stars. The incident off the coast of Houen was also allowed he to predict the incident with Groudon and Kyogre beforehand. Even though the world suffered from abnormal weather, her prediction enabled people in the Kalos region to take all possible countermeasures, so nothing serious happened.",
