  "description" : "A dispassionate, withdrawn assassin, Golden Darkness is hired by one of Lala`s arranged suitors, Lacospo to kill Rito, until she breaks the contract, noting the true nature behind her target. Golden Darkness is currently staying on Earth, roaming around the city streets and Sainan High, with a motivation to continue her duty to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this (hinting she only said this as an excuse to stay on Earth). Commonly referred as \"Yami-chan\", she spends her time reading books and magazines, while eating taiyaki (it is the only thing she eats on Earth since it is the first food offered by Rito, prior to spending a night at the Yuuki residence for a sukiyaki dinner). By her planet`s calculations, she is 24 years-old, despite having an appearance of an 11 year-old and has a weakness towards anything slimy.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch2387 [Eve] from http://anidb.net/a3321 [Black Cat], another of http://anidb.net/cr2985 [Yabuki Kentaro]`s works, and her are alternative reality versions of each other.",
