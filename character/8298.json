  "description" : "The primary antagonist in Yami no Matsuei. His angelic appearance and characteristics serve to contrast with his brutal nature.\nMuraki`s psychological troubles appear to have begun in childhood with his mother and his half-brother Saki. Muraki`s mother collected dolls, and she is shown as treating him as though he were a doll as well. Muraki`s love of dolls and his collecting of dolls is a motif throughout the manga and anime, paralleling what he does with real people. In the anime, it is suggested that Saki killed Muraki`s parents when they were still children (in the Kyoto arc, Muraki has a flashback of his mother`s funeral and sees Saki smirking during the procession) and later tried to kill him in a craze. However, in the manga, it is not clear what Saki`s role was other than disrupting Muraki`s childhood, and Muraki describes himself as his mother`s murderer. Whatever the circumstances, Saki was shot by one of the family`s guards, and Muraki became obsessed with bringing back Saki in order to kill him himself. Thus, Muraki learned of Tsuzuki while researching his grandfather`s notes, becoming obsessed with Tsuzuki`s body; both carnally and scientifically. In the manga it is clear what Muraki desires, but the anime had to censor such extremes, and so Muraki`s advances toward Tsuzuki were shown as hints of sexual harassment.\nThroughout the story, Muraki manipulates souls of the dead, often killing the people himself, in hopes of drawing the attention of the Shinigami, in particular, Tsuzuki.",
