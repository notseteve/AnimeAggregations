  "description" : "Ledyba has a red thorax (ladybug) with black spots, a cream-coloured underbelly, six legs and two black antennae. By itself a Ledyba is very timid, to the point of being afraid to move. When Ledyba become part of a swarm, they become much more active and can cluster next to each other for warmth in cold weather. A Ledyba communicates with others through an aromatic fluid excreted from the points where its legs meet its thorax. By subtly changing the fluid`s scent, the Ledyba can convey a number of different feelings. The fluid can also help to determine a Ledyba`s location as well as its current feelings.\nLedyba is based on a ladybug.",
