  "description" : "The Wu of Kaiyanwang. He assumed command of Kaiyanwang`s demons after his master was sealed away by Parvati. He`s spent the last 300 years searching for ways to revive Kaiyanwang from his sealed prison. Before becoming a Wu, Benares was a powerful dragon monster who consumed various holy demons. This allowed him to absorb enough intelligence to eventually transform himself into the humanoid being we see today. Benares is a highly powerful figure within the demon world physically, magically, and politically, and strikes fear into even the bravest of souls.",
