  "description" : "Vice Boss of the Gourmet Yakuza, he is completely covered in scars received at the hands of Zebra of the Four Heavenly Kings. He wields a single sword and is adept in the art of Iai, unsheathing, striking and sheathing the sword in a single movement. His ability allows his strength to be proportionate to his exhaustion, so the more tired he is, the more powerful he becomes. The sword he uses is made from a fang of the king of aquatic dragons, the Leodragon. This beast hunts and is capable of crushing the shell of a Crush Turtle with its jaws. Match takes advantage of this fact to cut through Barrygamon`s armor made of the same shell.",
