  "description" : "Suou Yuzuru is the patriarch of the Suou family and chairman of Ouran Academy. He is the 48 year old father of Tamaki and his hobbies are golf, theater and teasing his son. Yuzuru shares some of his son`s characteristics. Despite knowing of his mother`s loathing of Tamaki, he can do little to help the situation. To date, his only act of rebellion against his mother`s wishes seems to be not breaking off his relationship with Tamaki`s mother, instead divorcing the woman his mother had chosen for him. In the anime, he appears to be cold to Tamaki, though this might be to show that he does not favor his son as a student, as a scene in the anime shows photographs of Tamaki at different stages of life on his office desk. It also seems Tamaki gained his charms from his father. Tamaki is very serious in Yuzuru`s presence, but the manga is a little different, showing Yuzuru as eager to tease his son at every opportunity, sending him red herrings in the middle of an investigation and telling tall tales.",
