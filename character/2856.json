  "description" : "Wufei is the descendant of a legendary Chinese warrior clan, who sent him to Earth to fight against Oz. This proud fighter lives by a strict code of honour, punishing evil and enforcing justice as he sees fit. Wufei prefers to operate solo, since he has little patience for lesser warriors. These high standards make him equally contemptuous of his own failings in battle. The only ally he trusts is his Shenlong Gundam, which he has nicknamed \"Nataku\" after a hero of Chinese mythology.",
