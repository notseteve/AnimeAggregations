  "description" : "A specialized fighter aircraft created to support the Strike Gundam. The Skygrasper is designed to carry Striker packs out into the battlefield so that the Strike can replace its equipment in mid-battle, and the fighter itself can also use the Striker packs` weapons in combat. The Skygrasper`s built-in weaponry includes a powerful beam cannon and a pair of heavy machine guns, as well as weapons bays for storing bombs and missiles. Two Skygraspers are transferred to the Archangel when it joins with the Earth Alliance`s 8th Fleet, and after the ship descends to Earth, Mu La Flaga begins using one of these atmospheric fighters in place of his Moebius Zero mobile armour.",
