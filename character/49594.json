  "description" : "The \"true form\" of http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil] and http://anidb.net/ch49520 [Glavil], Gavigla is a mighty Protodeviln which combines the intelligence of one with the might and power of the other. He can produce energy waves which radiate outwards, destroying all in their path, as well as attacking in more conventional ways, crushing anything in his paws. He can easily survive a blast from the Macross Cannon, and the energy of Anima Spiritia has no apparent effect on him.\nSource: wiki",
