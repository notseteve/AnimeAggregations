Her fianc√© is Sai Argyle, as arranged for by their parents. She has received a love letter from Sai, which was mentioned in episode 1 of Gundam SEED. The only one of his friends she seems familiar with is Miriallia Haw, with whom she shares idle gossip shortly before ZAFT attacks Heliopolis. She only knows Kira Yamato as \"Sai`s friend\".
