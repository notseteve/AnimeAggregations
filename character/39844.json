  "description" : "Okonogi Momoe is a member of the Paranormal Investigations Club. She joined the club after she performed the \"hide the demon\" ritual one day, and feared she had been cursed as a result. The ritual didn`t really do anything but convince herself that she had been cursed, and Yuuko and Teiichi staged an elaborate ruse to make her believe that the \"curse\" had been lifted. She joined the club afterwards, and has been most enthusiastic in finding rumors of supernatural phenomena for the club to investigate. She admires Teiichi for what she sees as his resolve and courage, and seems to have quite a crush on him. She cannot see Yuuko, and even when Yuuko does strange things around her she attempts to rationalize them away, like most other people besides Teiichi and Kirie.",
