  "description" : "Irvine is an apostle who serves together with http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], http://anidb.net/ch91880 [Locus], http://anidb.net/ch91874 [Grunbeld] and http://anidb.net/ch91872 [Rakshas] under the reborn http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith] in his Band of the Hawk as captain of the archers.\nIrvine is a quiet, introverted man that primarily keeps to himself. He is committed to performing his role as a captain and is shown to take battles very seriously, carrying out orders quickly and efficiently at a moment`s notice. Aside from this, he doesn`t show much concern for other matters relating to the Band of the Hawk, preferring to distance himself from the other apostles when given leisure time. While on his own, Irvine enjoys hunting wildlife and camping in the woods whilst immersing himself in his only known pleasure: playing the lute by the campfire.\nAlthough he is an apostle, Irvine is shown to possess a tenderhearted side to his personality that he keeps hidden. This is shown briefly while taking care of http://anidb.net/ch87814 [Sonia] and protecting her from the cold. Irvine most likely keeps this side of himself hidden due to the fact that among apostles, such traits are incredibly rare and viewed as a form of weakness.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
