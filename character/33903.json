  "description" : "Ootori Fuyumi is Kyouya`s older sister. In the anime, she appears during Kyouya`s flashbacks about his first meeting with Tamaki. She clearly cares for her younger brother and tries to help him in life. She is somewhat lacking in the areas of housework and organization as any time she tries to help Kyouya packing clothes they ends up all over the place literally, but appears to be a kind-hearted person. The manga reveals that she is married, but returned home for a short visit. Her husband`s surname is Shido (矢道). She and Tamaki are pursuing a tour of commoners` food together.",
