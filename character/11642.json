  "description" : "Minatsu is a bold character and Student Council Vice-president. A tomboy with impressive athletic skills, and is surprisingly also good at maths, which Ken considers to be uncharacteristic of her. She`s popular among girls and has a bit of a yuri taste. She`s in the same class with Ken but she`s an orthodox tsundere without any `dere` to be found. She also has a little sister, Mafuyu. She`s very protective of Mafuyu and despises anyone who tries to hurt her. She is into Shounen manga and most of her suggestions tend to be based on typical Shounen manga plots. Minatsu and Ken met in the summer. Because of how she was, he looked up to her and to be like her. Their meeting taught him not to be lazy and work if he desires something. Like the season she represents, she`s fired up and is always ready to take action, especially when it has something to do with anime or manga.",
