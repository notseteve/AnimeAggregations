  "description" : "Pinocchio is a professional assassin with a near-fanatical devotion to his foster father, Christiano. Much like his namesake, Pinocchio wanted to repay the old man (in this case, Christiano) who \"created\" him. Years ago, Christiano and \"John Doe\", a former CIA agent, eliminated the Polacco family in their own house. Later, they found an unknown boy, speculated to be \"merchandise\" of the Polacco family, in a hidden cellar of the house. Although he originally intended to use the boy as a \"bargaining chip\", Christiano eventually decided to raise the boy as his own. Personally educated by Christiano and taught the skills of an assassin by \"John Doe\", the boy, now named Pinocchio, committed his first murder at the age of ten(not unlike the child assassins of Section 2). Pinocchio conducted many high-profile assassinations on his foster father`s behalf, including the murders of eight politicians, five judges, and four financiers of the Italian government.\nSource: Wiki",
