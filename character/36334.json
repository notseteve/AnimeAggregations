  "description" : "Genom is the primary manufacturer and distributor of the bio-organic constructs known as \"Boomers\". This makes Genom the primary enemy of the Knight Sabers - led by Sylia Stingray, daughter of the man who created the Boomers. In both versions of the series, Genom is run by a mysterious figure named Quincy, though the depiction of Quincy varies from one continuity to another (in the original series he was a dangerous, hands-on owner, while in Tokyo 2040 he is almost a puppet vegetable of a man, so old and decrepit he needs tubes and wires to keep himself alive while insanely dreaming of a boomer/human paradise). Brian J. Mason also works for Genom, and his schemes are either offshoots of or interference to Quincy`s.",
