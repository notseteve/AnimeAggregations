  "description" : "The leader of the Stormtroopers, whose nickname means \"eyeglasses\", he has a strong personality and generally directs the schemes of the Stormtroopers to gain Lum`s attention (though mostly for himself). Though usually antagonistic towards Ataru, he often hangs out with him in his spare time. He is often given to rambling philosophical musings and outbursts, and seems to have an affinity for fascism and communism.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
