  "description" : "Nunotaba Shinobu is a student from Nagatenjouki Academy, who worked on the Sisters` Radio Noise experiment before it was shut down.\nShe was called again when the Sisters project was revived to be used for the Level 6 Shift program.\nHowever, when she noticed the Sisters clones had something of a conscience, she was unable to see them as objects anymore. She attempted to stop the experiments by using envelopes containing cash cards to lure in witnesses in the unwatched alleyways, where the Sisters would fight Accelerator.\nShe does not appear to have any powers, but uses good acting to invoke fear into people and make them believe she has a deadly one.\nSource: wiki",
