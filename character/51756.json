  "description" : "Yamada is a classmate of Ishida and Asakura, with the appearance of a stereotypical nerd, wearing thick glasses and having prominent buck-teeth. Yamada dreams of opening a bookstore with Asakura, but Ishida violently \"kills\" him in a slapstick fashion every time the subject is brought up; Yamada will always appear unharmed in the next episode. He is a mechanical genius and once built a robot version of himself to fight Ishida.\nSource: Wiki",
