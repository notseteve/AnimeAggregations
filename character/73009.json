  "description" : "Ramos` Weepinbell was the second Pok√©mon revealed in the gym match against Ash Ketchum where it faced off against Ash`s Fletchinder. Ash`s Fletchinder had just defeated Ramos` Jumpluff and Clemont thought that as long as Ramos continued to use Grass types, Ash`s Fletchinder would have a clear advantage. Ash Ketchum also thought that he would be able to defeat Ramos with just Ash`s Fletchinder but Ramos` Weepinbell showed it was a strong opponent.\nRamos` Weepinbell was able to show it was fast as well but its combo of Poison Powder and Slam knocked out Ash`s Fletchinder and Ash`s Hawlucha before Ash`s Frogadier was able to defeat it.",
