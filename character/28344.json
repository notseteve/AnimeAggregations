  "description" : "Chief of Surgery at Eisler Memorial Hospital. He is the one who gets his orders from Director Heinemann. When it came to an opera singer named F. Rosenbach, he had Tenma operate on him while Dr. Becker handled the Turkish construction worker that came in first. When the Liebert Twins were brought in with Johan having a bullet wound to the head, he handed Dr. Tenma his phone where Director Heinemann tells him that Mayor Roedecker has suffered a cerebral clot and wants him to operate on him as Tenma objects stating that he`s the only one who can save Johan`s life. When Mayor Roedecker dies during surgery as a result of Tenma operating on Johan, he berates Tenma for letting Mayor Roedecker die. Dr. Oppenheim tells Tenma that he already informed Director Heinemann about this and tells Tenma that he has himself to blame for Mayor Roedecker`s death. When it came to the Liebert Twins, Director Heineman ordered Dr. Oppenheim to put Dr. Boyer in charge of watching over the twins upon hearing that Tenma was currently watching over them.\nAlongside Director Heinemann and Dr. Boyer, Dr. Oppenheim was later found dead when the three of them were mysteriously poisoned by candy left by Johan Liebert. Dr. Oppenheim`s death caused the Board of Directors to give Dr. Oppenheim`s position to Dr. Tenma.",
