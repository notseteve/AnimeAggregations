  "description" : "Dojima Yurika is portrayed as carefree, lazy, vain and immature; she would sooner go shopping than go on a mission. She is consistently late for work and rarely does anything around the office. When she does do work, she does as little as possible and leaves as soon as she is finished. She tells Robin that her parents have authority over the STN-J and had the STN-J act as her \"caretakers\". Dojima does not warm up to Robin at first, mockingly calling her Amon`s Girl, but towards the end of the series she begins to take a liking for Robin, calling her \"Little Robin\". As the series progresses, she begins take more responsibility for her work and proves she has more insight and perception of her surroundings than originally presumed.\nShe is revealed to be a Solomon intelligence operative, sent to the STN-J to uncover information about the Orbo.\nSource: Wikipedia",
