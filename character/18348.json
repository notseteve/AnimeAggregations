  "description" : "Kudou Yuuichi is a male honour student who is gay and in love with Suetake. He has poor self-control and is known as \"the nosebleed king\". Though Suetake is completely oblivious to Kudo`s affections, everyone else is aware of them, and they are constantly rolling their eyes over his actions (which is very similar to how they react to Kitagawa`s love for Mika, the only difference being that Mika is aware of Kitagawa`s feelings, but can do little to stop her advances). He is seen having fantasies about Suetake, and not much else.",
