Chiharu is often in charge of stopping Takashi when he starts spinning lies about the history of objects and events. Though she is regularly seen jokingly strangling him or dragging him away by his collar, they have been friends since kindergarten and are a couple.\nWhen Sakura is shown a world where everyone connected to the cards has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Chiharu and Takashi are shown reacting to one another as virtual strangers.",
