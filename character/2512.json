His ideal, which is to change history and achieve equality among humans with the Shinrabanshou, fascinates and wins the loyalty of many subordinates, for example Yukimi and Raikou. Hattori`s also known to have taken in many outcasts, such as Yukimi, Kazuho, Raikou and later Yoite, and offered them a place inside Kairoushuu.
