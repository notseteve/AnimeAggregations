  "description" : "Ladd is a sadistic hitman for the Russo family. His love for acts of violence truly shows in the maniacal glee he exhibits while fighting or killing. He is exceptionally skilled in hand-to-hand combat—particularly boxing—and the use of firearms. Ladd is deeply in love with his fiancée, Lua, although he expresses it through a passionate promise to kill her someday. After the Flying Pussyfoot incident, is thrown into Alcatraz prison for murder of the majority of the deceased on board the Flying Pussyfoot, despite pleading not guilty, the murders being in self-defence. This is technically true, since only one civilian was killed, and was killed by Dune, one of Ladd`s accomplices.",
