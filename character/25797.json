  "description" : "One of the \"Four Heavenly Kings,\" he is first shown to have great strength, like Toriko, carrying a Regal Mammoth with one arm (although this was merely a clever trick from using his monstrously strong hair, each one of its strings being strong enough to lift nearly 500 pounds). He is Rin`s older brother. He is a calm and collected pretty boy who judges the beauty of people`s actions and speaks in an elegant, almost flirting manner. He has a way of knocking without touching the target, mostly related to his \"sensor\" talent which allows him to know the physical state of those around him. His sensor is actually thousand upon thousands of super thin hairs that can reach a maximum of 25 feet (7.6 m) in length. Sani`s body has a very high body temperature and powerful sense of touch, being touched by his hair or any part of his body can only be described as Sani tasting whatever he is touching. He seeks \"harmony\" in his dishes, defined as the perfect use of ingredients, perfect handling of the food, and most importantly producing the prefect taste. He seems to be slightly in love with Komatsu (or at least his skills since they seem to produce the \"harmony\" Sani looks for in meals). When he sees Rin his calm personality disappears and is replaced by that of an over-protective older brother, shocked by how much weight she gained from eating too many sweets, leading to a comical sibling spat between them. He also expresses a great sense of disgust towards the Bishoku-kai, displaying anger after seeing the slaughtered creatures with a bite taken out of them that followed a GT Robo`s path of destruction. He and the other Four Heavenly Kings were trained by Ichiryuu, the president of the IGO.",
