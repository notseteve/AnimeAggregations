  "description" : "The Sunny Flower Agricultural Ship is an integral part of the colonization fleet, cultivating and raising agricultural products for the colonists. The main dome contains a man-made prairie for herding and grazing animals. There is also a leisure area open to the public featuring both a zoo and several campsite areas. A large portion of the Sunny Flower is devoted to holding food products, stocking various plant seeds and storing DNA samples required for transplanting plants and animals to the planet eventually chosen as a colony for the fleet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/sunnyflower.htm",
