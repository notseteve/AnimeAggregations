  "description" : "Hanzou is an 18-year old Jounin ninja from the Cloud Hidden Village whom has trained in the art of ninjutsu from the moment he could stand. He decided to become a Hunter in order to find the elusive Hermit`s Scroll. In the first part of the exam, which is a marathon, Hanzou is easily able to converse, while most of the others are breathless and struggling. In the second test, featuring cooking, he is the only one to know what sushi is, as it is a dish from his home country, Japan. He is the third candidate to clear the deadly traps and puzzles of the Trick Tower. In the final test of the Hunter Exam, Hanzou is forced to battle Gon. His speed, strength, and battle experience easily exceed that of Gon. However, the only way to pass the final test to is force your opponent to admit defeat - Gon refuses to do so even after being severely beaten. Hanzou breaks Gon`s arm to force him to admit defeat, but he still refuses. Noting the lack of hate in Gon`s eyes after this act, Hanzou realizes he actually has come to like him. He willingly bows out of the battle, giving Gon the victory needed for him to pass the final test. It is later stated by Wing that Hanzou learned Nen after the Hunter Exam, though he has yet to reappear in the series.\nSource: wiki",
