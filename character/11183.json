  "description" : "Dagmyer`s right-hand man and a student of Holy Land Academy. She has feelings for Dagmyer and appears to be more skilled than he is, as she managed to save him from some falling rubble while Kenshi (with Mexiah in his arms) was escaping from Wahanly`s Kikkoujin prototype, and again from near-death during Kenshi`s rampage in his Seikijin. She later begins to show feelings of concern towards Dagmyer as the show progresses. She regards Kenshi as someone who is kind and thankful to him for helping Dagmyer change his ways. At the end she kills Lan. Her Seikijin is red and pink equipped with a gunblade.\nSource: Wiki",
