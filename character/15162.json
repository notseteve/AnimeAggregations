  "description" : "A 24-year old singer and a self-claimed superstar. He`ll regularly hold concerts in the village but his song`s lyrics are mostly weird. He is in love with http://anidb.net/ch15159 [Nino] and is always jealous of http://anidb.net/ch15161 [Kou]. Under his star mask is a moon mask and under that is his real face who has red hair. When he becomes depressed he`ll start calling himself a seastar. He likes to go to the nearby convenient store and buy cigarettes. Four years ago he was a top-notched singer and supposedly constantly tops the Oricon charts. But he was bothered by the fact that he could never come up with his own songs. While feeling like this he met http://anidb.net/ch15159 [Nino] and he realized what he wants is music that he creates himself.",
