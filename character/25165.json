  "description" : "The Juunishinshou are the twelve warriors who swore to protect Oda Nobunaga at all costs. These twelve warriors are also connected to the twelve constellations of the zodiac. The four that appear in the Aokigahara Arc (Mekira, Kubira, Haira, and Indara) are substitutes for the real corresponding Juunishinshou, as they were imprisoned for their insatiable bloodlust at the time. In the Four Demons Arc, the Juunishinshou then appear as the antagonists.",
