  "description" : "As the New United Nations Earth consolidated its power in its plot for world domination during the post-7th Space War in the After War Era, the military began development of advanced new mobile weapons. When the crew of the Vulture land battleship Freeden learned of the existence of a new mobile suit equipped with the devastating satellite system and went to investigate, they were forced to surrender at the New UNE`s Zonder Epta base under the threat of the new GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X. However, the Freeden crew soon managed to make their escape, and Vulture pilot Garrod Ran captured the Gundam Double X for their own use.\nThe Double X was a great improvement over its GX-9900 Gundam X predecessor. It mounted a much more powerful twin satellite cannon, as well as improved hyper beam swords and a wide variety of hand armaments. However, one critical difference between the Double X and the GX was its lack of a flash system; instead, the recorded brainwaves of Jamil Neate - stored in the computer of his wrecked original Gundam X which was recovered by the New UNE - were recorded in the Double X`s control computer, allowing a non-Newtype pilot to activate the satellite system and fire the Double X`s twin satellite cannon. Like the Gundam X, a G-controller unit was required to activate the Double X and fire the twin satellite cannon. Fortunately for Garrod, his G-controller that he used on his old GX was compatible with the Double X, allowing him to use its devastating weapon. In the last battle of the 8th Space War, the Double X was severely damaged in a final duel with the Frost brothers.",
