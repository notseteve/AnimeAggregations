  "description" : "Aria is the former leader of Giglio Nero Famiglia and the 2nd Sky Arcobaleno. In the Future Arc, she was said to be dead due to an illness, most likely because Sky Arcobaleno are known for their short lifespans since she took on the curse. In Gamma`s flashback, she and Gamma had a close Boss and Subordinate relationship (implied in the manga to be romantically intimate).",
