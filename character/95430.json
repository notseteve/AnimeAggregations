  "description" : "Blue Rose is one of the only three adamantite adventurer groups in Re-Estize Kingdom, alongside Darkness and Red Drop. It is an all-female group, consisting of five members. They appear very close to one another, although, some of them occasionally end up bickering over mundane things. They were regarded as the strongest adventurers in Re-Estize, until Darkness arrived. Blue Rose is one of the few adventurer groups who were willing to take jobs that involve politics.\nSource: Wikipedia",
