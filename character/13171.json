  "description" : "Ilya Sokolov is a contractor with the Russian SVR. His ability is to shut off the brain functions of an individual, causing them to get deprived of oxygen and asphyxiate to death. Ilya is psychotic and cruel as well, which according to him, he has murdered many women just to watch them suffer. After he became a contractor, he became more \"rational\", and started using his abilities to let his victims achieve a physical high from the lack of oxygen before dying. He kidnaps Suou, Mao and July, intending to hand them over to his superiors, but Hei manages to intercept him. Without his contractor abilities, Hei almost loses to Ilya until he manages to strangle him to death with his grapple wire.",
