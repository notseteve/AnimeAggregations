It has black slits for nostrils on the tip of its muzzle. It has a large hump on its back with a several overlapping stripes that resemble an apple pie`s crust. It has red and green leaves on the top of its pie-like back.

The sweet nectar that covers its body increases in thickness, allowing it to absorb more damage than normal. It can shoot out nectar, enough to be able drown its opponents in the blast of nectar.\nAppletun is the only known Pokémon capable of using the move Apple Acid and exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Sweetness.",
