He has long hair with some pulled into a curled ponytail on the top of his head, and a wide smile filled with crooked teeth. When his powers a fully released, his \"Ice Fire\" makes his entire body burst into flames.\nLike all Akuma, Ice is bloodthirsty, but he is also shown to be a little simpleminded, playing \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" with his comrades to decide how to kill http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen].\nHe was shown to be terrified when Road gave him the order to self-destruct, though he obeyed anyway, having no choice. As he died, his soul reached out to Allen, begging for help.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki",
