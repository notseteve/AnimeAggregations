  "description" : "Elias Ainsworth is a magus, http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise]`s master and fianc√©e. He`s a being with both fae and human elements, and his origins are still a mystery. Known as the Thorn Sorcerer, the other faeries see him as an abomination, something he doesn`t mind. He`s also known as \"Pilum Murialis\" among wizards.\nHe can control and also turn himself into shadows, and when angry enough, he takes on a more monstrous form. He can even change his head to a human`s using magic. Despite claiming to lack human emotions, after some time caring for Chise he has slowly developed a true fondness for her. However, his innate lack of understanding certain human emotions makes Lindenbaum call him a child.\nHe dislikes children, saying they don`t have magic powers, but they are talented in being able to see the true nature of things.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
