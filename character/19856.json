  "description" : "A dead Vestrian female sailor whose ghost haunts Vestry`s underground cave with her fellow crew, and also the only one among them to actually possess the ability of materialization into a ghostly human form. Around 4 years before the 1st MÄR-Heaven war, Alma became Phantom`s sweetheart until Phantom took on the Zombie Tattoo from his Queen, Diana. An argument soon broke out between the two, and as Alma realized she (and her viewpoint of life and humankind in general) couldn`t shake his steadfast belief in the magnificence of immortality in the least, she bade Phantom farewell, never again met him . Alma and the crew of her ship died in the 1st War and, by the King of Chess Pieces himself, cursed to be wandering ghosts sealed inside the underground cave (in which approximately 2 years before she`d departed with Phantom) along with the Holy ÄRM Purific Ave it hid. 6 years later, at the prelude of the 2nd War Game, Ginta & co. arrived at Vestry and ventured into the cave to defeat the two Chess Bishops responsible for rampaging Vestry, Orco and Girom. Heeding their beg for freedom, after defeating Girom, Ginta cleared the blocked end of the cave, opening the way for the ship to depart. As a token of gratitude (and also in a hope to stop Phantom, Alma gave him one magic stone and the Purific Ave and ascended to heaven. Alma made a reappearance exclusive to the anime in the Ghost Chess attack, transporting Ginta and Dorothy back to Phantom`s fortress after they were expelled out of there to her cave by the Ghost Chess. After the attack, she also appeared before Phantom and by assuring him he was not at all unloved, helped his soul achieve salvation before he died.",
