  "description" : "Tamayo is 13 years old and is a friend and classmate of Misaki. She nicknames Misaki \"Misakichi\" and is rather eccentric. One of her favorite activities is practicing her martial arts techniques on her unwilling friend Kotarou. She always loudly cheers for Misaki at Angelic Layer matches and defends her against those who question her ability.\nThe various martial arts Tamayo has mastered after eight years of hard training are: wrestling, karate, K-1, kenpou, boxing, judo, capoeira, and taekwondo.\nIn the anime, it is later revealed that Tamayo has always held intimate feelings for Kotarou, while in the manga, she only saw him as a close friend. She offers to be Misaki`s \"second\" in her national game match against the Angelic Layer Company`s angel due to Hatoko becoming ill before Misaki accepts Oujiro`s offer to be her second.\nIn the anime she finally ends up with Kotaro after finally telling him how she feels (despite the fact Kotaro initially liked Misaki). However, in the manga, Tamayo falls in love with Oujiro Mihara.",
