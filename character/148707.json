  "description" : "Ugumori Souichi is a wealthy man whose daughter, http://anidb.net/ch148711 [Ayano], disappears without a trace while attending a summer festival at a local shrine, as if she was \"spirited away\". Mr. Ugumori is utterly devastated as years before the same thing happened to his wife, http://anidb.net/ch148708 [Etsuko], and he hasn`t heard from her since.\nIn reality both his wife and his daughter are alive and well. Upon reunion he learns that it was his fault for their disappearance. For years he has turned a blind eye to the abuse that Etsuko received on a daily basis from his mother. Finally understanding what he had done he apologised to Etsuko and they were family once again.",
