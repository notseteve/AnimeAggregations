  "description" : "Jolteon is one of the evolutions of Eevee that is caused by radiation from a thunder stone. Jolteon is covered with spiky, bright yellow fur, with white spiky fur surrounding its neck. Its fur sparks with electricity constantly; it can be soft to the touch or turn into sharp needles that can be fired when it is angered. Jolteon is able to gather negative ions from the atmosphere, using the resulting electricity to create lightning bolts of up to 10,000 volts. Its individual cells also create small electrical charges on their own, which combined with the static electricity caused by its body can result in powerful electric-type attacks. It`s very sensitive which causes it to constantly charge as it quickly changes moods. It can also make lightning and cause small thunderstorms. In the Pok√©mon video games, Jolteon can absorb electric attacks and turn them into HP (Health Point, or Health) with the ability `Volt Absorb`.",
