  "description" : "After watching an interview with a person rescued by the Dragon Pokémon \"Kairyu\" on the news, Ash and Go get really interested in Kairyu and when Professor Sakuragi tells them that there`s rumored to be an \"island where only the Dragon Pokémon Kairyu live\", they immediately decide to go search for it. They head out to sea riding on Go`s newly caught Pokémon Jugon, but run into a sudden storm on the way. The two get swept away by the waves and wash ashore on an island, where they`re met by a group of them.\nAsh notices that the Dragonair that was taking them on a tour of the island was having problems learning to fly, so he decides to help it out with a training session and help it learn how to use Dragon Dance. Pikachu uses Electroweb as a trampoline to jump on and on one of its bounces, Ash saw that Dragonair was glowing and he told it to spin around. It learned Dragon Dance and finally learned to fly.\nTeam Rocket showed up and attempts to get all the Dragonite but Ash and Go confront them to rescue Dragonite. Team Rocket used a Wailord which created a huge wave that sent Ash flying. Dragonair tried to come to his rescue but it was too slippery for him to grab on to. It evolved into Dragonite and grabbed Ash before he fell into the sea. Dragonite then blasted Team Rocket off into the sky with Hyper Beam.\nAfter rescuing the other Dragonite, the Dragonite that Ash had befriended wanted to come with him, so Ash got out a Poké Ball and caught it.",
