  "description" : "An artillery mobile suit introduced in the earliest stages of ZAFT`s Earth invasion. The ZuOOT is based on the worker machines which were the ancestors of ZAFT`s military mobile suits. With its limited mobility and poor close combat capabilities, the ZuOOT is more like a movable gun turret than a true mobile suit, and this machine is used mostly to provide fire support from the rear. It can also transform into a tank mode equipped with caterpillar tracks, for greater stability while firing its cannons.",
