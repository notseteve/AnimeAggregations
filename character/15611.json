  "description" : "Though Elisa`s crystal blue eyes and golden blonde hair makes determination of a foreign ethnic heritage unquestionably obvious, the entirety of her upbringing has remained exclusively within Japan. Understandably her appearance is responsible for awkward first encounters, as erroneous assumptions that she is a tourist or foreign exchange student are common. Though individuals prejudicial would argue against it, Elisa is unconditionally Japanese in mind and soul, faithfully following the same lifestyle and customs as any young woman from the \"Land of the Rising Sun\".",
