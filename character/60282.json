  "description" : "Juubei, also known as Mitsuyoshi, is one of the Six Heroes and Ragna`s master who battled the Black Beast alongside Hakumen. As revealed in Phase 0, he was originally named Mitsuyoshi, and did not take up the name Juubei until after the Dark War. He is a beast-man and is the father of Kokonoe. It is also revealed that Taokaka and her clan were genetically engineered from his DNA. Despite his appearance (he is considerably short and does not come off as threatening, resembling a cat more than either of his descendants), he is a powerful warrior, with numerous characters referring to him as the most powerful being on the planet. He is armed with the Nox Nyctores Mucro Somino: Musashi, a pair of kodachi, one stored in each end of the sheath. Supposedly, its power is to cut \"what cannot normally be cut\", implied that it is able to destroy a magical field or barrier. He works to safeguard his friends in their times of need. An interesting fact to note is that Juubei is actually the one to finish the enemy in Taokaka`s Astral Heat. His former and current names are derived from the famous samurai Yagyuu Juubei Mitsuyoshi.",
