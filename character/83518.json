  "description" : "Mimika was controlled by three girls in their final year of high school named Mirei, Miruko, and Misaki. They shared the belief that they grew to become uninteresting girls that weren`t special in any way and felt that if they`d all created individual characters, they wouldn`t be able to progress very far in the game, so instead they took turns playing Mimika.\nSource: dothack.wikia.com",
