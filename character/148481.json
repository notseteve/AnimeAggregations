  "description" : "A-01 is a United Nations special-forces unit formed to carry out Alternative IV. It reports directly to Alternative IV`s executive officer, Professor Kouzuki Yuuko, and is tasked with absolute success rather than following any budgetary constraints. It originally began with an entire Wing of one-hundred and eight TSFs, of which the Valkyries eventually formed the 9th squadron. \nSource: Muv Luv Wiki",
