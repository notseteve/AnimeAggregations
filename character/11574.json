  "description" : "Jinguuji Kuesu is a daughter of another demon-slaying family, who seek to ally themselves with the Amakawa family through marriage. She appears to be part of Yuuto`s past and claims that Yuuto`s grandfather had promised their marriage. She is highly aggressive and assertive, going so far as to kiss Yuuto twice in front of Himari just to stake her claim. Unlike Yuuto, she is trained in her heritage, and is fully capable of fighting. The Jinguuji family is seen by the 10 other families as heretics for using Western magic. Her magical powers are rumoured to be as powerful as that of 10 people. She is clever but devious, she even went to the extent of offering Shizuku revenge against the decendant of the demon slayers that killed her clan, only to turn on her for following her instinct.\nAn interesting point of note is that Kuesu has a small crescent mark on her forehead, similar to the one that sometimes appears on the forehead of Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon. She too loves Yuuto. Among the girls, Kuesu has kissed Yuuto the most so far at 4 times and calls him Yuu-chan. She is also known as the Twilight Moon.",
