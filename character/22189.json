  "description" : "ZAFT`s newest underwater mobile suit. Unlike the earlier GOOhN model, the ZnO was designed specifically for close combat, in the expectation that the Earth Alliance would soon develop its own underwater mobile weapons. The ZnO is equipped with powerful claws, rather than standard manipulator hands, and the phonon maser cannons installed in its palms can be used for devastating point-blank attacks.",
