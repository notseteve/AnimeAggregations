  "description" : "The \"official\" DearS exchange student to Takeya`s high school, and Ren`s main rival. She was seen as a \"fake\" upon arrival, due to an enrollment mix-up with Ren entering the school. Eventually, she took it upon herself to train Ren to become a better DearS. This tutoring has the unpredicted side-effect of her seemingly developing feelings for Takeya. She initially mistakes this as the \"Gift\", though she later realizes that she was experiencing love. Miu has a bit of a tragic past when she was younger, when her former master, who was also her breeder, was brutally murdered by gun and she was unable to save him, despite her best efforts.",
