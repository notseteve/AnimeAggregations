  "description" : "In his previous assignment as a test pilot, Sanders has already become one of the Federation`s first mobile suit aces. However, his skill as a pilot is accompanied by a grim jinx; each time Sanders joins a new team, his comrades are wiped out on their third mission together. When Shiro saves him en route to Earth, Sanders tags along and becomes a member of the 08th MS Team, hoping that his optimistic new friend can help him break his \"Team Killer\" curse. Loyal and serious, Sanders usually plays a support role in combat, carrying ammunition and spare weapons in his Gundam`s cargo container.",
