  "description" : "Also known as \"Kojirou\", he is the kendo instructor, and also a teacher of politics and economics, at Muroe High School. He is perpetually impoverished and lives from paycheck to paycheck, often taking handouts of food from his students. He is offered the chance of a lifetime from an old senpai â€” a year`s supply of sushi if his female kendo team can beat his senpai`s in a practice tournament. This inspires Kojirou to put an effort into training his team, much to the delight of his most dedicated student, Kirino Chiba. The only person who knows the real reason for Kojirou`s inspiration is Yuuji Nakata, who calls him \"pathetic\".",
