  "description" : "Chief Inspector Kosaka Shintaro is a short-tempered man working directly under Zaizen. He updates Zaizen on the organization`s progress as well as other related information. He is usually seen criticizing the employees while they are investigating a case or not doing work when he thinks they should. He constantly yells and scolds them, and he mostly fusses over his secretary Shohei Hattori and Dojima. Although he may be an annoyance to the rest of the Hunters, he shows some concern for them. Originally a member of the city police force, he possesses connections the hunters use when the STN-J are unavailable.\nAt the series` conclusion, he is the STN-J`s new administrator.\nSource: Wikipedia",
