During practice for an upcoming recital, Maika injures her foot and has to resign from being the prima donna in the performance. A X Chara is born from her shock and disappointment, which Amu heals. Maika starts out with an arrogant personality, but after the ordeal she compliments Yaya`s performance as the substitute prima donna and displays a much friendlier attitude.",
