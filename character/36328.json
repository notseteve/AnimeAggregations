  "description" : "A Gourmet Living National Treasure, Setsuno is Jirou`s long-time partner, and has the same Full-Course Meal as him. She has the skill and capability of easily doing the work of eight top-level chefs. Setsuno attempts to recreate the legendary Century Soup Jirou gave to her at some point; however, it is incomplete and she requests Toriko and Komatsu to find the missing ingredient after being impressed by their relationship and strong knowledge and respect of the gourmet ingredients. Although an old woman, she still has incredible power, breaking all of Alfaro`s Plate Shuriken from far away without seeming to move, and is one of the few people brave enough to call the Bishoku-kai boss an \"idiot.\" However, she has still lost some of her power since her early days, losing some of her ability to let her Gourmet Cells \"adapt.\" This is characterized by her having \"White Breath\" in Ice Hell, meaning her Cells did not adapt to the cold environment and warm her body accordingly. Melk the First said that the knife of Setsuno is one of the few knives he got a shock from after seeing.",
