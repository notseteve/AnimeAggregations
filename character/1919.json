  "description" : "Emiya Kiritsugu is a professional assassin and hitman. He dedicated most of his life to becoming a \"hero of justice\", a defender of humankind, through killing people who tended to bring catastrophe or war. He eventually noticed that he would never be able to do that with human abilities alone, and sought the miracle of the Holy Grail to stop conflict. In the aftermath of the 4th Holy Grail War, he saved the life of http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou], later becoming the boy`s foster father and finally giving up on his quest. He is also a magus, but he never made any serious attempts to train the unskilled Shirou in his craft, in spite of the latter`s insistent requests. He dies in the years between the 4th and 5th Holy Grail Wars.",
