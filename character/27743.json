  "description" : "Originally Kunieda Aoi`s second-in-command, Nene is far more aggressive than her permissive leader. Though she often openly disagrees with and occasionally disobeys Kunieda, she is still her faithful wingman, balking vociferously when Kunieda opts to leave the Red Tails and relinquish the mantle of leadership to her. Her weapon of preference are chains, which she uses proficiently to gain an advantage against stronger men.",
