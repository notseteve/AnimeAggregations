  "description" : "Like the Freedom Gundam, this prototype mobile suit was developed using captured Earth Alliance technology, and it has an effectively unlimited energy supply thanks to its Neutron Jammer Canceler and nuclear engine. The Justice Gundam carries the same beam rifle, beam sabers, and anti-beam shield as the Freedom, and its shoulders house a pair of beam boomerangs inspired by the Sword Strike Gundam`s Midas Messer. The Fatum-00 flight support unit attached to its back is armed with a pair of powerful beam cannons, and can detach to serve as a remote-controlled flying platform. The Justice is assigned to ZAFT pilot Athrun Zala in order to pursue and destroy the stolen Freedom.",
