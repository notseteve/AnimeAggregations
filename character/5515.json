  "description" : "The benevolent Bandit of the Wilderness and a friendly rival to Leina who, following the tournament, resumed her training. As a result, her muscle strength increased to the point where she discards her mace for hand-to-hand combat. Following Queen Claudette`s reign of terror on the Continent, she founded the Rebel Army, funded by the distribution of dark magic stones. However, she was captured by the Queen`s Army after the Swamp Witch, during a \"Beautiful Fighter Hunt\", cast an \"indomitable curse\" on her that made her unable to eat or sleep. Although she has been weakened after a long stay in prison, her fighting strength still remains.\nSource: Wiki",
