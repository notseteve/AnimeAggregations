  "description" : "The main protagonist of Lovely Complex, Risa Koizumi is not your average Japanese high school student. Standing 172cm tall, Risa`s height is well above that of most Japanese girls her age (the average height for a female is 157cm). Ironically, her surname means `little spring`. She and other characters compare her to a giraffe. Risa can be impulsive and strong-willed at times, and is rarely willing to display her softer side.",
