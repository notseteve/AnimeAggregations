  "description" : "Riki, or \"Riki the Dark\" has been called the `charisma` of the slums. He was the leader of Bison, a gang in Ceres, and eventually became Iason Mink`s pet, which had a crushing effect to his human pride. Riki is proud, rebellious, fierce and defiant, but his experiences change him. Some men living in the slums feel he has lost his spark. He is torn between his pride and the feelings he has for Iason that he is unwilling to acknowledge.",
