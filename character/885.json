  "description" : "Hiromi is a girl Shin`ichirou`s age and goes to the same high school as him. After her father died, she came to live with Shin`ichirou`s family and has already been living with them for a year when the story begins. She has been in the same class as Shin`ichirou since elementary school, though despite being cheerful back then, she now acts cold when living at his home. In contrast, she normally smiles and is popular at school. She often helps out with Shin`ichirou`s father`s work as they are low on man power. She is a very good player on her school`s girl`s basketball team and is number six. It is clear that Hiromi has feelings for Shin`ichirou, but she decided to lock these feelings inside when she began living with Shin`ichirou.\nIt is suggested that she hides these feelings because Shin`ichirou`s mother told her, prior to the start of the story, that Shin`ichirou is her brother, which is later proven false.",
