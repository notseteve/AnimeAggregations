  "description" : "This attack mobile suit, was jointly developed by the AEUG resistance group and their corporate sponsor Anaheim Electronics. Thanks to the participation of former Zeon engineers, its appearance is reminiscent of Zeon`s Rick Dom series. The Rick Dias is the first mobile suit armoured with lightweight Gundarium Gamma alloy, allowing it to carry a larger propellant supply without sacrificing speed or manoeuvrability, and this formidable machine becomes the weapon of choice for the AEUG`s veteran pilots. While the Rick Dias is initially produced in a black colour scheme, Quattro`s trademark red hues soon become its standard colours.",
