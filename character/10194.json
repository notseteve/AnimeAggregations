  "description" : "Kuze Hideo is a fictional character in http://anidb.net/cr871 [Shirow Masamune]`s Ghost in the Shell anime series http://anidb.net/a1176 [Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig]. Kuze is a full cyborg and is a main suspect in http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9]`s investigation of the Individual Eleven. He is unusual among prostheticized individuals since he has chosen to have a sculpted face, which is far more difficult to manipulate than a standard prosthetic face. Due to this, Kuze`s mouth typically remains motionless while he speaks.\nKuze Hideo is one of the members of the terrorist group known as the \"Individual Eleven\". During a mass suicide by the Individual Eleven, Kuze alone survived, leaving and hiding out in the Refugee Residential District. He spearheads a revolutionary socialist independence movement by the refugees in Japan.",
