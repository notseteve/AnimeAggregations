  "description" : "A gunman who has undergone substantial genetic alterations and implants. He has a collar fused into the back of his neck, as well as healing abilities that allow him to quickly regenerate from almost any injury. As a child, he murdered his younger \"sister\" Lily, another genetic experiment, in a berserk rage. This has caused him to develop an extreme fear towards women, to the point where he goes into a mental breakdown when one gets too close to him. Usually emotionally distanced from others, he has another \"personality\" which enjoys violence and destruction.",
