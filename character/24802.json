  "description" : "When http://anidb.net/ch23402 [Watashi] was still a young boy, his father found Kaatan as a young kappa, crying on the hill behind their house. After that, he was brought up almost as Watashi`s elder brother (as kappas grow much faster than humans). He was with the family for the passing of Watashi`s grandfather and father, and now stays with his aging mother.",
