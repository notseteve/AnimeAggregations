  "description" : "Poisonee is featured in episodes 12 through 20 and is the only woman of the five. Instead of making a big show of calling on Zakenna like Pisard and Gekidorago, she snaps her fingers and is much more discreet about it. She often takes on a human appearance to gain the trust of the girls before attacking. In her true form, she resembles a vampire: She is pale, dresses in black, wears a cape and has fangs, dark-rimmed yellow and red eyes and long red hair.",
