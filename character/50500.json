  "description" : "The Auerst채dt was a refitted super-scale nuclear missile submarine (formerly of the Russian armed forces) that was operated by the Anti-United Nations. Deployed as a submarine aircraft carrier, the Auerst채dt carries SV-51 variable fighters in pressure-resistant capsules. When carrying several SV-51 units specially modified for underwater launching the Auerst채dt can deploy its variable fighters while submerged (surfacing only to effect retrieval). The submarine carrier is also equipped with advanced radar systems and is capable of defense using torpedoes. The Auerst채dt proved an elusive weapon of the Anti-U.N. Forces during operations near the island of Mayan in 2008.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/auerstadt.htm",
