Over time, Allen formed a very strong bond with Mana, though had initially been annoyed with him. Eventually, Mana died of a carriage accident and Allen turned him into an http://anidb.net/t6684 [Akuma]. Mana sliced through Allen`s left eye, cursing him and marking it with a pentacle. He was quickly destroyed by Allen`s awakened anti-Akuma weapon, but not before his original self forced its way to the surface to tell Allen that he loved him.\nHe is allegedly the older brother of the http://anidb.net/ch84636 [14th Noah], http://anidb.net/ch84602 [Nea D. Campbell]. Mana also taught Allen the \"notes\" on the 14th`s music score. According to http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross], Mana began to lose his grip on reality by the time Allen was adopted, undermining Allen`s belief that Mana truly loved him, instead of loving the Noah that Allen possessed. His name was later revealed to be Mana D. Campbell, and he was actually a personality of the Millennium Earl himself subconsciously created to approach Allen.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
