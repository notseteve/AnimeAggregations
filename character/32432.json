  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka]`s younger sister; she is a student in middle school, but nonetheless joins the http://anidb.net/ch37939 [club]. She is very close to her brother, who she calls \"An-Chan\", and behaves in a jealous and clingy way whenever she feels that he is not giving her the attention she deserves, to the point where it is obvious that she has a brother complex. She sees http://anidb.net/ch32434 [Maria] as a rival for Kodaka`s brotherly affections and so often gets into fights with the latter. Despite being older than Maria she has smaller breasts than her, which Maria is always eager to point out.\nShe has a penchant for darkness, vampires and the macabre ever since she started watching an anime called Full Metal Necromancer. As a result she often speaks in an affected fashion, and claims to be known as \"Reisys VI Felicity Sumeragi\", an ancient vampire who has lived for ten thousand years, and wears a gothic dress and red contacts, but this facade quickly breaks down when she gets emotionally worked up and she speaks in a strong Kyushu accent. Indeed, her behavior does not for the most part differ from that of a regular girl (procrastinating with her homework, staying inside when it is hot, etc.) which Kodaka points out, causing her to be embarrassed and slightly lose character.\nMoreover, she is not very good at mathematics, taking a long time to solve a question Kodaka posed to her, and displays rather limited vocabulary, frequently getting words wrong.\nSource: Wiki",
