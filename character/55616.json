  "description" : "Hato is a first year male student and the last to join during Ogiue`s first membership drive. Although he is heterosexual, Hato shares the fujoshi love of yaoi and boy`s love manga and doujinshi, making him a \"fudanshi.\" Because of this, Hato decided to adopt a female persona, complete with a near perfect female voice, and only attends Genshiken meetings as a girl, though he attends classes as a guy. Even after the members of Genshiken learn his secret, Hato continues to cross-dress for the meetings, leading Genshiken to draft former member Madarame into letting Hato change at his apartment.\nSource: Wiki",
