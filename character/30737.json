  "description" : "Antonio Lopez is one of the secondary characters of the series \"Tiger & Bunny\" and the one behind the guise of the Hero Rock Bison. As a NEXT he possesses Impenetrable Skin, a power that, once activated, grants the user invulnerability from harm. He is a close friend of Kotetsu and often goes out to have a drink with him. Contrary to his tough appearance, Antonio`s personality has a fragile side to it. He has gained the nickname \"Bull Tank of the West Coast\" because of how he charges through enemies using his thick-head, or giant drill shoulders.",
