  "description" : "A crybaby who is nonetheless capable of exceptional courage and leadership ability when the situation calls for it. At first, Jacuzzi seems almost cripplingly shy, even with a tendency to stutter in front of strangers. However, when his loved ones are in danger, he will summon the strength to face his problems directly, even though he`ll continue to cry. After a member of his gang was killed, Jacuzzi robbed a record number of neighbourhood stores, clutching a machine gun as tears stream down his face. Jacuzzi went out and received his \"sword tattoo\" on his face when Nice was injured in an explosives accident,so that they would both be similarly marked.",
