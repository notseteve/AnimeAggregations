  "description" : "Blacephalon has a humanoid figure with a slender torso and wide hips. Its legs are white with balls on the front, a pink one on the left leg and a blue one on the right leg. Its feet are shaped as if it is wearing high-heeled boots with pointed tips. The main body is yellow with alternating pink and blue stripes. It has a white ball on its chest and one as a tail. Its right arm is pink and its left arm is blue. Its hands are white and have frills on the wrists. A larger frill is around its neck and in the middle is a hole - the shape of the ripples change slightly depending on Blacephalon`s mood.\nFor a head, Blacephalon has a white ball with a multitude of pink and blue dots that can change color to reflect its emotions and are supposedly made of tiny sparks. On both sides of the ball are stars with an alternating pink and blue color pattern - the tapering on the ends of these also changes depending on Blacephalon`s mood. In the middle of these stars are yellow spots which may be Blacephalon`s eyes. Blacephalon`s head is not attached to the body, and can grow or shrink in size when it attacks.\nBlacephalon is known to trick its targets through the foppish way it walks before blowing its head up without warning in order to steal their vitality. This Ultra Beast can freely move its head around easily and regenerate after blowing it up.\nBlacephalon is the only known Pok√©mon capable of learning the move Mind Blown.",
