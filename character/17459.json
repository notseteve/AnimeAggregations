  "description" : "A boy in the year below Amu at school. He performs on television as the masked magician Zero, and only the guardians know his identity. Takuya at one time had a Shugo Chara named Zero (his namesake) but he believed him to be an imaginary friend. He wants to become a first-class magician, but his producer insists on using CG to create a more flashy show. Because he is unable to follow his dream and is no longer smiling, he cannot see his Shugo Chara anymore.\nDue to Nikaido`s meddling, Zero eventually becomes a X Chara that Amu heals. Afterward Takuya is able to see Zero again, if only for a moment, and receives his encouragement.",
