  "description" : "Ootori Gakuen Seitokai (Ohtori Academy`s Student Council) play a vital role in the series. Moved by his or her own personal interests, their great objective is to bring \"World Revolution\" and in order to obtain it, a true champion must rise from their battles to obtain possession of the Rose Bride. Instructed by letters sent from an entity called \"End of the World\", each of them possesses a rose signet ring similar to the one Utena received from her prince, allowing them to participate in the duels. Some view Utena only as a threat to their plans, while others develop some sympathy for her. During the duels, they place on their chests a single rose that matches the colour of their hair or clothing.\n\"If the egg`s shell does not break, the chick will die without being born. We are the chick; the egg is the world. If the world`s shell does not break, we will die without being born. Break the world`s shell! For the sake of revolutionising the world!\" - Ootori Gakuen Seitokai oath (paraphrased from Hermann Hesse`s Demian).",
