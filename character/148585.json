  "description" : "Hara Kowashi is a classmate of http://anidb.net/ch142873 [Otogi Morihito] and http://anidb.net/ch142875 [Wakatsuki Nico]. He has a weak stomach that gets upset easily so he often has to go to the toilet.\nBecause of this during his childhood years he had a nickname Unkoman ウンコマン, which roughly translates to \"poop-man\".\nHe has a habit to overuse \"katakanized\" neologisms in his speech.\nHaving a trauma since early age he was very hesitant to ask permission to go to the toilet during class. To solve this problem he asked Nico to put a spell on him that would mask his existence so he could leave the class untroubled and avoid the shame.\nTrivia: his name is a pun on the phrase hara o kowasu 腹を壊す meaning `to get an upset stomach`.",
