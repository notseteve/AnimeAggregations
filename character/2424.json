  "description" : "A native of the Side 2 space colonies, Shiro personally witnessed the carnage of the war`s first weeks, an experience which filled him with hatred for the Zeons. Now, freshly graduated from officer school, he`s been transferred to Earth to take command of the Kojima Battalion`s 08th MS Team. While Shiro is a talented pilot with a knack for creative tactics, his inexperience as an officer and fondness for fuzzy inspirational speeches at first earn the scorn of the 08th MS Team`s veteran members. Meanwhile, his chance encounter with an enemy pilot leads Shiro to question his own determination to wage war.",
