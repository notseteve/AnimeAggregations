  "description" : "Larry lived in seclusion deep within a forest in the Isshu region with Meloetta. One day the place was discovered and while he wasn`t looking, Meloetta was captured by a group of villains. Since ancient times, he and his people have been called the Guardians, which are a group of people that guard Meloetta. The Guardians possess the power to sense Meloetta. He had been searching for a long time to find it after it was taken by the Rocket gang.\nWhen Larry heard Meloetta`s melody, he quickly followed the sound and accused Ash and his friends of stealing Meloetta. The matter was quickly resolved though and he apologized for his initial quick judgement. After Rocket Gang decided to go ahead with their \"Operation Tempest\", Larry helped out the group defeat Rocket Gang. He was able to control the Reveal Glass and requested that it soothe the rage that was shaking heaven as Landlos, Tornelos and Voltolos withdrew.\nLarry then parted ways with Ash and his friends as he left with Meloetta after it was rescued. He hoped to return to their quiet life.",
