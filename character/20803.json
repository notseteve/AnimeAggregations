  "description" : "Iwanbou is a fat oaf who uses his immense size, his strength, and his ability to entrap weapons in his flab. He is armed with small blades worn on his fingertips. He is very stupid, and, apart from taking part in the battle of Aoi-Ya as well as grinning like an utter idiot, he does not say anything, and he does not do anything. He was last seen on a cliff outside of Kyoto. Iwanbou`s only weapons were the metal nails on the end of each of his fingers that could cause damage. It is also noted that Iwanbou`s skin was thick enough to withstand attacks.\nAs revealed in the Jinchuu, or \"Revenge\" arc of the manga, Iwanbou is in reality a mechanical puppet, a primitive mech, controlled by Gein, the puppetmaster. Gein reappears in this arc as one of the six comrades in a more dangerous form of Iwanbou and plays a major role in Enishi`s revenge.",
