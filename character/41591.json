  "description" : "Miyu (\"beauty of the evening\"; 山野美夕 = Yamano Miyu when acting a human being) is a beautiful girl who appears to be around 13 (in the OVA) or 15 (in later volumes of the manga) years old but in fact is much older, being a \"Daywalker\", i. e. half-vampire (her mother was human). She can teleport, levitate, open dimensional portals and use fire attacks; she needs blood to survive but is not harmed by sunlight, holy water or crucifixes, and her reflection can be seen.\nMiyu has been tasked with being the successor of her father as the \"Guardian\", sending \"stray Shinma\" (which are living in the world of humans, thus violating the treaty between humans and shinma) back to \"The Darkness\".",
