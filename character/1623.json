  "description" : "Meaning \"Spiral Face\", the Lazengann is Lord Genome`s personal Gunman, using his consorts as batteries. It is very similar to the Gurren-Lagann and has the same abilities that the Lagann can use (by extension, it also proves immune to being controlled by the Lagann Impact attack). However, it is much stronger and can use more powerful drill techniques, as well as defend against the Gurren-Lagann`s techniques with ease.\nIn the end, it took the Lagann on its own to severely damage the Lazengann. The mecha was later recreated as part of the Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, used in the desperation move Lazengann Overload to convert itself and the energy from the Grand Zamboa`s Infinity Big Bang Storm into pure Spiral Energy, taking the form of a gigantic drill with Lord Genome`s head on the tip that is ingested by the Tengen Toppa`s abdominal mouth.",
