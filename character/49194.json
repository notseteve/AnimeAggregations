  "description" : "These small and deadly unmanned fighters were used extensively by the U.N. Forces, mostly as training craft. At some 10-12 meters in length, this small aircraft featured a retractable small-bore beam cannon under the front nose and could carry up to six AIM-225 high-maneuverability missiles upon the dorsal/ventral wing hardpoints. Typically, the drone fighter was not outfitted with live ammunition and carried mostly unarmed missiles used specifically in combat exercises. The drone fighter required the use of specialized equipment to land and to transport into combat zones so these fighters were often dependent upon larger aircraft for proper deployment. A small boom mounted on the dorsal fuselage was used to mount the drone fighter under the wings of larger carrier craft, like the http://anidb.net/ch49192 [SB-10/10 Starwing Bomber], and thus carry the craft much like ordnance.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/dronefighter.htm",
