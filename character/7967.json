  "description" : "Pen Pen (often styled as PenÂ²) is a \"hot spring penguin\" and Misato`s pet. He lives in a custom refrigerator in Misato`s apartment, enjoys taking warm baths, eating whatever food he can get his hands (or wings) on, and going to hot springs. He also appears to have a relatively high degree of intelligence, as he is also shown watching TV and reading newspapers. He is voiced by Megumi Hayashibara in the Japanese series. He is the result of a genetics experiment at Misato`s former workplace, and she adopted him after the experiment`s conclusion rather than let him be euthanised. His wingtips have retractable claws, which normal birds do not have.",
