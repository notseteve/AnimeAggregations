She considers http://anidb.net/ch40602 [Seiryuu]`s plan of using http://anidb.net/ch5895 [Kyouta] as mindbreaker the perhaps only way of retrieving http://anidb.net/ch40649 [Benzaiten] but fears that the boy would be no match for http://anidb.net/ch40680 [Saraswati] yet, and premature action would only make things worse now.",
