  "description" : "Seven years later, Rossiu recovered Lordgenome`s brain and regrows the likeness of Lordgenome`s head from a tissue sample collected from the Spiral King`s corpse. This is done because Lordgenome`s memories could not be accessed directly from a normal computer, so a special \"Bio-Computer\" had to be built to allow Lordgenome to relay his memories personally to the curious. Once activated, the bemused Bio-Computer explains the existence of the Anti-Spirals to Rossiu, and later serves as a power source for Arc Gurren when the Mugan have overrun Kamina City. The Bio-Computer`s information later proves invaluable, helping to prevent the moon drop and provide the means to reach the Anti-Spiral`s pocket dimension.\nHowever, though programmed without a personality, Lordgenome eventually regains self-awareness and assumes the identity of the man he used to be, joining as navigator of the newly recommissioned Chouginga Gurren just to finally come face to face with the Anti Spiral. Once Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann is formed, Lordgenome uses the Super Spiral Space`s power to temporary recreate his body to serve as one of the thirteen key pilots. He then later detaches Lazengann Overload to block the Grand Zamboa`s Infinity Big Bang Storm and wilfully sacrifices himself to convert the massive attack and himself into a galaxy-sized drill of Spiral Energy that Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann absorbs to ensure Lordgenome`s intent of paving a path for the spiral beings of future generations.",
