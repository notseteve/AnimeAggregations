  "description" : "Sasame is the Knight of Sound and has a job as a radio personality, addressing people`s problems on the air. He is a reported flirt, with the other knights referring to him as a playboy, but he also is a good listener and offers himself as a sounding board to Himeno. He later becomes Fenrir`s Knight of Darkness after confessing that he was in love with Takako 16 years ago, pitting him against the Leafe Knights and the Pr√©tear. In the anime adaptation, his personality is changed to a quieter, more serious nature, and he is given an older appearance.",
