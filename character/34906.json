  "description" : "Scarlett Church does not seem to be the nicest member of the team and is the team leader. When Koto asks if she is a cosplayer as well, she hits her. She is cold and distant, and trains Koto in a very harsh way, even going as far as to drive a car at her in order to get her to transform. Even when Koto does transform, she is not impressed, stating that it is incomplete. She tells Koto to call her \"Mistress\", but upon seeing Koto battle, decides to let her call her \"Onee-Sama\". She has romantic feelings for Kurusu, or Crus-sama as the group call him, but knows she cannot love him until the mission is over. Her name is a play on Charlotte Church.\nWikipedia",
