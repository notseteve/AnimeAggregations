  "description" : "The Gaia Gundam is a prototype mobile suit developed by ZAFT as part of its new Second Stage series. Designed for close combat on land, it can change into a four-legged mobile armor form that resembles the BuCUE used during the previous war, and in this form it can use the beam blades installed in its attitude control wings to slice through enemy mobile suits. After the Gaia Gundam is captured during the attack on Armory One, it is assigned to Stella Loussier of the Phantom Pain special forces unit.",
