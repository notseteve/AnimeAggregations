  "description" : "Fernando was first seen battling in the stadium at the Kentauros Battles at the trade meet festival in a town near Kogane City. When Ash and his friends came to watch the battle, they saw Fernando win his fifth consecutive victory with his Tauros. Ash was excited to battle after watching Fernando and he got Professor Samual Oak to transfer his Tauros over so he could battle. When Ash returned to the stadium, Fernando had just won his 10th consecutive win and the announcer was just about to declare him the victor as there was no more challengers.\nAsh challenged Fernando to a battle but having won 10 battles already Fernando was quite confident. The battle didn`t last too long and it looked like Fernando`s Tauros was going to win but in a last effort, Ash`s Tauros used Take Down which flipped over Fernando`s Tauros and gave Ash the win.",
