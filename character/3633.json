  "description" : "Current head of the Vongola crime family. He uses a sceptre as his primary weapon. It is implied that he is becoming too weak to lead the family, and thus accepted Iemitsu`s son, Tsuna, as the next head of the Vongola Family. However, Xanxus, his adopted son, deemed himself more worthy to become the next boss, so he kidnapped and replaced IX with a fake, who sanctioned the traditional Vongola Tournament.",
