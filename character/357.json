  "description" : "Drowzee is a creature with an elephant`s trunk, the body and color pattern of a tapir, and a hunger for dreams, traits that characterize Drowzee. Its name comes from the English word \"drowsy\", which reflects on the fact that Drowzee`s primary ability is to put foes to sleep. The \"-zee\" comes from the sleeping phrase \"ZzZzZ\". Its Japanese name, Sleepe, is a corruption of the English word sleep. Drowzee`s original biology was based on the tapir and its appearance and dream-eating behavior are inspired by the Japanese folkloric creature Baku. However, its nature is much unlike the real-world animal it was based on.\nDrowzee eats dreams; in order to eat, it must put its prey to sleep. A nightmare or night terror will give it indigestion, and it prefers the dreams of human children to those of adults or other pokémon. It`s psychic, but it has limited abilities, compared to other Pokémon; it does not display telekinesis, for example. However, its telepathy allows it to detect people who are asleep, even while asleep itself. Its memory when it comes to dreams is eidetic, and it has the ability to show anyone any dream it has eaten. If one thinks he/she had a good dream, but is unable to remember it, it was possibly eaten by a Drowzee.",
