  "description" : "Sanjuro is a Heavy Blade modeled after a Ronin, or wandering Samurai. He is a rugged looking warrior of indeterminate age who wears dark platemail on his upper body, and a Hakama (a sort of Japanese skirt) around his legs. His wave symbols are visible on part of his face, as well as on his clothing. He has an eyepatch over his right eye. Since he is modeled after a Samurai, he exclusively wields Katana type weapons.\nSanjuro tries his best to act the role of the wise and honorable warrior. And sees himself as a sort of wandering hero, traveling throughout The World protecting the weak. He has a great deal of hate for PKers, who he considers \"honorless dogs\". He is especially helpful to people visiting the JP servers from English speaking servers.\nThough he was still a bit of a newbie in his first appearance, his encounter with Kite and his assistance during the Twilight Incident made him into a very powerful player. He is likely one of the most powerful Heavy Blades in the game. He is close with most of the .hackers and a very good friend of Hotaru, who considers him as a mentor.",
