  "description" : "Dan helps his father run a spa resort hotel in the Isshu region located in between Kanoko Town and Sanyo City. A group of Meguroko were scaring off their customers at the sand bath and they had to close it down. The hot-sand spa was their hotel`s biggest attraction.\nWith the help of Ash and Iris, Dan and his father were able to figure out that the Meguroko were scaring off the customers to protect them from being scalded when the geysers went off. After the waters cooled a bit, Dan and his father opened up a hot spring just outside their hotel where their sand bath was. Iris gave it a five stars rating and had no complaints.",
