  "description" : "Alakazam loses the thick tail it once possessed as Kadabra (which might explain why it is 19 pounds lighter than Kadabra). It stands on two legs and always holds two silver spoons. Parts of Alakazam`s body are brown, but its predominant coloring is gold. Alakazam has a long, gold moustache - nonetheless, some Alakazam are female, though in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, females have dramatically smaller moustaches, while the males have longer ones.\nAlakazam are described as extremely intelligent. With an IQ of 5,000, they can outperform supercomputers and can memorize anything. Alakazam use their superior intelligence to immediately identify their opponents` weaknesses and gain the edge in battles. This intelligence and superb memory are said to come from the fact that Alakazam`s brain cells never stop multiplying - as a result, the overly large head must be supported by its telekinetic powers. In fact, Alakazam use their psychic abilities to watch all \"movement\", as their muscles are too weak. Also their senses are incredibly strong: just by closing its eyes it can heighten all the other senses dramatically. Alakazam evolves from Kadabra when you trade it to another Pokémon game.\nAlakazam is notable for having the highest Special Attack among non-legendary Pokémon, a statistic that affects the power of mental, fluid, and energy-based attacks, though it shares this title with another Pokémon, Porygon-Z. To balance its extremely high Special Attack, Alakazam`s other stats are atrocious, save for its high speed and average Special Defence, though this is offset by an awful HP stat. Alakazam made an appearance in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, as the leader of Team ACT.",
