  "description" : "Momota is a boy from http://anidb.net/ch142873 [Otogi Morihito]`s neighbourhood. Due to his haircut somewhat resembling a dorsal fin he was often made fun of and given the nickname Kasago カサゴ (a type of a rockfish). When they were kids he was badly hurt by Morihito who at the time didn`t know how to control his powers. Since then they were at odds with each other and Momota even tried to bully Morihito at times, who, quite ashamed of his reckless actions and not wanting to hurt Momota, was unable to retaliate. It is later implied that they eventually came to terms.",
