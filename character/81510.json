  "description" : "The Black King is the leader of the http://anidb.net/ch86430 [Ends]. He claims that he once tried to \"save\" humans, but he has since shifted his agenda towards non-humans after humans \"denied\" his efforts. His identity has yet to be established, but he is shown to possess healing powers and the ability to multiply any life form he wishes, infinitely producing food or wood. He also has puncture scars in both of his palms.\nHis ultimate goal is to eradicate all humans and create a new civilization of non-humans in a perpetual Dark Age, ensuring that they never advance far enough to become as destructive as humans, creating what the Black King believes will be a utopia. In order to achieve this, the Black King has instructed http://anidb.net/ch81071 [Rasputin] to create a simple alphabet and a syncretic religion to allow the different non-human races to find a common ground.\nSource: Wikipedia",
