  "description" : "Karui is a kunoichi of http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure], and a member of Team Samui. The team was sent to http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konoha] by the http://anidb.net/ch16171 [Fourth Raikage] to inform them that they would be taking care of http://anidb.net/ch7719 [Uchiha Sasuke] and http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki]. She, along with the other two members of her team, are http://anidb.net/ch13998 [Killer Bee]`s students.\nShe seems to have a somewhat comedic-negative relationship with her teammate, http://anidb.net/ch16825 [Omoi]. During their debut, they argued over the possible reasons that they could have been called by the Raikage. She assumed that he wanted them to get him more protein shakes. However, the argument started with Omoi implying that she is flat-chested in comparison to their teammate, Samui. However, like the rest of her team, she highly respects Killer Bee.\nShe is also quite outspoken and allows her emotions to let out, as she angrily yelled at Team Kakashi to allow the renegade Sasuke to run loose. She came to a violent point when she took out her rage on http://anidb.net/ch226 [Naruto] and beat him.",
