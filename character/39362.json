  "description" : "The mysterious transfer student that came to Misumaru Middle School wearing a 20th century school uniform, something rarely seen in the year 2070. He`s always calm and laid-back, but at the same time, he has secret powers that he rarely reveals. Little is known about Muryou; in fact, the more that`s revealed about him, the more enigmatic he becomes.
