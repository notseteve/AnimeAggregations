  "description" : "12th strongest Knight and the smallest of the Knights, Pinocchio was once a marionnette made by Diana for her little sister Dorothy when Dorothy was a child, and was apparently animated to life upon joining the Chess Pieces. In the 6th round, he was ordered to defeat Dorothy if he wished to become human. Like his namesake, his nose grows when he lies, but it transforms into a cannon after about three lies and can be used to shoot his opponents. In the War Games at the Mushroom Field, he is ripped apart by Dorothy`s ÄRM Toto, his remains salvaged by Chaton by the end of the 6th Round. In a filler episode, he was rebuilt with wagon wheels. Alongside Kouga and Girom, they ambushed Dorothy, Ginta and Alviss where Pinocchio destroyed Dorothy`s Andarta at the time when Babbo gets cracked. After being repelled, Diana then sent them to capture Caldia`s Grand Elder only to be defeated by Dorothy and Ginta. Also in the anime, they were last seen riding Kouga`s Kung Fu Frog somewhere. A Weapon ÄRM user.",
