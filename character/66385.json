Upon learning of the Emperor`s death during the Disith assault on the Anatoray capital, he orders his men to defend the capital with their own lives. His ambition drives him to defy a ceasefire order with Disith to the point that he is willing to kill heir apparent Princess Sophia in order to set \"the foundation of a reborn Anatoray\". He is killed when the Urbanus destroys the Scolopendra Cannon used to bombard the attacking Disith ships.\nHis name is based on the actual historical figure Vitellius, who led the Roman Empire for several months during the Year of the Four Emperors.",
