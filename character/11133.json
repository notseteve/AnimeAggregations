  "description" : "The huge Zeong, designed exclusively for Newtype pilots, is the first mobile suit equipped with a psycommu system. Thanks to this mind-machine interface, a Newtype pilot can use the Zeong`s detachable hands as remote-controlled gun turrets and attack his target from three directions at once. During the Battle of A Baoa Qu at the end of the war, Char Aznable takes the incomplete, legless Zeong into battle in a last attempt to defeat the Federation`s Gundam.",
