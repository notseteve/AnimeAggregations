  "description" : "Metang is formed from two Beldum merging to form a Metang. This merge is more than a physical one; both Beldums` brains in a Metang are linked by a network of magnetic impulses, making Metang quite intelligent. The Beldum only manifest as the arms and eyes of the Metang; some other material must make up the head. With both Beldums` magnetic fields combined, Metang`s abilities manifest as telekinesis. Its telekinetic power allows it to hover a short distance above the ground, as well as fly at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.\nMetang doesn`t rely entirely on its magnetic telekinesis, however, as it already has a portion of the durability and strength of Metagross. Its metal carapace is tough enough to survive even cataclysmic explosions and can leave a collision from a jet plane without a scratch. Metang`s claws can rip through tempered steel.",
