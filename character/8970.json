  "description" : "Alphard is an attractive young woman who is both the leader of a terrorist organization called Snake, which is responsible for both the Shibuya and Shanghai terrorists attacks, and http://anidb.net/ch8969 [Canaan]`s arch-enemy. Herself once http://anidb.net/ch10772 [Siam]`s apprentice and known as Canaan, she has since thrown away that identity and adopted her current name. Once, Alphard, Siam and Canaan were hired to hijack an armored military train containing the Ua virus. During the assignment, Alphard betrayed her teammates when it was revealed their client ordered her to kill all witnesses, including them. She shot Siam and left him to die while escaping with the virus. She appears easily capable of taking down Canaan even though the latter uses her synesthesia, reasoning that, unlike Canaan, she is no longer manipulated by feelings.\nSource: Wikipedia",
