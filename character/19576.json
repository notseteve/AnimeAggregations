  "description" : "Michel Volban de Cabelle is the figurehead of the People`s Army. She is actually the sister of the real Michel Volban who has disappeared in the war with Vetti. She had her own back scarred with a X-shaped mark in order to imitate her brother`s scar which was flashbacked after being revealed as a woman to Cleo`s crew. Michel`s personality is evident because of her past. She had little contact with her mother who died only months after she was born and her father being home rarely. She learned to fight from her brother, who had become a major role model in her life. She loved fencing and wished to be like her brother, which may explain her tom-boyish attitude. After her father had seen her fencing with her brother, and seeing that she surpassed him, she was ordered to be more like a lady of a royal house. After that incident, she vowed to herself that she would become a proper lady. But, after her father`s death, and her brother`s death during the major battle in the beginning of the series, she renounces her identity and becomes her brother in order to save the People`s Army from destruction.",
