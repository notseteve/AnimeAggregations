  "description" : "Vingt-Sept is a somewhat gangly-looking machine sporting outstretched wings which can be used as a secondary pair of arms at its shoulders that house a multitude of speaker-like openings on its surface, which likely help magnify the range and effect of the reality-bending Exotic Maneuvers Nicola uses. It has the ability to create reality distortions which it can use to manipulate objects around it and use them as offensive weapons, other than that it has two swords for slicing through the enemy. Designed primarily for quick movement and melee combat, Vingt-Sept is light on ranged attacks, relying instead on remote-detonated \"mines\", as evidenced in the battle against the Jupiter Express. Its name means \"twenty-seven\" in French.",
