  "description" : "Not much is known about Ciel`s father. He was the head of the Phantomhive family and handsome enough to attract the attention of both Rachel and her sister Angelina, though he favored the older, more refined sister. It`s because of his compliments on her red hair that Angelina originally began wearing red. Though he appears in several flashbacks, his face is never shown. He and Rachel were killed on Ciel`s tenth birthday.",
