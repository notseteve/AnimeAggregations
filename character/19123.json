  "description" : "Ryuuna acknowledged Zero`s intentions, a priestess of Etwarl Shrine who believes in Souma. Zeroboros lived inside her, so in order to stop him, she committed suicide by throwing herself into Xion`s sword. She was later resurrected by Zero, along with Lazarus. Souma is able to pull a broadsword type soul blade from her called Holy Dragon Sword Heavenly Cloud Bush (聖龍剣 アマノムラクモ, Seiryuuken Amanomurakumo); it has the power to paralyze its enemies with a blinding light.\nSource: Wikipedia",
