  "description" : "A small blue mammalian called a cheagle. He joins Luke`s group when the elder cheagle exiles him for setting fire to the forest where ligers live, which causes the ligers to hunt the cheagles for food. Cheagles are considered sacred by the Order of Lorelei due to a pact formed with Yulia Jue, symbolised by the Sorcerer`s Ring. The ring enables cheagles to communicate with others, as well as use the power of various fonons to gain new skills.",
