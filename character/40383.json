  "description" : "Iris and Christie came Mimi`s house to inform her that her Tabunne might be in trouble as other Tabunne in the area had been disappearing. They put a tag on Tabunne to track it in case it disappeared. Sure enough, like the other Tabunne, it was susceptible to Team Rocket`s device and against its will it started walking towards their hideout. Thanks to the help of Cilan and Officer Jenny (Isshu), they were able to stop Team Rocket and Tabunne was returned to Mimi.",
