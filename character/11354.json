  "description" : "Weda is Haré`s mother. She is carefree and inclined to binge drinking. Because of her laziness, Haré looks after her and does most of the \"housewifely\" things. She left life in a rich home at the age of 14 when her father disowned her for becoming pregnant and refusing to divulge the father`s name (out of fear that her father would destroy Clive`s life). She raised Hare in the jungle by herself which, due to her chronic irresponsibility, is quite difficult to fathom. She may have survived on the fact that she`s a brilliant hunter, second only to the Elder.",
