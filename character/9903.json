  "description" : "Luke Ainsworth, the titular character, is a blacksmith of great skill and renown and is also a talented swordsman. Possessing dark brown hair and blue eyes, he is arrogant, private and often insensitive to others. He lives with Lisa, who aids him in his work and often accompanies him on his business. He comes to know Cecily after saving her repeatedly from certain death. Luke wields a Japanese katana and employs a unique sword-fighting style, which is uncommon in a land where most people use a longsword and shield. He also possesses extraordinary blacksmith skills, as well as the magical ability to forge a katana in the midst of a battle.\nWhen Cecily sees his katana cut a sword in two, the same sword that shattered her own, she desires one of her own and persistently asks him to forge one for her. While he often comments on her pride and hotheaded personality and her large breasts, he comes to like and admire Cecily. Her will to protect the city and everyone within it reminds him of Lisa Oakwood, the love of his youth who was slain before his eyes by Valbanil.",
