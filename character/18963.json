  "description" : "Orikakan is the lord of Kucca Kecca, a small country renowned for the skill and zeal of its cavalry, and is an excellent tactician.\nOrikakan is obsessed with gaining revenge against Hakuoro, believing him to be \"Rak Shine\", a traitor to Kuccha Keccha, who murdered his wife, children, and hundreds of other people. The murdered wife was Orikakan`s sister, whose death is the primary reason for his zeal in pursuing revenge. He seeks to attain his revenge by attacking Tusukuru. He personally leads the attack on Yamayura, slaying all the inhabitants and prompting Hakuoro to declare war on Kuccha Keccha. While initially Hakuoro believes he might indeed be \"Rak Shine\" (since Hakuoro lost all of his memories and cannot remember who he was, traitor or not, before Eruruu found him injured in the woods), Orikakan turns out to be mistaken, manipulated by another agency into falsely believing that Hakuoro was \"Rak Shine.\" He was eventually killed by Niwe when his purpose was fulfilled, before Hakuoro is able to hear all he has to say.",
