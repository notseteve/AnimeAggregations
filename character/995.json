  "description" : "Trapinch is found in the desert. Its nest is a sloped, bowl-like pit dug in sand. It patiently waits for prey to tumble down the pit, where it attacks with its jaws with the strength to crush even boulders. It can wait for long periods of time, as it can go without water for a week. It has a large heavy head, that makes it hard to get up if it falls on its back.\nTrapinch`s main weapon is its jaws, which can crush boulders. Trapinch are also known for their digging skills. In addition, Trapinch has an ability known as Arena Trap, preventing the escape of Pok√©mon and Trainer alike.",
