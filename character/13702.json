  "description" : "Geacht`er is the leader and founder of G Society whose goal is to dismantle the GTO. He projects a message to Aineias claiming that the GTO are corrupt and that his G Society will bring peace to the galaxy. His ability is to plant deadly roses onto targets. These roses are white before turning red while the victim is dying. After the death, the rose then turns black. Many of the G Society believe he is not who he claims to be, but are too scared to voice their thoughts aloud. He seems to have an interest in Ascoeur. It is later revealed he was the one who caused the incident 25 years ago, trying to destroy the universe and since then has created the G Society. It is currently unknown if he is trying to attempt to destroy the universe again, and is only using the Nouvelesse`s hope to regain their title for his own gain. In episode 15, Geacht`er reveals to Ascoeur that she is his sister Liselotte and that his real name is Alfred, given that they share the same rose birthmark.",
