  "description" : "Young Emiya Kiritsugu as seen in a flashback during the second season of Fate/Zero.\nHe lives with his father http://anidb.net/ch38668 [Emiya Noritaka] in a rather desolate area of a place called Alimango Island. The actual location of Alimango Island is never mentioned, but, as \"alimango\" is the Tagalog word for a kind of crab, the island is assumed to be part of the Philippine Archipelago or surrounding areas. At first the locals were distrustful of Kiritsugu and Noritaka, but after a while, although the rarely seen Noritaka continued to be a source of wariness, Kiritsugu started to get along with islanders, specially http://anidb.net/ch44390 [Shirley]. As the locals have difficulty pronouncing his name, they nicknamed him Kerry.",
