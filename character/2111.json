  "description" : "Outgoing and usually the instigator of the pack, she is identifiable by the fact that she does not wear a blazer over her shirt and tie like most other characters. She`s a typical trouble-maker, who likes to achieve her objectives in a straight-forward and intuitive manner and doesn`t really seem to mind other people`s circumstances. Because she was absent during the first few days of school, she was unwittingly assigned as a member of the discipline committee. She has an older brother Kitsune, whom she apparently holds in very low regard, and an older sister Oniyuri. She`s Suzume`s childhood friend. Despite her tendency to skip classes, she still receives above average grades in tests as she is actually quite intelligent. Her name contains a kanji of tiger (虎, tora) and the first kanji letter of her name (上) can be pronounced as `Ue` (West), thus revealing her name`s relationship with White Tiger of the West (白虎).",
