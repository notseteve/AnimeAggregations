  "description" : "9-year-old prodigy Negi Springfield has a bachelor`s degree and magical powers, but he`s sadly unprepared for his newest challenge! teaching English to a class full of teenage girls! A soft-spoken and kind lad, Negi wants to do well in his new position and he just might if he can quit crossing hot-headed rabble-rouser Asuna. He`s still got some kinks to work out in his spell casting and his lesson plan, but Negi`s a good kid with a great heart. Most of the girls instantly take to him, though he may need to keep some distance. And if any of the students find out about his wizardly training, he`ll be transformed into a furry ermine!",
