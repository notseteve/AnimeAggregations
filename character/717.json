  "description" : "Mitsukuni Haninozuka, usually called Honey, is a third-year at Ouran High School depicted as a very childish and cake-loving boy who is much older than his elementary school appearance would indicate. In the anime, there is a scene which shows the true strength and power Honey possesses and it is said that he has been told by Japan`s Defence Minister not to show his full power for fear of other countries thinking Japan held a weapon of mass destruction, causing the other countries to fire missiles at Japan (see episode 18 in the anime). Hunny is often around his cousin, Mori, who is very close to him. Honey lives with his father, the owner of a famous dojo and his little brother, Yasuchika, with whom he is often at odds. Hunny is very fond of eating sweets and his room is full of stuffed animals. He always carries around a plush bunny named Bun-Bun. He used to hide his true self (with much difficulty) by being a \"real man\" for some time, but after Tamaki convinced him that liking cute things wasn`t bad, he soon realised that there was absolutely no need for him to do that. Then, together with Mori, he joined the host club, attracting customers with his shotacon cuteness.",
