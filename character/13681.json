  "description" : "Neko-gami-sama (Lord Cat) is a cat-like creature that often stays inside vending machines to warm the drinks to \"body temperature\". He sometimes uses mysterious powers to play tricks on Mesousa, such as dropping him into a hole appearing out of nowhere. He almost always ends his sentences with the phrase \"-desu nya\".\nIn each episode Lord Cat is shown with his fur and eyes a different color. Lord Cat has a younger brother that looks nearly identical to him who appears once late in the anime.",
