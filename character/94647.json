  "description" : "Ginoza Nobuchika is an Enforcer with http://anidb.net/ch76608 [Public Safety Division 1] at the http://anidb.net/ch76607 [Public Safety Bureau].\nHe was demoted to Enforcer after his Crime Coefficient rose above regulation levels to 140, after the death of his father http://anidb.net/ch48543 [Masaoka Tomomi] at the hands of http://anidb.net/ch48756 [Makishima Shougo]. As part of the incident, Ginoza lost his left arm and gained a prosthetic, much like his father. Ginoza`s personality and outlook on life also drastically changed. Further, he no longer wears glasses; when http://anidb.net/ch48307 [Tsunemori Akane] asks if he actually needed prescription glasses, Ginoza replied that he wore glasses as he did not like the shape of his face, but he no longer cares about this aspect of his appearance.",
