  "description" : "Rockruff is a Rock-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Lycanroc. The form it evolves into depends on the game it evolves in.\n- In Pokémon Sun, Rockruff evolves into Midday Form Lycanroc when leveled up in the day starting at level 25.\n- In Pokémon Moon, Rockruff evolves into Midnight Form Lycanroc when leveled up at night starting at level 25.\nRockruff is a quadruped, canine Pokémon. It is primarily light brown with a darker brown muzzle, paws, and ear tips. It has large blue eyes, button ears, a short muzzle with a triangular pink nose, and a short tuft of fur on each cheek. Around its neck is a ruff of grayish-white fur stubbed with dark brown pebbles. The dark brown markings on its paws extend to a thin point on each wrist and ankle. It has a grayish-white tail that curls tightly over its back and is covered in fluffy fur.\nRockruff has an excellent sense of smell. It will never forget an odor after smelling it once. There are tales of it reuniting with its Trainer after becoming lost by following the faintest traces of scent. This Pokémon is very sociable and will greet others by rubbing them with the rocks around its neck. As it ages, Rockruff becomes wilder. Once it is close to evolving, it will begin to howl when the sun goes down. It has been said to leave its Trainer`s side and return once it has evolved. A persistent Pokémon, it will keep going until it outlasts foes that are even more powerful.",
