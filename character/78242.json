  "description" : "Sakagami Chiya is http://anidb.net/ch78244 [Yuzuka]`s friend who deems Yuzuka \"the most important friend\" and truly cares about her: for example, she is on guard against http://anidb.net/ch78241 [Miton] for the good of Yuzuka. She is usually emotionless and speaks in monotone voice. She can see and hear Miton, and has the aptitude of a magical girl; however, the limitation in Miton`s capacity prevents her from really becoming one. She is fascinated by Yuzuka`s status and figure as magical girl.\nSource: Wikipedia",
