Glen used Thane`s Father`s Patrat to battle against Thane`s Father`s Blitzle who was commanded by Thane. The initial battle when on for quite awhile and both Thane`s Father`s Patrat and Thane`s Father`s Blitzle got exhausted from the battling and were finally both recalled by Thane as they are precious to his father and he didn`t want them to be injured.\nNone of Thane`s Father`s Blitzle moves are known as Thane`s only command was for it to dodge Thane`s Father`s Patrat`s Tackle attack.",
