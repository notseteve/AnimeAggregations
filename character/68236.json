  "description" : "Shima Juuzou is the second son of the Shima family. As the second son, he has more responsibilities than his younger brothers. He is also an Upper Second Class Exorcist.\nJuuzou is first introduced while fighting http://anidb.net/ch85283 [Houjou Mamushi] over their families, and although at first he is advising his younger brother http://anidb.net/ch68237 [Kinzou] not to get into a fight with her, he subsequently gets quite worked up about it, resulting in a physical confrontation. However, he seems to be more level headed and responsible than Kinzou, and less laid back than http://anidb.net/ch25818 [Renzou].\nHe is serious when it comes to his duties, and has showed concern about his childhood friend Mamushi, as well as taking care of his father. He has a lighthearted side and gets on well with his two youngest brothers.\nSource: Ao no Exorcist Wiki, edited.",
