  "description" : "One of the Oniwabanshuu members, Shikijou (式尉) is a muscle-laden hand-to-hand fighter. Prior to joining the Oniwabanshuu, Shikijou was an onmitsu for the Satsuma faction of the Ishin Shishi. In the second year of Keiou (1866) Shikijou infiltrated Edo Castle so he could get information about an upcoming battle. 13-year old Shinomori Aoshi appeared, created scars all over Shikijou`s body, and defeated Shikijou. Aoshi gave Shikijou a chance to join the Oniwabanshuu and gain strength using Oniwabanshuu training methods and \"medicines.\" Shikijou received no prosperous government job offers because he was a traitor. Shikijou is mainly a hand to hand fighter but he also swings around a large ball and chain. He fights Sagara Sanosuke at Takeda Kanryuu`s mansion and is (barely) defeated.\nHe is the first to die at Kanryuu`s hand, protecting Aoshi from the gatling gun.",
