  "description" : "Groudon is one of a trio of legendary Pokémon, alongside Kyogre and Rayquaza, that represents Pokémon Ruby and appears on its cover art. In the legend surrounding the three, Groudon represents the land, while Kyogre and Rayquaza represent the sea and the sky, respectively. Groudon, representing land, raised lands and expanded continents in legend. Coming as a savior for humans suffering from floods caused by Kyogre, it can dissipate clouds, and evaporate water with light and heat. After a titanic battle with Kyogre, it went to sleep in underground magma, causing volcanoes to erupt when it awakes. It is a Ground-type with the Drought ability, which makes the weather sunny until another weather move is used or a Pokémon with another weather-altering ability is switched in.\nGroudon first appears in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald along with Kyogre and Rayquaza. Pokémon Ruby focuses on Team Magma awakening Groudon to take over the world, while Pokémon Emerald has both Groudon and Kyogre awake. The anime follows a similar structure, where both Pokémon are awakened, and forced to battle by Team Magma and Team Aqua. This is foiled by Ash Ketchum and Lance, and Groudon and Kyogre return to their respective elements after calling a truce. Groudon also plays a pseudo-role in the sixth Pokémon movie, Jirachi Wishmaker, where an evil being in the form of a Groudon is formed from the energy of Jirachi.",
