  "description" : "Nakagami Shin`ichirou is a male high school student who enjoys drawing, and even starts working on a picture book. He lives with his mother, father, and childhood friend Yuasa Hiromi. She used to smile around him, though does not anymore when at home. Shin`ichirou longs to see her smile again which he loved so much as a kid. He is living a relatively normal life until he meets a strange girl named Isurugi Noe who curses him with misfortune after he teases her a bit, though he reconciles with her soon after. Shin`ichirou is frustrated by not being able to see emotion from Hiromi, and other pressures from his family, such as a traditional Japanese dance he does not want to practice.\nHowever, he eventually gives in to practising hard for the dance due to comments made by Noe. Shin`ichirou receives much confidence from Noe, and even goes out with her for a short time, but in the end he and Hiromi start a relationship.",
