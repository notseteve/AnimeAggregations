  "description" : "Commander of the Varauta Army. Uncouth and rebellious, he frequently vexes http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti] by violating orders and launching all-out spiritia raids on the Macross 7 fleet. Indeed, it emerges that his real aim—other than to preserve the joy of the hunt over the Spiritia Farm Project—is to gather enough spiritia to reawaken not himself or http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti], but another Protodeviln named http://anidb.net/ch43707 [Sivil], with whom he is in love. This earns the anger of the other Protodeviln, who attempt to destroy him, but when he discovers the power of singing from http://anidb.net/ch49391 [Fire Bomber]`s lead singer http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara], he begins to generate his own spiritia and reawakens in his earlier form, a giant humanoid creature with no human facial features. Such is the intensity of his desire to protect http://anidb.net/ch43707 [Sivil] that he generates an enormously powerful energy field which destroys the planet Lux and, to the horror of everyone, himself.Source: wiki",
