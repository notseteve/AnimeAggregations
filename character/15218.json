  "description" : "Kan`u is known as the Beautiful Black-haired bandit fighter and wields the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. She is also one of the main characters beside Chouhi. Her past reveals that her family was killed by bandits, which made it her quest to ensure Innocent people will never suffer like she did. She cares a lot for her friends, and she is a sister to Chouhi after they swore a vow of sisterhood because she felt sorry for Chouhi`s loneliness. Two common recurring jokes about her are: 1) people who have heard the legend of the Black-haired bandit fighter remark that the rumors describe her as the a most beautiful woman, and because of this did not think Kan`u was her and 2) some of the female characters mistakenly believe she and Rinrin are mother and daughter despite the fact she is still young. The second running gag is carried even further in Shin Koihime Musou when Kousonsan mistakes Koumei as Kan`u`s daughter as well.",
