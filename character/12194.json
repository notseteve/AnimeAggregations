  "description" : "A two-headed dragon demon and Sesshomaru`s beast of burden. He is one of two youkai in the series who is explicitly stated to be an herbivore. Despite travelling with Sesshomaru for centuries, he has no name until Rin gives him one, calling the right head \"A\" and the left head \"Un\". A-Un can fire youkai energy from both mouths. The right head shoots blue beams of lightning, while the left shoots green lightning that can control clouds and possibly the weather. A grey cloud-like gas trails from his legs in flight, similar to Kirara`s flames.",
