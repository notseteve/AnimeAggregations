Hagatha and Nagatha are identical but they wear different coloured headbands.\nHagatha will rent the Hoothoot and her sister, Nagatha, will collect them once the customer has passed through the forest by using Foresight.\nOne of the Hoothoot owned by Hagatha is inexperienced and has never successfully guided a person through the haunted forest. In addition, this Hoothoot feels most confortable around pretty girls.",
