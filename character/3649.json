  "description" : "Ichiko is, in fact, a ghost. Her story begins 22 years ago: a previous Elder (actually Mizuho`s mother) had a close relationship with an underclassmen who had a weak body. When that underclassman was in hospital, she could not wait to see the Elder. The underclassman got away from the hospital, went to the Elder`s room, and waited, but she passed away before she had the chance to talk with the Elder. That room has been deemed the \"closed room\" ever since, until Mizuho arrived and started living it, according to his grandfather`s will.",
