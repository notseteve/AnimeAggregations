  "description" : "Menthuthuyoupi (モントゥトゥユピー), also known as \"Youpi\" (ユピー), is the third of the Chimera Ant Royal Guards. Youpi is the largest of the three and the only non-human hybrid among them, mixed with the genes of a magical beast instead. He is the most straightforward of the Royal Guards and possesses a strength that comes from complete selflessness and devotion to the King. Youpi`s body can metamorphosize, such as forming wings to fly or additional arms for combat. After feeling extreme mental stress, he learns his Nen ability can billow large quantities of his aura into his body and release it in a destructive explosion. Through his fights with the Hunters, Youpi comes to respect them and Nen to the point of letting them live.\nSource: Wikipedia",
