  "description" : "Yushirou is a demon created by http://anidb.net/ch104023 [Tamayo]. He cares for her greatly and is very protective of her. It has been implied that he loves her. He is the only demon made by Tamayo and as such, has no connection to http://anidb.net/ch104020 [Muzan]. He only needs a small amount of blood to survive, even less than Tamayo. He is mentioned to have a \"battle form\" which he can change into. He has a special power which can erase the presence of living things as well as make the unseen seen. This technique is not perfect and the more people he attempts to hide, the easier it is to find them.\nSource: Wikipedia",
