  "description" : "A piece of Gunpla which http://anidb.net/ch132325 [Rio] built using Entry Grade http://anidb.net/ch10986 [RX-78-2] as its base. It was customized according to the \"Japanese spirit\" as understood by the boy who grew up in the Aloha State, and \"Lah\" in its name means \"the sun\" in Hawaiian. Even though he was a first-timer, the machine was meticulously finished through repeated trial and error, and Rio`s sunny admiration toward Gunpla Battle was incorporated in it.\nSource: Official page",
