  "description" : "Gaku is one of Naota`s classmates and close friends and is obsessed with kissing and other things of sexual behaviour. In episode three, \"Marquis de Carabas,\" he plays the part of a mouse in the school play. Gaku also uses the word \"chu\" constantly, especially when referring to Haruko. This is a pun in Japanese, because \"chu\" is the Japanese onomatopoeia for both kissing and the sound a mouse makes. He`s somewhat hyper and is usually seen with Masashi. He is an encyclopedia of bizarre rumors and legends, many of which are sexual in nature. He consistently refers to Mamimi as Naota`s \"wife\".",
