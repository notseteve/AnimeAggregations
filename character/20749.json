  "description" : "A powerful, nine-tailed kitsune, who resides in the Sen-Kai. In the anime, she and Meirin may simply be alternative versions of one another; she described Meirin as her \"other self\", which in context may mean that Meirin is her creation or an independent creature which fissioned off from Tamamonomae.\nDespite her sexual and alcoholic tendencies, is not an unsympathetic character; she has considerable insight into people and does some fairly altruistic things for some of the other characters; she restores Marieru to human form, helps Garuganchua to acknowledge the truth, returns the Hat to Eve and finally seems to have taken Garuganchua`s henchmen in as permanent guests.",
