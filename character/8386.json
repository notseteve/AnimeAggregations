  "description" : "Father of the Nohara family from Akita in Northern Japan, and its sole source of income. He met Misae at the age of 29, and after dating for around a year the two wed. He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family bread-winner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. At age 35, he is a stereotypical salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, and enjoying the occasional nightlife. While his relationship with his family is positive on the whole, there is an abundance of recurring conflict. He and his wife bicker on many different things, from how little he gets for spending money every month, to whose turn it is to give the baby a bath. Misae is also notorious for inflicting violence on Hiroshi whenever she gets very angry. He enjoys a playful relationship with his children; but sometimes they`re the source of his daily woes. He will not hesitate to save his allowance for things he wants, but can be seen spending much of it to buy his family creature comforts. A running joke is made of the pungent odor of his feet.",
