  "description" : "After the destruction of the http://anidb.net/ch82028 [Beryoska], http://anidb.net/ch269 [Boris Konev] was left without a ship. In the confusion of the events following the Battle of Vermilion, http://anidb.net/ch745 [Alex Cazellnu] arranged for a brand-new Alliance vessel to be listed as decommissioned, while actually being given to Boris. Christened the \"Undutiness\" at http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang]`s suggestion, this was the vessel used by http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian] on his trip to Earth -- the name being Yang`s joke, as Julian was effectively neglecting his duties towards his \"parent\".\nThe same vessel was used by Boris to bring information to http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn] about the plot on Yang`s life, and the news of http://anidb.net/ch194 [Reuenthal]`s rebellion",
