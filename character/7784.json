  "description" : "Trisha Elric is the deceased mother of http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric]. Her husband http://anidb.net/ch7783 [Van Hohenheim] leaves her and their two sons behind to find a way to escape his immortality and achieve this goal. Trisha tries to last until his return, though she ultimately dies of an illness. http://anidb.net/ch42761 [Ed] and http://anidb.net/ch42762 [Al] attempt to revive her with human transmutation, but instead create a malformed entity that dies within moments of being created. Hohenheim would later plant the suggestion that the creature was not the actual Trisha, leading to the conclusion it was Alphonse possessing an artificially created body momentarily after losing his own. In the first anime series, the failed creation becomes the homunculus http://anidb.net/ch19254 [Sloth].\nSource: Wikipedia",
