  "description" : "Sakura Kyouko is a rival Puella Magi who comes to the city after Mami is killed by a witch. A girl with red-colored long hair and an equally fiery personality to match. Amusingly, she is always seen eating something, even while she is battling Sayaka. When Kyouko learns Sayaka had become a Puella Magi just before she arrived, she becomes Sayaka`s enemy for allegedly stealing her territory, although she later tries to help her after learning the truth about Soul Gems. She comes from a poor church family and used her wish so that people would listen to her father`s preachings. However, when her father learned of this, he went mad and killed his entire family. As such, Kyouko decided only to use her magic for herself, since using it for others will only cause despair. Having grown up in a poor family, she often has to steal food and hates wasting it, a logic she also applies to Grief Seeds, as she only goes after fully grown witches. Kyouko wields a spear which can extend itself, split into multiple sections, and produce a ball at the end of the chain, which can constrict and hit others at the same time.",
