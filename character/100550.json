  "description" : "Srajo \"The Obscure\", is a legendary White Whistle delver of The Abyss. Since he`s a White Whistle, he`s presumed to have made amazing discoveries within the pit and retrieved artifacts that have changed the world. Like most White Whistles, he settled on the 5th Layer and lived there for some time, since it is the last point of the abyss where it is possible to return alive.\nHe`s also known as the \"Lord of Mystery\", and true to his epithet, is the White Whistle with the least amount of information known.\nSource: Made in Abyss Wiki",
