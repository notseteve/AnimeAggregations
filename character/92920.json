  "description" : "A reserved-yet-clever catgirl of few words who absolutely loves Chocola.\nAlongside her twin, Chocola, they both share the title of youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. Vanilla is prone to being misunderstood when she says too little, but she has remarkable insight and is quite sharp. Her sharp wit and I`ll-do-things-my-way attitude make her Chocola`s complete opposite. However, she remains at once both kind-hearted and, well, catlike.\nShe loves Chocola both as a sister and in a romantic manner, and sees Kashou as a love rival.\nChocola and Vanilla were found as strays on the side of the road by the Minadukis. A few days after being adopted, they became ill due to refusing to eat, but recovered after being taken to a clinic.",
