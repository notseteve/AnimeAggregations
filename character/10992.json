  "description" : "This tiny aerospace fighter doubles as a cockpit for the Earth Federation`s Gundam, Guncannon, and Guntank mobile suits. Thanks to the Core Block system used in these prototype mobile suits, the cockpit module can eject and unfold into a fighter plane, allowing the pilot and vital test data to escape to safety. While it`s armed with four vulcan guns and a pair of missile launchers, only a truly reckless pilot would deliberately take a Core Fighter into battle.",
