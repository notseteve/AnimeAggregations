  "description" : "One of the last evolutions of the old Principality of Zeon`s MS-09 Dom series, the MS-09G Dwadge (not to be confused with the MS-10 Pezun Dowadge of Zeon`s \"Pezun Project\") continues to be used for many years after the One Year War. By the time of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, the Dwadge is operated by several parties, including the new Neo Zeon military, old African-based Zeon remnants from the One Year War, and the civilian African Liberation Front. Although quite similar to its predecessor, the Dwadge is an improvement over the well-proven and successful Dom in that it also mounts four vulcan guns in the head and carries an external propellant tank on its backpack, thus extending the operational time for using the Dwadge`s ground-skimming hovering jets. The Dwadge remains in use with Zeon remnants as late as U.C. 0096 during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base.\nSource: mahq.net",
