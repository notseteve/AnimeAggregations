  "description" : "The 41st President of the United States, referred to as \"Papa Bush\". In his mind, he was disgraced by the Japanese twice: the first is when he was being shot down above Ogasawara in World War II, the second is when his son was defeated in Okinawa on the mahjong table. He summoned Koizumi to the Texas Schoolbook Depository in Dallas (by kidnapping Taizou) in order to settle the score with mahjong. His special move is the \"Apocalypse Now Ron\" (where \"ron\" is winning by picking a discard).",
