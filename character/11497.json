  "description" : "Kusano (Sekirei #108), commonly referred to as \"Ku-chan\" or \"Ku\", is the youngest of Minato`s Sekirei. She is also known as the \"Green Girl\" (Midori no Shoujo) by other Sekirei.\nKusano refers to Minato as \"onii-chan\" (big brother), and is the most attached to him. She does not like fighting or quarrelling and she can be seen stopping them when they start. She is very impressionable and often copies Musubi and Tsukiumi`s mannerisms. She has expressed a desire to be Minato`s wife when she grows up.\nKusano has the power to control plants, making them grow at an accelerated rate and to unnaturally large proportions, and typically uses them to ensnare or disable her opponents without hurting them. Her name literally means \"A Grass Field\". Her MBI adjustments were never completed, which is why when she`s sad or upset, her powers rage out of control.",
