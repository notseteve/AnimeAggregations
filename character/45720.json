Elchi is obsessed with culture and often has aspirations of abandoning the Iron Gear as a result, but continuously returns to it. She angers easily and is often in conflict with many members of the Iron Gear crew. In the second half of the series she is captured by the Innocent and brainwashed into desiring the destruction of the Iron Gear and the death of Jiron. She is given the Iron Gear-like landship Gear Gear, and later another landship which she calls the Carrying. She launches multiple attacks on the Iron Gear with these ships. She is often in conflict with her subordinates.\n\nAs the series draws to a close Elchi is captured by Jiron and the others. They are able to remove her brainwashing by shifting her new personality to Arthur Rank, and Elchi returns to her normal self. During the final battle she fights against Kashim and Viram but is blinded by an explosion.\n",
