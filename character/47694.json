  "description" : "Touko is Robin`s roommate, and also Zaizen`s daughter. She takes care of Robin until the raid at STN-J, and expresses interest in Robin by asking her several questions. She appears to have had a relationship with Amon, but he eventually decides to end it. In the middle of the series, a group of assassins tie her up, duct tape her mouth shut, and use her as bait during an assassination attempt on Robin in her apartment. During the ensuing gun battle, she is shot in the back and critically injured. Others tell Robin that Touko`s \"physically recovered but the rest is mental\", suggesting that Touko is having difficulty accepting what happened.\nSource: Wiki",
