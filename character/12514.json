  "description" : "Inouva is an anime-and-game-only character sporting an elven appearance and manner.\nHe was a devoted servant of Zagato`s--in fact, a birthday present from Emeraude to her High Priest.\nInouva is not humanoid as he appears, but an animal-shaped elemental of lightning who assumed a human form to better serve his new master. His true form resembles a giant dog with two tendrils streaming from its head.\nHis weak spot proved to be the gemstone embedded in his forehead in either form.\nHe first challenged the Magic Knights in the Sky Shrine, and would have defeated them if not for Windam`s revival. He later resumed his true form, and was destroyed by Hikaru.",
