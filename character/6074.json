  "description" : "Iria hails from the Batabitajira region of the planet Myce and is employed by Ghomvak Security & Investigations, a bounty hunting agency. She`s somewhat of a tomboy and is considered eccentric for her habit of wearing men`s hair ornaments. Her hunter ID number is 9799-5. A hunter`s rank is identified by the colour of a stone pendant which resembles a magatama. Iria`s pendant as an apprentice is pink with two small dots on it, but when she receives her full license and ID number she is given a blue stone with three red dots on it. Although she is just a rookie at first and a bit reckless, Iria makes up for it with natural ability and a sharp mind.",
