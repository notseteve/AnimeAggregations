  "description" : "Koharu`s Gothita is a very selfish Pokémon who took a liking to Ash`s Scraggy. Koharu and Koharu`s Gothita form a combo and are now visiting gyms in the Unova region. Koharu`s Gothita realizes that it can get its way whenever it wants by just playing Koharu and she quickly relents and agrees to whatever it wants.\nWhen Koharu`s Gothita decided that it liked Ash`s Scraggy, Koharu`s Gothita instructed Koharu to send out all her Pokémon so Ash could decide which one of her Pokémon he`d trade with. When Ash said he wasn`t willing to trade, Koharu`s Gothita got upset and in order to please it, Koharu`s attitude changed as she tried to persuade Ash by playing to his vanity. After numerous suggestions that Ash was a weak opponent, Ash agreed to battle against Koharu and if he lost he would trade his Zuruggu. Koharu lost the battle though and Ash`s Scraggy wasn`t traded to her but Koharu`s Gothita got really mad at her for losing.\nKoharu`s Gothita convinced Ash`s Scraggy to come with it outside to get something to eat. They ended up getting in trouble with a Garbodor and Koharu`s Deerling to use its Aromatherapy to calm down the raging Garbodor after Ash`s Snivy had followed them to see what they were up to. Koharu`s Gothita did not like the fact that Ash`s Snivy had been looking up on them and it decided it wanted to battle it.\nBattle against Ash`s Snivy\nKoharu`s Gothita was quite mad at Ash`s Snivy but it didn`t stand a chance against it in battle. Ash`s Snivy barely broke a sweat as it was able to counter and avoid all of Koharu`s Gothita`s attacks before it knocked it out with its Leaf Storm. Still upset, Koharu`s Gothita ran off into the distance.",
