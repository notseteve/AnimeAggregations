  "description" : "Timcanpy is a modified golem that is passed down to http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen Walker] from General http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian]. It follows Allen (or http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee] when Allen is not with him) around, and can often be found resting on Allen`s head or shoulders. He has the ability to record the events that occur around him and then play them back, and is able to rebuild himself when he is crushed or destroyed.\nIt is revealed later that Timcanpy also contains the piano score for the http://anidb.net/ch84636 [14th], and has been owned by http://anidb.net/ch84602 [Nea Walker].\nUnlike most other golems, which are mechanical, Timcanpy seems to be a biological being, though what his body is made up of is unclear as he has been seen being reduced to fragments with no discernible organs. He also has a mouth, teeth and tongue. Its size also differs.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
