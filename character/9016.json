  "description" : "Gotou is the Captain of Unit 2 and was born in the Taito Ward in Tokyo. Although he may seem very laidback and even apathetic, he`s quite a strategist, and knows how to get the best out of his team even if it means tricking them. He has gained the reputation of being very sharp and rumour has it he was purposely sent out to the SV2 so he wouldn`t cause any trouble, which he still manages to do so anyway. Gotou is a heavy smoker, has athlete`s foot and can often be seen wearing traditional Japanese wooden sandals around the office. Character designer Takada Akemi based Gotou`s appearance on Japanese actor Nakagai Tatsuya`s physical appearance in the Kurosawa Akira film \"High and Low\".",
