  "description" : "Volcarona is a large moth-like Pokémon, that is heavily inspired in appearance by Hathor and an Atlas Moth. In the Pokédex entry, a mythological account tells of a volcano`s ash darkening the sun, and Volcarona`s flames providing a replacement of light. Other facts such as its title as \"Sun Pokémon\", and the fact it dwells in-game within an abandoned sun temple in a desert, imply it is a solar deity akin to the Egyptian sun god Ra.\nOne can be found sealed off at the end of a deep maze in the Relic Castle after defeating Team Plasma and talking to one of the Seven Sages who was planning to capture it for his lord, Ghetsis. A Volcarona is used by Pokémon League Champion, Alder. The Pokémon BW: Rival Destinies episode \"Guarding the Guardian of the Mountain!\" prominently features Volcarona as the protector of a sacred mountain.",
