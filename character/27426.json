  "description" : "Tynamo, known as the Electric Eel Pokémon. It is based on young electric eels and lampreys. A single Tynamo`s electrical power is tiny, but when a group comes together, that power is \"as mighty as thunder\". These Pokémon move in schools. They have an electricity-generating organ, so they discharge electricity if in danger.",
