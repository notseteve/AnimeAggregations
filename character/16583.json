  "description" : "When Midori was about 18 years old, a serial hit-and-runner was stalking the streets, randomly targeting high school girls wearing long skirts, due to harrassment by a girl gang he had suffered under (the girls had been wearing long skirts as well). When Midori`s best friend ended up the first fatality, she decided to help apprehend the killer and volunteered to act as a decoy. She was teamed up with http://anidb.net/ch8183 [Megure Juuzo], then still a junior police officer.\nUnfortunately, the car runner surprised and hit them both. But Megure was able to remember the car`s license number, and the perpetrator was soon arrested. Midori was gravely injured in the accident, but recovered with only a scar on her forehead to show for her ordeal, and some time afterwards she married Megure out of gratitude. In a strange switch of role, she is perhaps the only person who has managed to temper his impulsive surges, a role her husband feels a bit bashful about.\nMidori has also appeared, in an unseen role, as a witness to a crime and had to be taken to the station for questioning, as well as making a cameo appearance during the White Day Murder Case.",
