  "description" : "Hattori Akira begins as Akito Takagi`s and Moritaka Mashiro`s editor. He helps them with their pen name and eventually gets them serialized for Detective Trap. Once it becomes serialized, however, Akira loses them to Miura Gorou due to conflicting responsibilities, and soon becomes Iwase Aiko`s editor. After The Perfect Crime Club is serialized, Akira returns as Ashirogi Mutou`s editor, leading Gorou to edit Aiko`s work. He comes up with the idea of having Eiji and Aiko collaborate on Natural in order to inspire Moritaka and Akito to work harder.",
