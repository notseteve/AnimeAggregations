  "description" : "Kirenenko wears a prison uniform with red stripes, number 04. He has a safety pin stuck through his left ear. Originally a mafia boss, he was sentenced to death. He once had a twin brother. Generally quiet, but very dangerous when he becomes angry and goes berserk. He likes order and does not forgive anyone who crosses his path or otherwise \"meddles\" in his life. He collects sneakers (shoes) and is generally oblivious (apathetic) to the world around him while he reads his magazine advertising sneakers. He cares for nothing but his sneakers.",
