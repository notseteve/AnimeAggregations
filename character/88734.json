  "description" : "Assassin of Red is http://anidb.net/ch88727 [Shirou Kotomine]`s Servant.\n[spoiler=\"True Name and Noble Phantasm\"]Her true name is Semiramis, the Wise Queen of Assyria. Born from the Syrian mermaid goddess Derketo and a human man, she was left on the waterfront by her loveless mother. She was wrapped in the warm wings of a dove, and fed with the dove`s milk. Semiramis was then found and educated by the shepherd Simmas until she married Onnes, an old general; but she was then taken away by the Syrian king Ninus who fell in love with her thanks to her beautiful face. This forced Onnes to commit suicide, and after Semiramis earned the favors of the king with original battle plans, she married him and formally became queen. A few days after the marriage, she killed the king with poison, and reigned as a regent over Assyria for the next few decades. This is the oldest case of murder by poisoning in legends.\nShe uses poison as her weapon but also has the ability to summon two Primeval Serpents. Her Noble Phantasm is the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, where she can construct a massive flying fortress.[/spoiler]\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
