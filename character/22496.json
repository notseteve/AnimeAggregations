  "description" : "Tracey`s Marill was revealed when Tracey decided that he needed a good Pokémon to help him find the Crystal Onix. Tracey`s Marill has very sensitive ears that can detect distant sounds and the round, rubbery tip of its tail can expand and contract, assisting Marill in the water. While swimming, Tracey`s Marill tail floats so he can see where it`s going.\nMisty realized that Tracey and his Marill make a good team as Tracey`s Marill could hear a Pokémon long before Tracey could even see it. Tracey would often play a Pokémon cry on his dex for Marill to help it learn what the Pokémon sounded like so it could search for that particular Pokémon. Tracey`s Marill ears would twitch when it was searching or it found something.",
