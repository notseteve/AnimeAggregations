  "description" : "Domon was a participant in the Donamite. He faced Masaomi in the first round. Domon had a lot of expectations for this battle and the tournament but in a few short moments he quickly realized that he was outmatched. Masaomi`s Nageki faced Domon`s Mienshao and Masaomi`s Nageki showed its incredible strength by using a three move combo: Superpower, Seismic Toss and the finishing move Circle Throw. Domon`s Mienshao was knocked out before it was even able to land a successful blow. With the loss, Domon was eliminated from the tournament while Masaomi advanced to the second round.",
