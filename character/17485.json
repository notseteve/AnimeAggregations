  "description" : "Operator is a fictional class of robot in the Ghost in the Shell series. The Operators are designed to handle various tasks within the government agency http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Public Security Section 9], such as operating computers, carrying equipment within the agency`s building, and even crewing aircraft. Physically they are gynoids, seen wearing office lady-style suits. In one episode, additional Operators are seen coming out of the walls to replace disabled units during a particularly strenuous task, suggesting that Section 9 has many in backup and that the units are switched regularly.\nTheir physical appearance is of a female wearing an office lady`s suit. They have brown hair tied in a pony tail with brown eyes. It should be noted that they happen to be some of the most advanced Operators in the series besides http://anidb.net/ch17490 [Prot]o who is a prototype bioroid.",
