  "description" : "Yansu is the runner of Team Red Meteor and he runs alongside their car during races. His father did everything in his power to find the ultimate Dendimushi which was even alternately colored. He is very cocky and sure of himself and according to Rotom Pok√©dex, he is 100 percent unpleasant. Yansu`s brother Hayate is also on the team.\nHe competed in the 25th Kokeko Cup where they were the self-imposed favorites to win the race and his brother`s pushy nature ended up being too much for their Dendimushi car which got stuck on ice going up a hill in the 3rd and final stage, resulting in them loosing the race to Sophocles`s Charjabug car.",
