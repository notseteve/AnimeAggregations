  "description" : "Takuto`s Latios was sent out to battle Ash during the semi-final round of the Sinnoh League. Latios had never previously been sent out during any of Takuto`s battles in the Sinnoh League or during his Sinnoh gym matches as his Darkrai had never been defeated until Satoshi`s Sceptile defeated it. Ash`s Pikachu faced Latios and the two ended up knocking each other out at the same time.",
