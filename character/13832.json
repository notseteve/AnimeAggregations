  "description" : "Treize is the son and one of the fraternal twin children of Carr Benedict and Fiona, and Lillia`s closest friend. Looks to form a relationship with Lillia similar to that which Allison and Wil had in their younger days. Being a son of Fiona, he is also the Prince of Ikstova, though Lillia is unaware of this and only sees him as a childhood friend. He is worldly and does not really care for his royal heritage, and wishes that he can be like a normal civilian, and not be a subject to political favors among royal families.",
