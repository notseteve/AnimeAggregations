  "description" : "The reincarnation of Genbu the Black Tortoise of the North (Winter). He is the sensible, calm and brooding member of the group and its second-in-command, leading it in Gou`s absence.\nIn Tenshi no Shippo: He bypassed Ayumi while she was doing groceries. He later saw her again when the three tricked Gorou into working at an abandoned site under the pretense of a part-time job but to use him as a sacrifice to revive Gou. It was here that he fell in love with her enough to save her from the collapsing building. He later made her his bride, both being closely related animals (shelled reptiles). However, when the four joined Gorou`s side, Ayumi unconsciously hints that the relationship may not be one sided even before her abduction, the same goes for Yuki and Gou and Tsubasa and Rei, and later perhaps, Tamami and Gai. His Saint Beast counterpart constantly wears glasses and has shoulder-length blue-green hair, unlike the original Shin, who only wore his glasses in disguise, as well as having shorter black hair. Sacred Power: Shield of the Black Turtle. Shell Shards.\nIn Saint Beast: Shin has an affinity for tortoises and plays the golden harp (or a harp-like instrument). He received the Shield of Genbu from Zeus (which is almost 3/4 his size and looks like the back of a turtle). He is very close to Kirin no Yudas and is very calm and quiet. He also has the ability to manipulate time but using such power has a backslash. First, he needs a lot of energy and also his life is at risk. He used it once and he was unconcsious for 1 whole week.\nAttribute: Wind\nAbility: Manipulating time\nAttack: Wind Arrow\nImage Color: Black",
