  "description" : "Kouetsuji Akisame is a 38-year-old philosophical Jujutsu master who was the first master willing to train Ken`ichi (though ironically he seems to be the only masters that does not believe in him, though this may be an act) and an old friend of Miu`s father, Saiga. Despite his seemingly small physique, he is actually known for having his muscles built to perfection. He also has very good insight on people, often knowing if they are troubled or hiding something; he sometimes even knows what a person is thinking, which scares Ken`ichi.\nHe also owns an orthopedic clinic, and can reset and fix bones with ease.",
