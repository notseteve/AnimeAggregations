  "description" : "Vibrava vibrate their wings incredibly fast, generating ultrasonic waves. These waves are potent enough to cause prey to faint. They will then devour their prey after spraying their hides with acid to decompose the body for easier digestion. The ultrasonic waves they create can also cause headaches in humans. As their wings are not fully developed, they instead use them for the purpose of stunning foes and prey. They can still fly short distances, however.",
