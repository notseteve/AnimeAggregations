  "description" : "Intelligent magical sword, can talk and use some magic; shrinks to its passive form where it looks like the head of an animal but forms a blade of about four yards length when used in battle.\nOriginally wielded by http://anidb.net/ch25713 [Gigelf Liqueur] (both fought together in the days of the \"Silent Crisis\").\nGrospoliner was \"sealed\" after the war. A generation later http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Katsumi Liqueur] breaks this seal, and they form a pack of blood during episode 8. Occasionally Grospoliner acts as Katsumi`s tactical adviser (rather in the Silent MÃ¶bius movies than in the TV series).",
