It was revealed when Hagoromo-Gitsune became the nine-tails, he no longer had a place by her side as it was replaced by Minagoroshi Jizou who had altered Ibaraki Douji, Shoukera, Kyokotsu and Kidoumaru`s memories. He stated this is the only time he cannot accept the birth of the Nue because Minagoroshi Jizou had made a fool out of him and he will stop it without fail.
