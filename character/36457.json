While claiming to be fighting for \"Justice\", his view of justice is very different as to him, justice is the one who wins. His tape recorder called the Justice Diary (正義日記 Seigi Nikki), has the ability to tell him what evil deeds that will happen in the future which range from normally criminal like plotting murder to the nonsensical like littering. Furthermore, his diary can hypnotize people by giving them illusions.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch25306 [Yuno] kills him by decapitating him when he tried to kill http://anidb.net/ch36460 [Tsubaki] by suicide bombing.\nA running gag with him is his real face is never seen, at one point going as far as to wear two separate bags on his head so as to continue hiding it even after having it removed.\nHe is named after the Roman god Pluto.\nSource: wiki",
