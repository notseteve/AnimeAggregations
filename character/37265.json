During the 287th Hunter`s Exam, Illumi disguised himself as Gittarackur, using special pins to change his entire facial structure. Illumi holds a twisted and emotionless love for Killua. He and Silva raised Killua to believe that the only thing sustaining him was darkness, and that the only joy he received through the world was in causing the death of others. He was also responsible for planting a needle within Killua`s brain, forcing the latter to run from battles he was not sure he could win. Illumi did this to ensure that Killua would able to live to carry on the family business and as a means of protecting his little brother. This needle is self-extracted by Killua in the battle against Rammot. A certain amount of friendship is shared between Hisoka and Illumi, although it is unclear as to how it developed. Illumi once came to the aid of Hisoka by standing in for him as a double in the Phantom Troupe`s hideout, whilst Hisoka attempted to find Chrollo.",
