  "description" : "Some time ago, a girl`s father`s business was about to declare bankruptcy. In desperation, her father decided to cash in on the large life insurance policy he had taken out on his daughter, Angelina. Her father set up an \"accident\" where Angelina was hit by a car while she was out getting groceries with her dog Perro. After the incident, Angelina was chosen by the SWA to be the first girl to undergo the cybernetic augmentation and conditioning process. Now known as Angelica, she later became a model for the refinement of the child assassin program. Unfortunately, Angelica was also the first to experience the problems of the conditioning process, especially long-term memory loss. Angelica does not understand the disinterest of her handler, Marco, and the conditioning process left her with an overwhelming desire for his approval. Angelica, unlike the others, was not chosen by her handler, and did not at first receive brainwashing.\nAngelica`s preferred weapon is the Steyr AUG A2, after previously using the Beretta 84.",
