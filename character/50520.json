  "description" : "The QF-2200D is a small, lightweight, high-maneuverability stealth unmanned reconnaissance fighter whose mass production began in 2002. After exhausting skilled pilots in the chaos of the early stages of the U.N. Wars, the U.N. Forces released this to the frontlines in large quantities. Since it was designed and produced with existing technologies and without using almost any OTM, it was suitable for mass production without much manufacturing costs. Deployed aboard http://anidb.net/ch50482 [CVN-99 Asuka II].\nIt was developed mainly to conduct armed reconnaissance at relatively low altitudes at high speeds. However, because it can use its superior stealth, small lightweight size, mounting of an unusually powerful engine that is nevertheless difficult for detection nets, and the maneuverability to exceed a maximum instantaneous level of 25G since it carries no pilot, it is even utilized for its fighting strength over the main fighters in close-in combat situations.\nThe ratio of maximum speed to engine thrust is low because its maximum speed is limited, due to how difficult it is to maintain both heat resistance and stealth at higher speeds with existing materials. Control is by an autonomous AI, but of course there is the capability for remote control from the surface or satellite also.\nSource: http://macross.anime.net/wiki/QF-2200_Ghost",
