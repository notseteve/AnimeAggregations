  "description" : "Sanjuan Wolf is a colossal giant, known as \"Colossal Battleship\" for his size, and was originally one of the legendary criminals who was given a life sentence in Level 6 of Impel Down, as his crimes were so atrocious they had to effectively be erased from history itself. He was initially mentioned briefly by Emporio Ivankov. He was eventually freed from prison by Marshall D. Teach, and since then became a member of the Blackbeard Pirates.",
