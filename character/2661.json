  "description" : "Cyrus is Team Galactic`s leader.\nCyrus disregards all emotions, thinking of them as products of a weak human heart. His goal is to remake the universe in his own image, with himself as the god. He was born and raised in Sunyshore City, as noted in Diamond and Pearl by an elderly couple residing there. When Cyrus was young, he was a very good student; however, he was antisocial, preferring the company of machines over humans.\nHe made his first appearance in DP096 and DP097, along with Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. It was revealed that he is a rich businessman who has made most of the buildings in the Sinnoh region. However, Ash and the others do not know that he is also the Team Galactic leader. Using his businessman alter-ego, he visits the Celestic Town museum while the remaining members of Team Galactic carry out a plan to steal the Lustrous Orb and the Adamant Orb from the museum.\nHe discovers from Ash and Dawn that they have seen Azelf and Mesprit when the two tell of their encounters with the mysterious Pok√©mon at Lake Verity and Lake Valor. This apparently intrigues him, indicating that he will have future, possibly not as friendly, encounters with the group.",
