  "description" : "Staff of Easter Company. Utau`s manager, was competing with Nikaidou to see who is the first to find the Embryo. Yukari dated Nikaidou in the past.\nShe came up with a new project \"Black Diamond\" to at the same find the Embryo and mass-produce X eggs. The CDs of the band were freely distributed and the people listening to it had their Eggs removed by force. As the band became more famous their song is slated to be released to the Internet together with the unveiling of the band. In Seiyo it is branded as a cursed CD. Kairi snuck the CD into Tadase`s bag. When Tadase listened to it, he became infected causing Kiseki to almost change into an X egg, but Amu came and saved him.\nAfter she quit Easter, she and Utau open a company of their own and Utau continues to pursue her career.\nEver since then, Yukari has become friends with the Guardians, though they don`t get along very well.",
