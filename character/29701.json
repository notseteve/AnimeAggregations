  "description" : "Described by Toriko as the most powerful of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" for his pure destructive capabilities, Zebra is a very large and well-built man with scars that cover most of his body, one of the more striking ones being the half Glasgow smile on the left side of his face. His personality is very angry and small-tempered, he enjoys fighting the most out of all the Heavenly Kings and has a self-professed hatred for anyone or anything acting \"cocky\". He is incredibly strong, having single handily caused all the scars on Match`s body, killing dozens of prisoners in \"Honey Prison\" in the matter of minutes, and destroying many beasts with a capture level above 60, including the Magma Tortoise (CLV 70). He is held in \"Honey Prison\". He and the other Four Heavenly Kings were trained by Ichiryuu, the president of the IGO.",
