  "description" : "Kei`s aunt and nurse of the local clinic. A warm, kind-hearted and quite attractive woman who puts up with her husband`s behaviour only so much before she starts to get really angry at him. It is evident that she is the more mature member of their pair, and is quite able to curb Minoru`s wayward eye and lecherous comments with a significant look or gesture. She is not above using a small degree of force to cause her husband to `heel` if his behaviour gets too outrageous. She seems very sexually amorous towards her husband and loves him deeply. She is very supportive of Kei and Mizuho`s relationship, backing Minoru`s initial lie to the Headmaster about the couple being married, and then providing a second-hand wedding dress for Mizuho to wear in a private ceremony with only her, Mizuho, Kei and Minoru present.",
