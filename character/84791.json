  "description" : "For his entire life, Krory lived in a secluded castle. In his childhood he grew up with his Grandfather among a huge collection of foreign artifacts. Prized among these were rare carnivorous plants that would attack if they sensed aggression.\nDue to the castle they lived in and the plants` tendency to attack any guests, rumors began to spread in the nearby village that the inhabitants were Vampires. Shunned by the village and left in isolation, Krory began to feel as if he was just another piece in his grandfather`s collection.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki",
