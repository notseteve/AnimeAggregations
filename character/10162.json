  "description" : "Wealthy socialite and president of the powerful financial consulting firm \"Teiai\" (\"Love Emperor\"), not to mention owner and sponsor of underground gambling tournaments like those onboard Espoir. He is believed to be seventy years old and worth several hundred billion yen. Driven mad by wealth, conventional hobbies fail to entertain him, so he funds gambling tournaments to watch the destitute of society struggle against overwhelming terror and despair.\nHe meets Kaiji in the final segment of the first series of manga, where Kaiji is selected by lottery to compete in the \"Castle of Despair\". Hyoudou`s talents for winning in anything have earned him the title of \"king\" by some, though others merely call him \"very lucky\". His first full manga appearance was in volume 8 - prior to that, all readers saw of Hyoudou was his finger tapping.\nSource: Wikipedia",
