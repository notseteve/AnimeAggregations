  "description" : "Monferno is the evolution of Chimchar. Its tail is similar to those of Charmander due to the flames at the tips. This flame is often used as a weapon. When threatened, Monferno increases the size of its flame in order to appear larger than it really is, which is useful in scaring off attacking foes. It has white hair around its neck and gold arm bands. Monferno can climb onto walls to shoot aerial attacks.",
