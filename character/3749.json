  "description" : "The Cuarta Espada, signified by the \"4\" tattooed to his chest. His name stems from that of a furniture designer named Patricia Urquiola. He has a largely stoic appearance, rarely even changing his facial expression, and does not allow the actions of others to impede the tasks set to him by http://anidb.net/ch3746 [Aizen Sousuke]. He will attack his comrades to get them to pay attention to him, and deems anyone he does not find of particular interest to be \"trash\" and therefore expendable.\nSource: wiki",
