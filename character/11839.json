  "description" : "Fate Averruncus first appeared in Kyoto Arc. He was intrduced as one of Chigusa`s henchmen, but soon made clear that he is far more dangerous than one would suspect. He is well versed in both western and eastern magic, as well as in close combat. Fate can be considered one of the strongest characters introduced up to date. That time in Kyoto, only Evangeline`s timely appearence allowed the heroes to fend him off. As for his personality, he is overly polite and yet, shows hints of being rather short-tempered later in the series. Eva stated that he moves like a construct, which hints at his artificial nature.\nAverruncus returns to take the place of the main antagonist in ~Another World~.",
