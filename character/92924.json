  "description" : "A prideful, quick-thinking, and often domineering catgirl. She loves having the latest brand-name products, and never purrs for anyone except when she wants something from Shigure. She typically speaks frankly, but remains attentive to the attitudes of those around her. She is, as the saying goes, a scaredy-cat, always turning on every light on the way to the bathroom at night. Out of all of the catgirls, her tongue is the most sensitive to hot things.",
