  "description" : "Cleo Aiolos Corbeille de Veil is a supposed descendant of the royal family who has gathered a crew of people who are wanted all over the galaxy. Cleo`s personality is \"like the wind\", it`s unpredictable where his next destination will be or which way he wavers. His rough, seemingly, uncaring personality was shown bluntly to Michel and his followers when they first meet after being saved by him. At first he seems more like a pirate than a savior, only caring about material things than anything or anyone else as he wishes for payment for saving Michel.",
