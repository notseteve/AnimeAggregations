  "description" : "A space warship constructed during Haman`s War, which broke out in U.C. 0088. The Nahel Argama has been extensively upgraded and is now assigned to the Londo Bell unit of the Earth Federation Forces as an assault landing ship. Its handling is poor, and its compatibility is low because there are no other ships of this type, and so it mainly operates by itself. Its captain is Otto Mitas.",
