  "description" : "Erin is a 10-years-old girl, described as kind, collected, earnest, and very observant. Due to the influence of her mother http://anidb.net/ch7453 [Soyon], she carries a unique perspective in caring for beasts. Many people think that she is too curious, which simply gets her in trouble.\nErin is truly caring towards people and animals, even to the point of worrying more about others than herself. She is strongly against using the Touda for war and dreams that one day humans and beasts may understand each other and that beasts would not be bound by human`s codes.\nSource: Wikipedia",
