  "description" : "A radical patriot. Ex-member of the female Wide Range Communications Platoon and a CIA Special Activities Division operative. Stationed in Afghanistan after her fiance was killed in the September 11 attacks, but was discharged for her radical methods that violated International Law. Hex was later recruited by Bookman to crack down on arms dealers. Koko bears a grudge against her because she killed Echo, one of Koko`s subordinates, a few years ago. She later goes against Bookman`s order and repeatedly attempts to kill Koko, causing R`s death when he buys time for Koko to escape. It is implied that she commits suicide when she sees the B-52 sent by Koko coming for her in the mountainous region of Iraq, though her ultimate fate remains unknown.",
