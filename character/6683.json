  "description" : "The Alexandria is the first in a new series of Earth Federation space cruisers specifically designed to serve as mobile suit carriers. While its modular construction is reminiscent of Zeon`s old Musai cruiser, an Alexandria-class vessel can carry an entire squadron of mobile suits, allowing a single ship to operate as an independent taskforce. The Titan fleet includes several of these cruisers, but the most familiar is the Alexandria itself, which is usually commanded by Jamaican Daninghan or Gady Kinsey.",
