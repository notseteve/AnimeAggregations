  "description" : "Gray Fullbuster is one of the main male protagonists. He is an 18-year-old wizard who uses a form of magic called Ice Make (氷の造形魔法), which allows him to instantaneously create ice and mold it into various kinds of weapons, shields, and other inanimate objects.\nHe has a habit of stripping down to his underwear, often without realizing it, which he developed as a result of his training to withstand the freezing temperatures.\nWhile normally calm and collected, Gray has a fierce rivalry with http://anidb.net/ch11801 [Natsu] due to their opposing magic types, which constantly leads the two to bicker and insult each other.\nSource: wikipedia",
