  "description" : "Azusagawa Sakuta is a strange 2nd year student in high school, who doesn`t have a cellphone in this day and age. He`s currently an outcast at school due to rumors of a violent past... but he doesn`t seem to care.\nSakuta is a nice and helpful person, but also very snarky. He`s definitely blunt, honest and straightforward towards Mai, and prone to lewd jokes that even intimidate her, despite her tendency to tease the guy.\nSakuta is a typically selfless hero, and his Hero Syndrome is essentially a consequence of the Adolescence Syndrome that involved his sister Kaede first of all, and later all the other main girls of every arc.\nSource: Official site & Wikipedia",
