  "description" : "The mysterious leader of the Neo Zeon remnant forces who is described as the \"2nd coming of Char\". Like Char Aznable, he is a blonde man whose face is hidden behind a mask, and he wears a red uniform and pilots a red mobile suit. Similar to Char, he holds the Neo Zeon remnants together with his high charisma. Whether the name is an alias is unspecified. On the contrary, his name holds the meaning of \"stark naked\"(or fully exposed) although it could easily be reference to a full frontal assault. He plays around Banagher and the others with his puzzling speech and behaviour. He is fighting against the Earth Federation for \"the secret\" of the foundation of the Universal Century.\nHis face and tone closely resemble Char`s. Nahel Argama`s captain Otto, who watched Char`s archived recordings, remarked that the voice is just like it. He is later revealed to be a cyber NewType who was genetically altered to resemble the missing-in-action Char Aznable. His memories were then implanted from the psycho frame of one of the Mobile suits previously piloted by Char (possibly Sazabi).",
