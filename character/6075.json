  "description" : "Glen is often seen as Iria`s older brother and a full fledged hunter. In episode 5 however, it is hinted by Fujikuro that Glen might not be Iria`s brother but is possibly her onii-san, (a Japanese term used for both older brothers and close older male figures). He taught Iria much of what she knows about hunting and serves as a mentor for her apprenticeship. He wears a blue cloak and hair beads which are similar to Iria as well as an unusual pendant which is later found by Kei. Glen is thought to have died in the explosion of the Karma in the first episode but later found to have been assimilated by Zeiram.",
