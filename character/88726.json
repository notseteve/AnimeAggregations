  "description" : "Sieg is a http://anidb.net/t2027 [homunculus] who is initially nameless. http://anidb.net/ch88738 [Rider of Black] became his Servant after http://anidb.net/ch89997 [his former Master] got killed by http://anidb.net/ch88728 [Saber of Red].\nHe was created by Yggdmillennia as one of their many homunculi suited for various purposes, initially as a magical energy energy supply for Servants, later as a part of http://anidb.net/ch88739 [Caster of Black]`s golems` cores. Due to his unexpectedly high quality magic circuits, he was considered a good choice for Caster`s Golem Keter Malkuth.\nEventually, he managed to escape from his tank and, after he fell due to exhaustion, Astolfo carried him to his room. http://anidb.net/ch88736 [Chiron] treated him and mentioned that he has only 3 years to live and that he should use them well. With Astolfo`s help, he managed to escape the castle where he was held. Shortly after that, he was gravely wounded by http://anidb.net/ch89996 [Gordes], but saved by http://anidb.net/ch88735 [Siegfried] who sacrificed himself and gave him his heart. Out of gratitude and respect, homunculus gave himself a name after his savior.\nEventually, after he got gravely wounded once again—this time by Mordred—he gained the ability to transform into a Servant in Siegfried`s form for a short amount of time.",
