  "description" : "Shadow is an artificial created life form in the design of a male, anthropomorphic hedgehog. He resembles Sonic in many ways, such as how his hover skates propel him at extreme speeds to rival those of Sonic; but he distinguishes himself with greater use of his signature ability to use Chaos Control with Chaos Emeralds. He is Sonic`s rival and is the anti thesis of Sonic himself in all aspects of Shadow`s life.\nRings in his hands are sealing his true power.",
