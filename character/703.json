She is Jun`ichi`s adopted sister, actually in love with Jun`ichi and becomes mad when any other girl shows affection to him and uses `accidental` violence to stop the affection between him and another person. She wears a bell as an accessory, given to her by Jun`ichi when they were young. When her mood turns sour, she becomes excessively polite and antisocial, a condition that Jun`ichi calls \"hidden Nemu\".
