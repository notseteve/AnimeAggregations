  "description" : "This masked warrior is Oz`s top mobile suit pilot. Up until now, Oz has disguised itself as the Earth Federation`s elite \"Specials\" taskforce, and Zechs has accumulated numerous distinctions during his career in the Specials. He earned the highest marks in the history of the Lake Victoria military academy, received the first two-rank promotion in the history of the Specials, and acquired the nickname \"Lightning Baron\" for his exploits. Zechs` accomplishments have made him a hero among Oz`s soldiers, but this master soldier is cunning enough not to overestimate his own abilities or underestimate those of his enemies.",
