Tooru resembles Kazehaya personality-wise and looks extremely refreshing, except much more mature. He lives three hours away from his parents` house and returns home to get married. He cares about Ryuu and Chizuru a lot and loves Chizuru like a little sister. He calls her Chi because when she says it, it looks like she`s smiling.",
