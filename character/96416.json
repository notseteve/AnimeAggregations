  "description" : "The 10th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch777 [Ulanfu]. Under his command the 10th Fleet fought in a number of major battles in the final years of the Allianceâ€“Imperial War.\nThe 10th Fleet was one of the three Alliance fleets engaged at the Third Battle of Tiamat, where it was never in heavy combat, but played a vital role nonetheless in covering the defeated 11th Fleet during its retreat after the 11th`s commanding officer, Vice Admiral Willem Holland, was killed in a perfectly executed Imperial counter attack orchestrated by Imperial Admiral http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm].\nThe 10th Fleet, like most of the Alliance Star Fleets, later suffered heavy losses during the Alliance invasion of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire]. Before the decisive Battle of Amritsar, the 10th fleet lost half of its combat potential after it was hemmed in and besieged in planetary orbit by Imperial Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch191 [Fritz Joseph Bittenfeld]`s http://anidb.net/ch96402 [Black Lancers].\nOutnumbered and desperately low on supplies, 10th Fleet`s position soon became too precarious to maintain, forcing Ulanfu to attempt a forced breakout using the tightly packed spindle formation. Ulanfu was killed leading this attack through the Bittenfeld`s siege formation, and only about 50% of 10th Fleet`s ships escaped successfully.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
