  "description" : "Katsura Yukiji is the twenty-eight year old sister of Hinagiku. She is a world history teacher at http://anidb.net/ch16459 [Hakuou Academy] and doubles as a twenty-four-hour gate guard. She refuses to let http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate] enter the school when they first meet because she is afraid that letting unauthorised personnel on campus will result in a salary deduction for her. Her attitude softens after Hayate first saves her from falling off the clock tower, but she still almost causes Hayate to be rejected from Hakuou by unnecessarily making him anxious during his entrance exam. She repays Hayate by telling everyone in her class on Hayate`s first day that he is a super cool person. She has a group of underachieving students (http://anidb.net/ch640 [Izumi], http://anidb.net/ch641 [Miki], and http://anidb.net/ch642 [Risa]) who hang out with her a lot. She lives on the Hakuou campus; she tells Hayate that she does this so that she can save rent money and use that money to buy alcohol instead. It is a recurring gag that she will do anything for money, going as far as to allow an evil spirit to possess her because it told her it would give her a million yen. When http://anidb.net/ch612 [Makimura Shiori] is sent to teach at Hakuou, Yukiji is demoted to sub-homeroom teacher.",
