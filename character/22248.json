  "description" : "An upgraded version of the ZuOOT used during the previous war. Although the GAZuOOT remains unsuitable for combat against enemy mobile suits, its increased firepower and improved fire control systems enable it to provide more effective fire support than the original version. Because the previous shoulder cannons have been replaced with beam cannons, its model number includes the designation DE for Directional Emission. The GAZuOOT also carries a set of large missiles, and its arms end in cannons instead of general-purpose manipulator hands.",
