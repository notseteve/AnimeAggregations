  "description" : "Liang Qi is one of http://anidb.net/ch8970 [Alphard]`s top lieutenants. She affectionately refers to Alphard as an elder sister and is hinted to have been with Alphard ever since Alphard and http://anidb.net/ch10772 [Siam] had gone their separate ways. She appears calm and even-tempered, but is in fact unwavering, merciless, and very obsessed with admiring and idolizing Alphard to the point of being in love with her. To her frustration, however, Alphard does not reciprocate and instead ignores or even ridicules her from time to time. Her obsession with Alphard leads her into a mad desire to kill http://anidb.net/ch8969 [Canaan], believing that Alphard will then pay more attention to her.\nHalfway through the series, she eventually does lose her calm demeanor and acts irrationally, resulting to her death at the hands of http://anidb.net/ch9533 [Cummings], a man she supposedly worked as secretary for, and Alphard herself.\nSource: Wikipedia",
