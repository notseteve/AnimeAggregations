  "description" : "Valgo, a gigantic armored humanoid with batwings, is one of http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti]`s most devoted followers, but a bitter rival of http://anidb.net/ch43863 [Gavil]. He is capable of teleporting across space to his desired destination and attacking suddenly; he generates a large number of hideous pink monsters from a cavity in his chest; these creatures swarm over their prey, draining spiritia and growing larger. He is also capable of generating force fields which prevent spacecraft from space-folding, and uses this power to prevent the Macross 7 fleet from escaping the planet Lux, but he is destroyed (along with the planet) by http://anidb.net/ch49591 [Gigile].Source: wiki",
