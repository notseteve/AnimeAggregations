In the manga, Icchan is the president of the Piffle Company that creates the Angelic Layer toys. In the anime, Icchan is the \"father\" of Angelic Layer and creator, having developed the game over seven years with the help of Shuko Suzuhara. Icchan had been an employee at a hospital trying to treat Shuko`s neurological condition and were developing the angels as part of research to create prosthetic limbs which could be controlled by brain waves.
