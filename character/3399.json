  "description" : "Hiizumi Enjin is the main antagonist. A youkai who is determined to destroy the city for unknown reasons.\nEnjin was a member of the branch family of the Hiizumi household. He was tuned along with his relatives by the main branch centuries before and returns as a non-physical entity possessing the body of Ao`s older brother Gin. To enact revenge at the city, Enjin intends to force the seven pillars to bloom in an attempt to fuse the human and Youkai dimensions. Aside from Gin`s Satori powers, Enjin`s true power is Striking which is the opposite of Akina`s Tuning, summoning objects from the Youkai world instead. Enjin later reveals that he can also perform Tuning as well, but at a much smaller potential than Akina.\nSource: Wikipedia",
