  "description" : "Trident is an A-class Storm Rider team based in the Kansai region of Japan. Founded and led by Rumble King Yoshitsune, they were the most powerful team in Western Japan. Trident became a constituent of Genesis some time before the series began, making Yoshitsune one of the five Kings of Genesis. Their first appearance takes place during Kogarasumaru`s class trip to Osaka, which acted as an opportunity for Ikki to garner the approval of Trident in his bid for the leadership of Genesis.",
