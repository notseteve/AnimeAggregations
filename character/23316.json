Fearing for her life, she sought the protection of the Amakusa Catholics, but ran away from them as well as she didn`t trust them and feared they wanted the knowledge of the grimoire. After meeting Touma, she learns that both he and Amakusas were genuinely want to help her and rejoins them as battle nuns from the Catholic Church arrive to assassinate her. However, when they discover Orsola was never capable of deciphering the grimoire at all, the Catholic Church calls off the order to eliminate her and Necessarius grants her sanctuary.",
