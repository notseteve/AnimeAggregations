  "description" : "The Asagiri Shrine`s head priestess, the Miko Council`s mentor, and Yuzu`s homeroom teacher and older sister. She is extremely knowledgeable and intensely disciplined, and puts the Council (including her sister, who is already a priestess) through continual, rigorous training that borders on the sadistic. Her talisman items are a bow (she is a skilled archer) and a large ring that can encircle foes.",
