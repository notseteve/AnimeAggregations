  "description" : "Kublock is a world-famous director that Ash Ketchum and Goh went to see film a movie after Professor Cerise had arranged it with the movie studio for them. Their first encounter with him was seeing him yell at a Ditto on set because it wasn`t doing the take properly.\nMr. Kublock is so strict with Ditto because he believed that it could do much, much better than it was initially performing. He was the one who discovered Ditto in the first place.",
