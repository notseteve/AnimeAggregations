  "description" : "A mixed juice Steel Akikan who appears in the anime.\nHer can was girlished by a cat (the same cat that is usually found on the roof of Daichi and Melon`s house) who ran off right away. This caused her to have a hatred of Akikans, both Aluminum and Steel, with owners, and she began absorbing their powers and calling herself The Strongest Akikan. Her main cool drink sorcery is Rainbow Splash Mixer, and she also has the ability to make clones of the Akikans she had captured called Zeros. Since she was never given a name, Kakeru gives her the name `Miku`, a name she likes but doesn`t admit to it. Daichi offered the idea to be her Owner, something she considered until Otoya showed her a picture of her true Owner and ran off to find it. At the end of the series she is friends with the main cast and still chasing her Owner.",
