  "description" : "The titular character and the main female protagonist of the series is a transfer student of Butei High School. An \"Assault\" department elite rank S (The highest rank), she wishes to recruit Kinji after their encounter. She can wield two guns and two swords at the same time, earning the title of a \"Quadra\". Her weapons of choice are two Colt Government Model semi-automatic pistols, and two undersized Japanese swords known as Kodachi. The H in the middle name stands for \"Holmes\" as she is a descendant of Sherlock Holmes himself, and her full name is Aria Holmes Kanzaki IV. She is very short for her age and what is causing her stunted growth is a special HihiIrokane bullet embedded in her back. Irokane is a special element that can turn a normal human into a super power user. HihiIrokane is red Irokane that requires a childish nature and prideful personality to be able to use. Although Kinji learned about the special properties of the bullet and potential powers it gives from Holmes, Aria seems largely unaware of anything unusual about the bullet or herself. Just that some stranger shot her for an unknown reason and the bullet can`t be removed safely. As a side effect of the bullet lodged within her eye color and hair color, which were originally flaxen with sapphire blue eyes changed to a pinkish strawberry blonde and ruby colored eyes. Her mother is Japanese and her father is half English half Japanese. Her grandmother is a member of the British Royal Family, having received the title of a \"dame\". She also starts to have feelings for Kinji after they kissed on episode 5, and gets jealous when other girls approach Kinji.\nSource: Wiki",
