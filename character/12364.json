The Tobitas were a prominent household charged with being the land owners. He was next in line to inherit the family`s power, but someone did not agree with this. So big fights began, and the Tobitas were destroyed. Only Danzou and his sister survived, and in order to protect his sister, Danzou had to work under the people he hated. He became a war machine, and tried to escape reality by fighting. Her sister, knowing that she was the problem, threw herself from a cliff. Danzou could not forgive himself of being unable to protect his sister. So he burned his face and lived a life in solitude. He tried to kill the Shogun, but Hattori`s father stopped him. In the end, to stop his pain, he decided to get killed by someone who resembles him. So he raised a student, Tsukuyo, and taught her everything he knew. So Jiraia came back to Yoshiwara to take Tsukuyo. He defeated Gintoki, because he thought that he was one of Tsukuyo`s weakness. Then he burned the other Tsukuyo`s weakness, Yoshiwara. But thanks to Shinpachi, Kagura, Hattori and Hinowa, the fire was extinguished. Gintoki went to save Tsukuyo from Jiraia, and the fight began. Jiraia was defeated by Gintoki, but he was killed by Tsukuyo, like he wanted. He died looking at the moon, embracing Tsukuyo. He was the strongest man in the Oniwabanshu, and the one who created the Hyakka. His name is based on Jiraiya.",
