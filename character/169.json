  "description" : "Clefairy are small, bipedal Pokémon. Popular as pets for their adorable features, Clefairy have short, pink fur, with a large brown patch on each of their two pointed ears. Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. They have two small eyes, no nose, and a small mouth with one tiny, protruding fang. They also have a patch of darker pink fur under each eye, which seems to resemble blushing cheeks.\nClefairy can be seen playing in groups, on the night of a full moon, retreating to their group slumber when dawn arrives. These Pokémon are noted to be able to store moonlight in the wings on their backs, giving them the power to float in mid-air. There have been sightings of Clefairy, with their evolutionary forms Cleffa and Clefable, using spaceships, and the Moon Stones used to evolve Clefairy are also rumored to come from extraplanetary locations. Clefairy seem to be based on fairies, as they are magical, winged creatures, lending credit to their name. Also, their game call seems to make a sound similar to their Japanese name.\nClefairy`s biology is somewhat unclear. While they cannot truly fly with their wings, they do travel in a bouncy skipping walk, as if walking on the surface of the moon. When they wave their finger, it stimulates the blood and triggers their brain to perform random attacks from any other Pokèmon, which is the basis of their signature Metronome attack.",
