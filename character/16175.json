  "description" : "Negi`s cousin, often referred to as his onee-chan (sister), although he sees her more as a mother. Her gentle personality is largely based on interpretations through disjointed flashbacks, so it is hard to identify precisely what she is like. What has been indicated however is that she took on more of a motherly role in his life, as at one time she even risked herself to protect him from harm. She is someone that Negi cares greatly for and respects a lot. It has also been shown that she lost both her legs below the knees after having them partially turned into stone.",
