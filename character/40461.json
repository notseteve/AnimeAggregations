  "description" : "Clay`s Krokorok was the first Pok√©mon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay`s Krokorok was paired up against Ash`s Oshawott as Pikachu initially wanted to battle it but Ash realized that an Electric type against a Ground type would be a bad idea.\nAt the beginning of the battle, Clay`s Krokorok had the upper hand as its Sandstorm managed to get sand in Ash`s Oshawott`s eyes and it also made it harder for Ash`s Oshawott to accurately attack. Clay`s Krokorok managed to hit Ash`s Oshawott with a Bite and a Stone Edge attack but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Oshawott used Water Gun to clear up the Sandstorm and then it began its counterattack. Clay`s Krokorok was repetitively hit with multiple attacks from Ash`s Oshawott including a super effective Aqua Jet and Razor Shell combo that ended up being too much for it and it was knocked out.",
