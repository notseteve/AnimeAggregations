  "description" : "Cleffa is the pre-evolution of Clefairy, a small, bipedal creature, shaped like a five-pointed star. It has short pink fur, with a large brown patch on each of its two pointed ears. Between these ears is a large swirl of pink fur. It has two small eyes, no visible nose, and a small mouth. It also has a patch of darker pink fur under each eye. Cleffa first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, as one of the several pre-evolutions introduced into the series.\nCleffa love to stick their tongues out and are often seen hanging around other baby Pokémon such as Igglybuff. For unknown reasons, possibly due to its unusual star-shaped silhouette, when lots of meteors illuminate the night sky, sightings of Cleffa strangely increase. Some people believe that they came to the Pokémon universe on a meteor. If the impact site of any meteorite is found, this Pokémon is certain to be within the immediate area. On nights with many shooting stars, Cleffa can be seen dancing in a ringlike formation. They dance through the night and stop only at the break of day, when these Pokémon quench their thirst with the morning dew. Like Staryu, it is a Starshape Pokémon- consequently, scientists in the Pokémon universe are trying to find a connection between the two. In the same way its evolved form Clefairy loves the moon, Cleffa are fond of shooting stars.",
