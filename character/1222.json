  "description" : "Bronzong is the evolved form of Bronzor. It has the appearance of a giant steel bell with the yoke still attached based on zhou dynasty bells called zhong or Japanese dotaku bells. The combination of two red-colored circles and a gradient design between them give Bronzong a face with two eyes and a mouth. Its appearance is vaguely Aztec in design. Round eyes and sometimes mouths are a common pattern (called taotie) on shang and zhou bronze vessels.",
