  "description" : "Swampert lives and makes its nest offshore on various beaches. It has various abilities that allow it to live without fear of being targeted as prey. It has powerful vision that can see through even the depths of murky water. Its three fins sense subtle changes in the sounds and patterns of ocean waves and tidal winds to predict the oncoming of storms and tidal waves, respectively. Its great strength, allowing it to procure and drag boulders that can weigh a ton, lets it pile up boulders around its beach nest in order to weather the storms that it may predict. With its strength and its rock-hard arms, it can easily batter down a foe with a single swing and pull ships while swimming faster than a jet ski.",
