  "description" : "Mantyke is the pre-evolved form of Mantine, both resembling a manta ray. The backs of this species resemble smiling faces with red eyes, a trait shared with Spinarak. It can evolve into Mantine if it levels up with a Remoraid also in the trainer`s party (the Remoraid is not lost, so a new one strangely appears on the new Mantine).",
