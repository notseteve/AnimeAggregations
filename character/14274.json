  "description" : "The Aryan Socialist Union is a paramilitary group of aspiring stereotypical Neo Nazis styling themselves along the lines of the Nazi Sturmabteilung. Though it`s not explicitly stated, it is implied they are based in the United States (in the manga they were apparently all German-Americans, due to the way they spoke such as \"Fraulein\" or \"Jawohl\"). They have a large arsenal of weapons such as MAC-10 machine pistols, MG3 machine guns, AK47 assault rifles, Luger and Colt 45 pistols (in the manga, they carried multiple kinds of handguns) and even TOW Anti-Tank Missiles.\nHowever, they do not realize that they have been lied to and are being set up by Sir Alfred, the head of the Neo Nazi movement, who believes they are a waste. There are more than 30 of them aboard their recovery ship. It is unknown how many, if any, survived the conflict with the Lagoon Company.",
