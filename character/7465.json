  "description" : "Tsukikage no Knight, or the Moonlight Knight, appears in the anime only for the first half of Sailor Moon R, the Makaiju arc.\nThe Moonlight Knight is a very mysterious individual, appearing only when the situation demands his intervention and disappearing once matters had been resolved.\nHe shares many traits with Tuxedo Kamen, such as chivalry, a formal nature, and a penchant for announcing himself with a grand speech. He also throws white roses, instead of Tuxedo Kamen`s trademark red roses.\nThe Moonlight Knight mainly dresses in Arabian robes and carries a saber.\nThe true form of Tsukikage no Knight are Mamoru`s memories. When Mamoru`s memories had been locked away, his desire to protect Sailor Moon remained strong so his memories separated from him and concentrated into the Moonlight Knight.",
