  "description" : "Laira is a half-angel who was taken to the celestial world to become an angel trainee under Nanael`s supervision (much to the despair of those around). However, she was not pushed around by Nanael`s whims because of her \"my pace\" nature (doing things in her own pace), and it actually looked like she was the one in control. Despite this, they get along well. Nanael, who went on a rampage, ordered Laira to clean the chaos on the human world with the Divine Punishment using Holy Milk. Because she is not a true angel, Laira must wear the sacred tool Nephilim`s Wings, an artificial wing, to fly, and she is armed with the Heavenly Rifle which fires Holy Milk. At first Laira looks very cool-headed, but she makes so many mistakes that she might actually be very dumb. Created by http://anidb.net/cr29662 [Akaga Hirotaka].\nSource: Wikipedia",
