  "description" : "Ever since they`ve been children, Carla has loved Rupa. When one day Rupa showed Carla a picture of Lum, his bride-to-be, Carla changed from a childhood friend to a violent assailant. From then on she constantly threatened and terrorized Rupa out of jealousy. The more Carla would attack him, the more he`d try to distance himself from her (see any parallels here to Ataru and Lum?). Near the end of the movie Rupa finds that he doesn`t really want to marry Lum. He admits to Carla that he loves her and asks her to marry him. Of course she accepts.",
