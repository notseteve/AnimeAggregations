  "description" : "Nicholas D. Wolfwood, also known as Nicholas the Punisher. Nicholas is a traveling preacher, but contrary to his job as a man of God he`s quite devious and violent, a foil to his companion Vash`s peaceful and goofy nature. Wolfwood often criticizes Vash`s philosophy of not killing, stating that one day he`s going to have to. Despite this, he adopts Vash`s non-lethal style though he still kills when he feels it`s needed. Wolfwood carries a special, large cross-shaped gun called the Punisher, which contains a large machine gun in its bottom section and a rocket launcher at its top. In the anime the sides hold several Colt handguns. Wolfwood`s background and development are almost completely different between the manga and anime versions of the character.",
