  "description" : "Some girls get their ears pierced; some of them get missile launchers installed! At first glance it might be hard to notice that Chachamaru is anything more than Evangeline`s robotic minion, but there`s more to this lass than silicon and bolts. Her reputation outside of the school is far different than what Negi could have imagined. When the little magi and Asuna set out to battle the girly automaton, Negi must second-guess his plan to disable her. In the end, the computer in Chachamaru`s head just might lose out to her very human-seeming heart.",
