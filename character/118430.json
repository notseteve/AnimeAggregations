  "description" : "Akemi is a shy, bespectacled and quiet high school student who is a member of the Ms. Mizuno Fan Club along with her longtime friend Yuko and their other classmates. She is shown to be bisexual, as she can often seen blushing around girls and boys, including Kyoko`s boyfriend Tetsuji and possibly her biology teacher Tatsuya. Despite her preferences for both genders, she and Yuko are involved in a romantic and sexual relationship with each other which they`ve had for quite some time, even before the series events. In her spare time, Akemi enjoys reading books-(as shown when she was reading a book in the car) implying that she`s also a bookworm.",
