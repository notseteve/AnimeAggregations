  "description" : "Shedinja is a unique species of Pokémon that is quite literally the shed exoskeleton of a newly evolved Ninjask that has taken on a ghostly transformation of its own. Their hard-layered bodies are hollow and utterly dark, and they do not possess organs normally considered vital for life. There is a circular dark hole in its back which the Ninjask would theoretically climb out of after its evolution, and an old legend states that a Shedinja will steal the souls of anyone who looks into the opening on its back. Like shed exoskeletons, Shedinja are completely immobile and do not breathe.[3] They are able to float and hover, however, though its wings do not move. They also have a halo-like object above their heads, suggesting the iconography of death, as Shedinja is technically undead.\nIn the Pokémon games, due to its extremely frail nature, Shedinja only has one hit point no matter its level. To compensate, it has a unique ability known as Wonder Guard. Because of this ability, Shedinja can only be damaged by the five attack types which deal super-effective damage to it, namely, Fire, Flying, Rock, Ghost, and Dark type attacks. Weather effects such as hail or sandstorm will also harm Shedinja.\nIn Pokémon Sapphire, Ruby, or Emerald, Shedinja is not found in the wild, but can be unlocked if you leave an open space in your party and evolve Nincada. Shedinja will be located in the empty space.",
