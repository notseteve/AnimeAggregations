  "description" : "She is the beautiful but ditzy captain of the Nadesico and childhood friend of Akito Tenkawa. She is infatuated with him and gets very jealous when other girls show interest in him, though he considers her crazy; she is also very scatterbrained at times, misinterpreting comments made by others as words of inspiration/devotion, and forgetting or twisting around events from her and Akito`s childhood. Nonetheless, she is a very capable captain, and a constant source of cheerfulness and inspiration for the rest of the crew.",
