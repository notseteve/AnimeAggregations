  "description" : "Keiichirou is a student who lives by himself. He used to play guitar in a band, but stopped after his family was killed in a car accident while driving to one of his live performances. He is religious and prays for his family regularly. Although he is kind and not antisocial, he generally keeps to himself and reflects on the past. Thanks to http://anidb.net/ch14339 [Flower], he attempts to pick up the guitar a few times and in the end decided to sing again.\nSource: Wikipedia",
