  "description" : "Duke David Madison is the commander of Anatoray`s military defending the regions of Minagith and Norkia. Claus and Lavie`s attempt to cover his fleet`s retreat in the battle at Minagith using only their vanship inspired Mad-thane. Seeing the potential of a vanship in battle, he sponsors the formation of vanship squadrons to act as fighter support in the assault against the Guild. He is portrayed as an optimistic character who wishes for peace, once believing \"[t]here is hope yet for the world`s survival\" after meeting Disith commander Nestor Messina. Because of this attitude, he is often ridiculed by other commanding officers in the military who deem his actions are those of a coward.",
