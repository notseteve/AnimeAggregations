  "description" : "Sloth differs greatly in the first anime and in the manga and second anime. In the manga and the second anime, Sloth is a large, muscular, dim-witted man who believes everything to be pointless and tiresome.\nIn the first anime, Sloth was the product of Elric brothers` attempt to revive their mother, Trisha Elric, found by Dante and Envy while the horrified Elrics went to the Rockbell residence for help. Once able to assume her original form`s likeness, Sloth was able to assume a watery composition, which she uses to drown others by grabbing hold of them. In spite of it, Sloth constantly suffers from memories of Trisha raising the Elric brothers. Determined to prove to herself that those are Trisha`s memories and not her own, she longs to be able to kill the brothers, as a real mother could never kill her own sons. She develops a mother-son relationship with Wrath, and the two stick together during the second half of the first anime. During a battle with the Elric brothers, Wrath, having merged with Trisha`s remains earlier, merges with Sloth`s body so that he will never have to be separated from her. This leaves Sloth paralysed, allowing Edward Elric an easy opportunity to convert the water in her body into ethanol, which then evaporates into the atmosphere.",
