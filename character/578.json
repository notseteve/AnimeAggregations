  "description" : "Sonozaki Mion is the default leader of the group and class president since she is the oldest student in the school. She fosters a healthy best friend / rival relationship with Maebara Keiichi and despite her tomboy activities and language, she definitely has a more feminine side to her. As heir to the Sonozaki Family, she is privy to a wealth of information on the underground issues happening in and around Hinamizawa. She tends to have half of her hair pulled back into a ponytail.",
