  "description" : "With Pete at a disadvantage in the third round battle in the Kanto Pokémon League he turned to his Arcanine to make a comeback. Pete`s choice of Pokémon came to a suprise to some people as the battle was taking place on the ice field.\nKnowing about Arcanine`s type disadvantage to Kingler, Ash confidently ordered Kingler to use a Bubble attack, however, Arcanines speed on the icy terrain was quick and manage to dodge Kingler`s attack. After creating some space for itself Pete ordered Arcanine to use a Dragon Rage attack which dazed Kingler, forcing Ash to switch to Pikachu.\nJust like Arcanine, Pikachu proved to be agile on the ice and managed to dodge Arcanine`s Fire Blast attack. In an attempt to slow Pikachu down, Pete order Arcanine to melt the ice field which turned it into a pool of water using it Flamethrower and Fire Blast attacks.\nArcanine fired one last Fire Blast at Pikachu which it dodged by jumping into the newly formed pool. Ash ordered Pikachu to use Thunderbolt which electrified the pool and Arcanine who was standing on the final piece of ice. Arcanine fell into the pool and fainted, giving the round three victory to Ash.",
