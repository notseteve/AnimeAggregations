  "description" : "The last surviving Sanjiyan Unkara who was discovered by Yakumo`s father in Tibet. Yuzo Takada sometimes calls her the three-eyed elf girl from China, but she wears traditional Tibetan clothes. As is typical with members of her race, she developed a split personality as she grew older in order to cope with the problems of an exceptionally long life. However, Pai is the only Sanjiyan ever shown that has true multiple personality disorder.\nThe Pai personality is somewhat flaky, but caring and cheerful. The two personae are aware of one another, and sometimes talk between themselves.",
