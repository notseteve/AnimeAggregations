  "description" : "Lillipup is known as the Puppy Pok√©mon. The long hairs covering its face are excellent radars. It delicately senses the state of its surroundings.\nIn the anime, Lillipup appeared under the ownership of Lenora, where it won in a battle against Ash`s Tepig. Later, when it evolved into a Herdier, it lost against Ash`s Tepig during the Rematch in \"Rematch At The Nacrene City Gym.\"\nGamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson noted it as being initially weak, but becomes quite powerful in its final evolution. Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling called Lillipup the new Rattata.",
