  "description" : "Ramos` Jumpluff was the first Pok√©mon revealed in the gym match against Ash Ketchum where it faced off against Ash`s Fletchinder. Ramos` Jumpluff had a huge disadvantage against Ash`s Fletchinder since it is a Flying and a Fire type as it is a Grass type.\nDespite the disadvantage, it had ways of defending itself in battle. Its Chlorophyll Ability raised its speed due to Sunny Day and was able to dodge many of the moves. It wasn`t until Ash`s Fletchinder used multiple Flame Charge`s that its speed caught up and was able to hit it and knock it out.",
