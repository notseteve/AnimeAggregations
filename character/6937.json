  "description" : "Ryuuji`s thirty-three-year-old mother, though she refers to herself as eternally twenty-three; she has large, F-cup-sized breasts. She works at a hostess bar named Bishamontengoku where she goes by the name \"Mirano\", and single-handedly supports her two-member family financially. However, she has a childish personality and since she works, she entrusts the household chores to Ryuuji. She instantly takes a liking to Taiga and already regards her as a member of her family, getting depressed when Taiga will not appear for dinner. However, she does get angry when woken up early. Despite the childish behaviour, Yasuko proves to have a rather good insight of other people.\nThough she tells Ryuuji his father died before he was born, the truth is they were never married; he left her before Ryuuji was born, and she raised her son by herself.",
