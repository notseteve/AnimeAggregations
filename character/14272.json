  "description" : "The Gruppenf√ºhrer is the commander of the Aryan Socialist Union`s Suicide Corps, the recovery team who was sent to retrieve The Twelve Knights Led by Brunhilda from the U-1324. He is the only man, other than Ratchman, to get emotionally worked up over the latter`s bombastic pronouncement of his mission. Feller leads his men down to the U-1324 using a special diving pod to connect with the U-boat`s hatch. Getting caught up in a firefight with Revy, he is the only member of his team to set foot in the U-1324 to make it out alive, recovering the painting in the process.\nWhen Revy and Dutch assault the Aryan Socialist Union aboard their recovery ship, he attempts to arm himself with a MG42 to fight back, but is shot in the back by Revy in the ship`s magazine. In the manga, he is last seen fighting Revy inside the submarine; his fate afterwards is unknown.",
