  "description" : "The Novena Espada, signified by the \"9\" tattooed to his two faces. He has an unusual glass capsule filled with red liquid and two floating masks in place of a head, which he usually covers with a tall white mask. The two masks tend to talk in tandem when revealed, giving the effect of two people speaking in turn. The upper mask speaks with a deep voice while the lower mask speaks in a high-pitched, child-like voice, and they appear to have a level of individuality as the lower mask is more afraid of death, screaming blasphemy to Aizen when he dies while the upper mask merely curses one word. He is the last of the first-generation Espada.",
