She is described as a straight-A student, and has a rather no-nonsense personality. She`s very serious and reserved, and is a member of the dignified Yayoi family. In the true ending of Calamity Trigger, where she appears as a sub-character, she is assigned by Hazama to kill Noel and Jin.\nSource: Wiki",
