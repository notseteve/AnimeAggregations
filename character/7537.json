  "description" : "Hibiki Tokai is the male protagonist, as well as a stubborn and hot head third-class citizen of Taraak that gets thrown into the mess with Duelo and Bart. He was unwilling to do anything but hide when the Nirvana was attacked by Harvesters when they appeared halfway across the galaxy. However, after a talk from the sub-commander, BC, Hibiki gets into a Vanguard, in an attempt to help the female pilots fight the enemy. He is very rash but gets the job done, as well as often ends any enemy threat quickly.\nBy the end of the series, it is revealed he is the son of the empress of Mejere and emperor of Taraak, Lady Grand-ma and Lord Grand-pa respectively, who was frozen in hibernation, but awakened mysteriously around 14 years before the series began. His uncle, Grand-pa`s younger brother, whom he refers to as \"grandfather,\" took care of him when he emerged from cryostasis. It is also his rally to the two planets that convinces all of them that they should fight for their right to live when the Harvester fleet from Earth arrives.\nDuring the course of the series, Hibiki and Dita have an odd-couple relationship. In the initial episodes, Hibiki would run away from Dita every time she came after him, finding her very annoying. He even screamed at her, getting her to leave him alone, for which he indirectly apologizes to her later. Eventually, Hibiki gets used to being around Dita, often helping her out on board the Nirvana. He also falls in love with Dita`s cooking and eventually with Dita herself.\nAs the series progresses he grows more mature, having his own existence recognized by the other members of Nirvana, becoming a more strong pilot and person.\nSource: Wikipedia",
