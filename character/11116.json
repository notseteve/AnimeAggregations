  "description" : "The Z`gok is the most advanced of Zeon`s amphibious mobile suits. Its 360-degree mono-eye sensor and arm-mounted mega particle cannons enable it to fire in any direction. With both air- and water-cooling systems, the Z`gok can operate for long periods on land, and its rocket engines give it superb mobility even out of the water.",
