  "description" : "Latvia is the youngest of the three states. He gets bullied the most by Russia due to his blunt nature, but is also the most dependent on him. He is very short, which Russia often points out to him. Latvia believes he could have grown more if Russia would not push down on his head when annoyed, which lead Russia to attempt to stretch him instead. He is shown to also drink quite a lot of alcohol, despite his young age.",
