  "description" : "Tsareena is a Grass-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Steenee when leveled up while knowing Stomp. It is the final form of Bounsweet.\nTsareena is a bipedal, plant-like Pokémon with a humanoid appearance. Its torso, arms, and legs are dark purple, while its hips and head are white. On top of its head is a light green calyx. The shortest leaf of the calyx extends slightly forward and then curves to the right, similar to bangs. The other three leaves resemble long hair extending nearly to the ground and have many yellowish-green markings. On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes. It has heavy-lidded, dark purple eyes with purple eyelids and long eyelashes, but has no visible mouth or nose. The lower part of its face is hidden behind a short ruff extending up from its body. While its arms are slender with rounded, digit-less hands, it has long, powerful legs. The upper portions of its legs have three pointed projections just before the hips, creating the impression of long boots. The lower portion tapers to its small, pointed feet. It has wide hips made up of six segments.\nThis Pokémon has a high-class nature, and punishes anyone that approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands Tsareena dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. In battle, it attacks using finely honed kicking skills and graceful movements. Additionally, its fragrance acts as distraction in battle. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however. Because only the most powerful Steenee evolve into Tsareena, this Pokémon uses its power to protect its pre-evolutions.",
