  "description" : "Mute daughter of Huey Laforet and an excellent knife fighter. She joins her father`s followers in holding the passengers of the Flying Pussyfoot hostage, despite claiming to disapprove of such acts. She can communicate telepathically with Huey, though it is unknown whether the ability is hers, his, or mutual. Chane is devoted to her father, believing him to be the only person to ever love her. She later tells Claire to find her in Manhattan, saying she would always be waiting. It is revealed that, when offered anything for keeping Huey`s secrets, she asked him to take her voice so that she would never betray him, something Huey finds highly interesting. After the kindness of Jacuzzi and his gang, and Claire`s continued professions of love, her world begins to open up past the one that just included herself and Huey.",
