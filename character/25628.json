  "description" : "Rude is a member of the Turks in Final Fantasy VII, as well as appearing in several of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles. He is a tall, bald man with a little goatee. He always wears sunglasses and appears to carry spares on him in case something happens to the pair he is wearing. Rude is rarely seen without his long-time partner Reno and is rather quiet and taciturn, tending to relegate the talking to Reno. Rude is a superb physical fighter and prefers to use his fists in battle. He has a soft spot for Tifa Lockhart, demonstrated by the fact that he will not attack her if she battles him in their many encounters in Final Fantasy VII. In one of his rare lines of dialogue in Final Fantasy VII, he reveals to Reno he has a crush on Tifa, who is also a phenomenal physical fighter, although nothing ever comes of this crush.\nSource: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Rude",
