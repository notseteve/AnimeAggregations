  "description" : "Also known as Dan-kun, Danjuurou Eiga is a round and plain-faced first year who joins the Kendo Club with Yuuji. He originally wanted to join the Ping Pong Club, but there was no such club in the school. He shocks Yuuji and Kojirou when he brings his pretty girlfriend Miyako to join the club. While he finds the basic training to be \"boring\" (possibly because he wants to impress Miyako), he is rather proficient in scorekeeping.",
