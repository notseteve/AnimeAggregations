  "description" : "Kaneshiro Junya is a callous and ruthless organised crime boss operating in Shibuya. He especially targets high school students, tricking them into becoming unwitting drug mules and then blackmailing them with photographic evidence of this illegal activity. He has kept himself carefully hidden and not even the police were able to figure out that he was the true mastermind pulling the strings of crime in Shibuya. Some students of Shuujin Academy were victims of his scams. He thus became a target for the Phantom Thieves.",
