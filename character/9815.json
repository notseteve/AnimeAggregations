  "description" : "She gives the missions to the Night Wizard and seems to be in control. She lives in a castle which seems to be floating above Earth or in another dimension. Whenever she asks a Night Wizard to do a mission, she gives them no choice by pre-empting every mission she assigns with \"For the request that I will ask you now please reply `Hai` or `Yes`\". Despite her looks, she is much older than she seems. She comes off as an all-seeing person to everyone but Hiiragi whom she berates, embarrasses, uses against his will and torments. She doesn`t seem to care about anything she does to Hiragi as long as she gets her way.\nOne example of this is the way she gets Hiiragi to come to her palace; while everyone else gets transported in a very comfortable way while she makes it unpleasant for him by hooking him on a giant hook from a helicopter.",
