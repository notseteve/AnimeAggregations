  "description" : "Chimera`s appearance, masked or unmasked, is generally anomalous for her gender. She usually dons a ghastly skeletal mask with a green wig attached to it, concealing her blonde hair color (the green color is possibly exclusive to only the anime, however, as the cover of volume 13 shows a blonde-haired masked Chimera). Since her enlisting for the Chess Pieces she`s fashioned her hair spiky, a mode far more commonly styled for males, and (exclusively for the anime) builds up her stature into a more masculine form, misleading people about her actual gender. In addition to these extraordinary outward features, Chimera`s facial appearance carries hideously unique traits: she wears a grotesque mass of eyeballs on the left side of her face, stitches a horizontal black line on the scar across her nose`s bridge, and seasons the overall gruesome sight by piercing her Knight insignia earring on the tip of her tongue.\nWhen she was getting married to Marco, some villagers came and took Marco away by force since he was once part of the Chess Pieces. Though the 1st War Game was over they were insistent on finding the refugees. When Marco won`t say anything they ended up killing him and took Chimera next. After a few hellish months she managed to escape with her face looking wrong. Soon after that Peta came and persuaded her to join the Chess Pieces. She`s a Ghost ARM user.\nAfter the war game with Dorothy (in which she lost) Ian chases her due to the fact that it was her who made Gido look like a bug and lost speech. In the end her real name was revealed as Eileen. She appears to lost all hope in life, but she was carrying the marriage rings of her and Marco.",
