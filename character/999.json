  "description" : "Cacturne is a Pokémon of low metabolism that spends the day standing completely still, so that it will not lose any moisture from the scorching sun of the desert. At night, in low temperatures, Cacturne will group together and slowly follow any humans that are walking through the desert. When the fatigued human finally stops walking, the Cacturne will attack, absorbing moisture and fluids from the prey`s body. After living in the desert for several millennia, new generations of Cacturne have had their blood transformed into the same substances as sand. Cacturne are naturally immune to sandstorms, and will not be damaged by the Sandstorm attack.\nIn the anime, May`s rival Harley, who dresses like a Cacturne, has a Cacturne as his signature Pokémon, skilled at creatively using attacks like Cotton Spore, Bullet Seed and Pin Missile to both terrify and impress the audience and judges in Contests. When Harley once met with Team Rocket, his Cacturne was instantly attracted to Jessie and hugged her, accidentally sticking her with its spines.",
