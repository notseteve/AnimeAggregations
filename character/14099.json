  "description" : "Lithuania, the eldest, was once a superpower that ruled much of Eastern and Middle Europe with Poland, but their empire collapsed. He has always fought off other countries, including Russia and the Teutonic Knights (the younger version of Prussia). Lithuania is shown to be good friends with both Poland and America, having lived in the latter`s house for a while before the Great Depression. He has a crush on Belarus, not noticing when she glares at him and, one time, not even noticing when she broke all of his fingers.",
