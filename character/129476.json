After So came out and told Ash he could have some of the berries, he was about to pick them but Sae had already some gathered along with some bread she had baked. She gave them to him along with some extra for his friend.\nHer son died a year earlier. She explained to Ash what had happened when he brought back the hat her son used to wear. She would work in the city and her husband would work in his atelier, so it was rare for them to be together and the one day the were all together, Haruto was wearing that hat and they were looking up into the sky.",
