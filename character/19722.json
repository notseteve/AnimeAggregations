  "description" : "An author who writes fantasy stories (which her missing husband and son are extremely interested in), Ginta`s mother is a strong drinker and smoker, and also apparently has an interest in cooking unusual foods, once trying to make \"pizza curry\". In spite of her occupation, she stands a very practical viewpoint in matters regarding fantasied subjects, therefore tends to make light of her husband`s, and later son`s, passion for such. After Ginta`s disappearance, however, she rues this dearly, thinking it was her fault her family`s gone and as Koyuki narrates Ginta`s journey in MÃ„R-Heaven, starts seeing fantasy in a different light.",
