  "description" : "As the Princess of Heaven, Erumina is an angel who wears white robes and has wings. Erumina is very studious and fastidious, and a bit of a humorless goody-two-shoes.\nWhen she was younger, her stern father (who is the king of Heaven) would not tolerate imperfection. Erumina tries very hard to be perfect, and she is also very hard on herself whenever she makes a mistake.\nWith her new friends at the Princess Academy, Erumina slowly learns to be more confident and secure. Looks ten, but is actually seventeen as a result of the same curse.",
