  "description" : "Frederica is an omni-present being surrounding the Higurashi universe. Frederica is the writer of the poem about Rika`s struggle to escape the fate of June 1983, giving hints about each arc. She likes playing with time and events, as seen in puzzle piece #52 and the end of the second season of the anime, entering an alternate world and stopping Miyoko`s parents from dying. She even has an intention of making a world where Rika`s or Satoko`s parents did not die, or pairing Keiichi with various girls. Although she claims that she is not Rika, it`s implied that she is the collective mentality of the several thousand reincarnations of Rika. The pronunciation of \"Frederica\" roughly resembles Rika`s name in eastern order, and Bernkastel is well known for its wine.",
