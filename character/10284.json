  "description" : "Oyakata (or Boss) is a large, muscular man who terms himself a \"lingerie artist,\" but is simply called an underwear thief by most other people. He is quite knowledgeable on various brands and manufacturers of underwear and has received special training so he can remain unobserved while he goes about his `life`s path`. The Boss has on several occasions annoyed http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s Inukami by (attempting to) steal their lingerie, but he has also been instrumental in the battle to destroy the robot Xanthippe. Whenever he is seen, the Boss wears trousers, boots and lingerie; generally a pair of panties on his head and a bra on his chest. He apparently forms a team with the http://anidb.net/ch10283 [Doctor] and the http://anidb.net/ch10285 [Kakarichou].",
