  "description" : "Maaya is the leader of the underground resistance on the Illumidas-occupied Earth. As the \"Voice of Free Arcadia\", she broadcasts inspiring radio messages to her fellow Earthlings, urging them to hold on to the hope of a brighter future. Her continued defiance of the new collaborationist government of Earth makes her, at one point, the most wanted person on the planet.\nHer exact relationship with Harlock is never established, but they have known each other since their childhood in Heiligenstadt (or \"Arcadia\", as they call it), and the pirate captain would go to great lengths to ensure her safety, except when doing so would compromise their shared ideals.",
