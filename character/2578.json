  "description" : "Priscilla was promoted to Claymore #2 shortly after she joined the organisation. She was so powerful that she could fight with her Yoma power almost entirely suppressed, allowing her to conceal her presence from Yoma and fellow Claymores even in the heat of battle. According to Irene, this made her a perfect candidate for fighting Teresa, as Teresa`s greatest strength was her ability to sense Yoma energy.",
