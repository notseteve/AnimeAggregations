  "description" : "Renji`s childhood friend and also a Night Wizard. She recruited Elis to the Astronomy Club at Kimei Academy after asking her if she liked stars or not. Her artifact is a crossbow attached to her arm which, like other artifacts, has a variety of different attacks. She`s a childhood friend of Hiiragi and knows a secret of his which she often holds over his head. Despite teasing Renji often, she is very attached to Renji so she says although it isn`t apparent in the way she treats him. She also assumes the role of a controlling mum in Renji`s life, forcing him to anything on her whim.\nShe was killed by Kirihito in episode 12, but was later resurrected through the combined powers of Anzelotte and Lion Gunta in order to foil Kirihito`s summoning of Shaimal done by Elis` devastation of losing her friends. She is in love with Hiiragi.",
