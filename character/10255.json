  "description" : "Tayune is the sporty-looking, short-haired member of the pack that serves http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. Tayune is a physical person, quick to beat http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] when she feels he is being perverted towards her, quite loud and prideful. Oddly, she is apparently also deathly afraid of ghost stories and scary things. In combat, she sometimes wields a short staff as a blunt weapon. She is often teased by her fellow Inukami for being scared, and for supposedly getting romantically attached to Keita. Tayune is brutally powerful in combat, possibly second only to http://anidb.net/ch10253 [Nadeshiko] when the latter is fully empowered among Kaoru`s inukami.",
