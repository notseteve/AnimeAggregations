  "description" : "Ash`s Dracovish was restored by Fossil Researcher Bray Zenn who digs up and restores Fossil Pokémon in the Galar region`s Wild Area. He restored a Dracovish using a Fossil Restorer Machine and after getting lots of new data studying it, he allowed Ash Ketchum to catch it.\n-- Pokémon World Championships Hyper Class Battle VS Drasna --\nDrasna`s Altaria was the second Pokémon that Drasna battled with and it mainly faced off against Ash`s Dracovish. Half way through the battle, it mega evolved and as a result it`s type changed from Dragon/Flying to Dragon/Fairy but Ash Ketchum didn`t realize this and it told Dracovish to use Dragon Rush but it wasn`t very effective. Nearing defeat, Dracovish was recalled and Ash`s Sirfetch`d used Meteor Assault to knocked out Drasna`s Mega Altaria but it also was knocked out in the process. Dracovish then faced off against a weakened Noivern and the two clashed with Dragon Rush and Dragon Pulse and Ash`s Dracovish was the one left standing which gave Ash Ketchum the match victory and raised his Pokémon World Championships ranking from 15th to 9th.",
