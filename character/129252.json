It quickly defeated Ash`s Dracovish before it could even fight back. It then battled Ash`s Dragonite which was already damaged but it learned Draco Meteor during the battle and it defeated Iris` Haxorus. Iris` Axew had been shown to always want to evolve, as Iris` Haxorus appeared in a dream it had in BW 6.",
