  "description" : "The Host Club`s (self-proclaimed) manager who tends to be very loud and outspoken. She had lived in France for a short time before she came to attend Ouran. Renge first came across the Host Club by maintaining the belief she was Kyouya`s fianc√©e despite never having met him in person. This is due to her love of visual novel-type video games to a point that she sometimes confuses them with real life. Her fascination with Kyouya originated from her obsession with one such dating game (Kyouya greatly resembled the lead character). Still, her experience with dating sims causes her to be more aware of character development and a thickening plot.",
