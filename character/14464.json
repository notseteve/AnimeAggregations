  "description" : "The muscle man for the Gangreen Gang. Big Billy`s height is 7`5 tall. Unlike the original Big Billy, this incarnation appears to be capable of thought and can speak properly without having to say `duuh`. Big Billy has a bigger and stronger aunt, uncle and older brother, who wish Big Billy would work for once. Like the original, he is a cyclops, but this time his eye is actually visible through his hair. Big Billy loves to eat and will gobble more junk than the rest of the gang. He uses his size and sheer power to his advantage in battle. However, his strength pales in comparison to Buttercup`s.",
