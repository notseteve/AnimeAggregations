  "description" : "Asuma was born in Maebashi in Gunma Prefecture and is the son of the owner of Shinohara Heavy Industries, the makers of the Ingram. So why is he a public servant? Apparently his father forced him into being one. As a member of Unit 2, he provides backup for Noa`s Ingram and is her partner. He can be quite short tempered and sometimes gives the impression he would rather be somewhere else. Still he`s a competent police officer.",
