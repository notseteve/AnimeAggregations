  "description" : "The middle child of the Casull family after Pacifica was adopted, meaning he is Raquel`s younger brother and Pacifica`s older foster brother. Shannon is a skilled swordsman who has sworn to defend Pacifica`s life no matter what, but he is reserved and calm despite many difficult things transpiring in the Casull sibling`s lives. Later in the series, he merges with Zefiris to become a D-Knight. Strangely, he looks almost exactly like Zefiris` old master, Lord Beckham Mauser. In the end, Shannon manages to unlock the full power of the D-Knight and helps to retrieve Pacifica after her death, bringing her back to Earth. He later returns to his family farm with Pacifica, Raquel, and Zefiris.",
