  "description" : "The single daughter of the high school`s principal, who, on the outside, behaves well like a rich man`s polite and elegant daughter. On the inside, she is revealed to be quite sadistic and threatens Kinjirou on his greatest fear and using his gynophobia to make him suffer. She is shown to enjoy tormenting and teasing Kinjirou by using his gynophobia against him. However, she did give thoughts about finding a way to cure his gynophobia although her methods to do so are generally overly complicated or humiliate him in some way and she does not deny that she finds them amusing. She notes that Kinjirou is the first, and only, man who is willing to talk her down and she is implied to have fallen in love with him as a result. She is also implied to be a bisexual as she has claimed that Subaru was her first love.\nSource: Wikipedia",
