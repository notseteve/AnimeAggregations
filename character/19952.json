  "description" : "Colonnello is one of the seven Arcobaleno and the holder of the Rain Pacifier. He has blonde, spiky hair and wears green army camouflage. Colonnello has a tendency to add \"-kora!,\" or \"hey!,\" to the end of his sentences. He wears black army boots and a camouflage bandana around his head. He is in charge of the training ground behind Mafia Land and was a former member of the COMSUBIN, and, because of that, he is not averse to using heavy artillery, using an anti-tank rifle as his primary Weapon. He has mastered the martial arts of karate and SAMBO. Falco, the bird on top of Colonnello`s head, helps him fly to distant places. Colonnello acts as a rival towards Reborn and vice-versa, but despite this, he shares many traits with Reborn, like being a merciless tutor, suddenly taking naps (while talking a lot of the time), and having a sharp tongue.\n[rebornwikia]",
