He is also http://anidb.net/ch10768 [Mikado]`s son-in-law; he has a similar hairstyle like http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate]`s.\nIn the 3rd season, Shin had served http://anidb.net/ch10491 [Yukariko] while planning his escape with the Kurotsubaki (Black Camellia), a clock that brings bad luck but can grant the owner a life full of miracles. However, he eventually fell in love with http://anidb.net/ch10491 [Yukariko] and instead wished to be man worthy of her. Eventually, he proposed and they ended up getting married. It said that he died in a car accident at Area 51 in Nevada U.S.A. http://anidb.net/ch10768 [Mikado] reveals that Shin was a con artist who married http://anidb.net/ch10491 [Yukariko] aiming for the Sanzenin fortune.
