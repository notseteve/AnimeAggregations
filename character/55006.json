  "description" : "Sugune is a samurai boy with an old-fashioned personality and speech who has spent five years on the G Team. Due to his personality, he holds justice and his duties very strongly, and is at first baffled by Hajime, who makes him believe in things he had once not thought possible. When he first met her, he did not even think of her as a woman, but as they continued to work together, he began to understand and admire her, and even began to hold feelings of love for her.\nSource: ANN",
