  "description" : "At first glance, Eledore seems a poor choice for a soldier. Whether planning for his musical career, putting the moves on his teammate Karen, or just spacing out and listening to his Walkman, the 08th MS Team`s hovertruck operator never seems to have his mind on his work. But Eledore is all business whenever the team enters combat, and his keen musician`s ears give him an uncanny ability to pinpoint enemy forces with the hovertruck`s sonar sensors.",
