  "description" : "Suzuka`s older sister by one year. According to her younger sister, Suzune is slightly dim-witted. Early in the series, every time she meets Yamato, she has the family dog \"Muku\" attack him. She is the only character that has an easy time reading Suzuka`s thoughts. She shows up later on when Yamato walks home Suzuka from a date. She was apparently very amused when Yamato first met her parents and reveals later that unlike Yamato, her own boyfriend was not allowed into their house by her stern father because her boyfriend failed to greet Mr. Asahina properly.",
