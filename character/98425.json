  "description" : "Madarame Ichiryuusai was a famous artist and mentor to Kitagawa Yuusuke. Coming off initially as a kindly and soft-spoken old man and a great painter, in reality he has been suffering from artist`s block for many years and has been secretly abusing his students and plagiarising their works. This makes him a target for a change of heart for the Phantom Thieves.",
