  "description" : "The wealthy blonde daughter of the school`s headteacher, Sena shows a dislike of all things \"ordinary\". She is both attractive and academically successful, but her resulting arrogance leads her to be disliked by her female peers. Their admiration eludes her, much as she desires it; she treats her male classmates only as servants to be used, although many of them would like to be her boyfriend. Nonetheless, she holds http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka] to a higher standard. Kodaka concludes that she is the weirdest member of the club, as she is able to warrant weird and disgusted looks not only from http://anidb.net/ch32428 [Yozora] and http://anidb.net/ch32432 [Kobato], but also from http://anidb.net/ch32431 [Yukimura] and http://anidb.net/ch32429 [Rika].\nShe enjoys playing video games, including dating sims and eroge, partially because they allow her to make female (if virtual) friends. She is generally fascinated by the girls in these games and has also taken a liking to Kobato. Yozora calls her \"Meat\" (è‚‰ Niku - due to her large breasts?), an insulting nickname which she secretly likes because it was the first she had ever received.\nSource: Wiki",
