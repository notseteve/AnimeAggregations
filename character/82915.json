  "description" : "Miranda Lotto is a 25-year-old German woman whose clock caused time to rewind in her town after she unknowingly activated the Innocence inside it. She often feels inferior and useless, but with the help of http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen] and http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee], she became determined to be a useful Exorcist, and has become more self-confident and capable; she is still, however, a very nervous and jittery person.\nHer Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, the Time Record, is located on her right arm. It allows her to stop or reverse time in an area for a short while, causing any object to revert to its original status; however, any damage the object suffered before and during the reversed time will affect the object once the technique is stopped. She is also unable to resurrect the dead, due to the fact that her Innocence cannot erase time.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
