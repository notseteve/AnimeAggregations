  "description" : "H-01 is the replacement for Wild Tiger brought after Barnaby`s memories were manipulated. At first thought to be a person, it is in truth a cyborg created by Rotwang to destroy the Heroes, so they could be replaced by cyborgs. H-01 is shown to be a terrific battler that does not suffer from the limitations brought by Hero powers.",
