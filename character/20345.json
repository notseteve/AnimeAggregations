  "description" : "Limelda Jorg is a second lieutenant of the Gazth-Sonikan Royal Elite Guard and the most prolific sniper in the country (with the exception of Madlax). She initially enlisted after her relatives were killed by Galza.\nAs a member of the Royal Elite Guard she is assigned to protect Commander-in-Chief of the Royalist Army Guen McNichol who is assassinated by Madlax. After that and after `duel` with Madlax Limelda considers her as her rival and starts to be obsessed by her and her unbelievable talent. Later on she meets Carrossea Doon and is assigned (by himself alone) as his assistant and bodyguard - all that for only one purpose, they both want to meet Madlax (again). Despite multiple chances to kill Limelda, Madlax has always let her go and eventually shared with her the data she discovered on Enfant`s involvement with Gazth-Sonikan war. This revelation shattered Limelda`s world view and made her quit the Army and deepen her obsession in Madlax that leads to renew the attempts to kill her in a crazy hope that once she is dead, everything will return to `normal`. This strange way of thinking has its own logic covered within human Essence. At the end Limelda is asked by Madlax to `watch over her until the end` so Madlax can live within her - to become part of Limelda`s soul.",
