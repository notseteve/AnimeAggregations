  "description" : "During the military chaos wracking Earth in A.W. 0015, a band of Vultures based on the land battleship Freeden encountered a remnant of the Space Revolutionary Army in the form of the powerful RMSN-008 Bertigo mobile suit and its Newtype pilot, Caris Nautilus. Garrod Ran`s GX-9900 Gundam X was severely damaged by the Bertigo`s remote bit weapons, and it had to be overhauled and rebuilt to return to combat readiness. Its satellite cannon was damaged beyond repair and had to be scrapped, but Kid Salsamille, the Freeden`s resourceful young mobile suit mechanic, rebuilt the GX and gave it an extra beam sword, a salvaged, space battleship-grade 2-barrel beam machine gun, extra vernier thrusters, and a \"divider\" shield which not only mounted 13 linked beam guns (also called a \"beam harmonica\"), but also mounted thrusters and control surfaces to put it back into the air. Renamed the GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider, this rebuilt mobile suit would prove to be even more effective than its namesake in terms of conventional maneuverability and firepower. Initially, the GX Divider still required the G-controller unit for activation and operation; however, with the absence of the satellite cannon (and the Freeden crew`s only handy G-controller being needed to operate their newly-captured GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X), Kid soon modified the GX Divider`s cockpit panel so that it could be activated without a G-controller. With Garrod piloting his newly stolen Double X, the GX Divider was passed down to Jamil and served as his personal mobile suit throughout the rest of the military conflict in A.W. 0015.",
