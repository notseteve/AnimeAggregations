  "description" : "Ayamaro is the portly local magistrate. He is a cut-throat businessman who only desires more money and more power through whatever means necessary. The wealth he has accumulated as a powerful merchant allows him to keep the townsfolk as his subjects, to the point of him being the effective master of everything that goes on. He has enough soldiers under him to do as he pleases, including elite samurai, and a harem. He spoils his son http://anidb.net/ch3951 [Ukyou] a lot, hardly ever being strict with him in spite of Ukyou`s slowness to do any job and tendency to just do whatever comes to mind.",
