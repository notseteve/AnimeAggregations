  "description" : "Watanabe Takumi is the head (and, originally, sole member) of the school`s manga club. He has great artistic ability, but he`s only ever seen drawing stereotypical bishoujo-type characters, and his obsession tends to get a little on the creepy side. He dislikes drawing men, and it`s somewhat implied that he`s not very good at doing so. Mika-sensei has occasionally shown interest in his work.",
