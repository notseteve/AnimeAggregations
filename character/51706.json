  "description" : "As one of the world`s top perfume designers, Hiiragi Najica works with her trusty assistant Kirara to develop the Day Series perfumes for CRI Cosmetics. When not jet-setting around the world, Najica tools around neo-Tokyo in a bright red convertible. Men love her. Women want to be her. But Najica has another job, one that few ever see: Secret agent for the CRI intelligence\norganization.\nA regular James Bond in heels, Najica carries out her missions with the same professionalism that makes her an idol for her co-workers and the bane of her rivals. She is a perfectionist in everything she does, and is known for her extreme sense of confidence. She hates having anyone following her around, trying to keep up with her; thus, her reluctance to accept Lila as a partner.\nNajica`s weapon of choice is a Soviet-made Stechkin APS. With its 20-round magazine, and unique wooden holster than can be attached as a buttstock, this 50-year-old piece serves Najica well on her missions. It`s also capable of firing plastic bullets, which lessen the chance of anyone being killed or seriously injured during Najica`s confrontations.\nSource: Official Site",
