  "description" : "The black knights are saints from Index sent out to eliminate Liselotte Wreckmeister.\nAfter a seemingly losing battle with Liselotte at Ayame`s Hill 70 years ago, Avaritia, \"George of the Rainbow\", used his last resort, the forbidden technique, Contract of the Rainbow to split Liselotte`s soul and the piece of Emerald Tablet within her into seven fragments to weaken her. Liselotte with one of the fragments remains in her body was sealed within the crystal. The other fragments, due to the technique, were scattered across 6 parallel worlds.\nKakeru and the others are those fragments and are now the main threat for the Black Knights.",
