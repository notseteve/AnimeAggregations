  "description" : "It`s a mass-produced machine that was based off of Bian`s Valsion, and was produced by DC remnants. Only three of them were created. It has a Tesla Drive and Gravity Controller just like the Valsion. It`s installed with the special man-machine interface, the GEIM System, by Adler Koch. The GEIM System enhances all of its pilots senses, including the ability to process data. The GEIM System may take over its pilots will though, and it did to two of them.",
