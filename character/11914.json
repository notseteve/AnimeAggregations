  "description" : "The captain of the International Postal ship Zanbani, she always wears a crop top with diaphanous sleeves and usually ties her hair in a ponytail with a yellow ribbon. She also wears glasses, which she at one point blames on age, and is tall. She is described as being the \"sweet, raven haired beauty with glasses\" by Ahm despite the fact that she usually makes the off-hand comment that he is ugly, fat, or both. She`s strong willed, independent and usually ends up spending her spare money on weapons and ammo. Half of the time she seems to be drinking and smoking. In disciplining her crew, she has been known to slap them depending on how stupid she thinks their actions were. Although she may have a tough exterior, she does occasionally have a soft spot for her crew.",
