  "description" : "A leading member of the Red Tails. Chiaki rarely speaks and dispatches her enemies swiftly with a pair of modified air-guns hidden under her skirt. She is very loyal to Kunieda even after she leaves the gang, and is ready to shoot anyone other than Oga who makes advances on her. She is the first to recognise that Kunieda is in love with Oga and thinks it very cute, as opposed to Nene.",
