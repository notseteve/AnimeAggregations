  "description" : "Christie helped Officer Jenny (Isshu) try to figure out what was happening to the Tabunne. While they were tracking a Tabunne in a foggy forest, Christie mistakenly thought that Ash and his friends might be related to the incidents when they saw them trying to talk to the staggering Tabunne. Christie quickly apologized for mistaking them as criminals.\nShe explained that he wanted to help Officer Jenny (Isshu) investigate the Tabunne incidents because a Tabunne she is good friends with disappeared. She vowed that she and her Gothita would find the culprit no matter what. She had a bit of a rivalry going on with Doyle as they both wanted to impress Officer Jenny (Isshu).\nPer Officer Jenny (Isshu), Christie went to visit Mimi and her Tabunne to attach a tracking chip to its body while Iris came along with Christie. Christie believed that an evil organization wanted the Tabunne and that a Psychic type Pok√©mon was involved and controlling the Tabunne.\nChristie relies on her Gothita`s Telekinesis for attacking as well as for strategic movements. When they were tracking the Tabunne, she told her Gothita to use Telekinesis to lift everyone over the gorge after the Tabunne wrecked the bridge so that they couldn`t get across.\nAfter helping Ash and his friends defeat Team Rocket and rescue the Tabunne she was friends with, she was eager to ask Officer Jenny (Isshu) if her Gothita was the most helpful to show up Doyle and Doyle`s Solosis but Officer Jenny (Isshu) told her that Ash`s Roggenrola contributed the most. With a lighthearted laugh, she accepted her judgement respectfully.",
