  "description" : "Marshtomp is the mudskipper-like evolved form of Mudkip. The surface of Marshtomp`s body is enveloped by a thin, sticky film that enables it to live on land. Because it weakens if its skin dries out, it replenishes fluids by playing in mud. Its hindquarters exhibit development, giving it the ability to walk on just its hind legs. Like Mudkip, it can use the fin on its head to navigate.\nIn the Pok√©mon anime, Brock has a Marshtomp that evolved from a Mudkip he caught that is currently at his hometown in Pewter City.",
