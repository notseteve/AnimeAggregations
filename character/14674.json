  "description" : "Karehaan is the first of the Dark Fall to attack Earth; he was sent to capture Flappy and Choppy and force them to tell him where the Fountain of Sun is. When they refused to reply, he began to harm them until Saki and Mai stepped in and transformed for the first time. Karehaan transforms plants into Uzainaa monsters; he appears plant-like himself. His name comes from the word \"kareha\" which is Japanese for \"dead leaves\". This holds true since his true form is a dead leaf.",
