  "description" : "The daughter of a Baron, she grew up in a house with a father who had no lover for her; he only saw her as a tool for political advancement through marriage. This became obvious when, at the age of 15, she had been burned in a fire that killed her mother, her father, disgusted by the wound and the subsequent scarring caused by it, expelled her from the house. She found work as a maid in the Claes house. The Claes` are a distant relative house. Once Catarina recovered her former life memories and changed, Anne became devoted to her. When Anne`s father later tried to palm her off on some \"noble\", Catarina intervened and gave Anne the courage to tell her father off.",
