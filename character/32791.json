  "description" : "Klaud Nine is the only female General. Formerly an animal trainer in a circus, she seems to be a kind and gentle woman, as she is seen weeping for Sol Galen, Tina Spark, and Gwen Frere who were killed searching for her. She has long blond hair, and a scar on the right side of her face. She is later the General in charge of http://anidb.net/ch82893 [Timothy Hearst].\nLau Shimin, her Parasite-type anti-Akuma weapon, takes the form of a little monkey, usually seen riding on her shoulder. It is the first sentient Innocence shown in the series. When invoked, it transforms into a monster that attacks with balls of energy that form at its fists. It is also able to attack in long distances.",
