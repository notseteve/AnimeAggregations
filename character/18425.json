  "description" : "Ciel`s mother was patient and kind, with an elegant kind of poise occasionally shattered by her propensity to tease her younger sister into being more self-confident. She cared deeply for Angelina and took care of her after her accident. Everything points to her having been a good wife and loving mother, though as with her husband, not much is known about her, though her face is visible in flashbacks.",
