  "description" : "Despite his feminine appearance, he is in fact an androgynous okama boy who crossdresses like a girl. He himself says he does this because the female school uniform suits him better and does make him popular among male students. Also, he has the desire to date Yuuma himself, but Yuuma being entirely heterosexual strongly refuses. He often says or does things that would be seen as ironic, such as saying how perverted men are, when he himself is male. Jun`s signature attack, the Patriot Missile Kick, is a flying side kick, normally used as a means to keep Hachi under control.",
