  "description" : "Stakataka is composed of dark-gray, square stone lifeforms stacked together to form a four-sided tower with a spindly leg extending from each corner. According to Phyco, a single Stakataka consists of 150 of these lifeforms. Each stone square has a black underside with a circular blue eye located in the center. Its eyes turn red whenever it is angered or faces off against others. The lighter gray stone squares have blue lines on their sides. When at rest, the darker gray squares that form Stakataka`s legs fit into the corners of the structure. As seen in the anime, Stakataka hates having anything on top of itself and will violently try to shake the object off. However, if someone can resist the shaking and successfully ride Stakataka, then it will calm down and develop respect for that person.",
