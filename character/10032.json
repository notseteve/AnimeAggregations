  "description" : "Zeniba is Yubaba`s older twin sister and rival. Although identical in appearance, their personalities are almost polar opposites. At first she appears no kinder than Yubaba when she becomes enraged at Haku for stealing her magic seal and threatens to take it back, regardless of what happens to Haku. Hoping to gain Zeniba`s forgiveness, Chihiro journeys to Zeniba`s cottage to return it and apologize. It is then that Zeniba reveals her true character as that of a kind, grandmotherly figure. She forgives Haku for stealing her seal and tells him to look after Chihiro. She then sees everyone off, assuring Chihiro that she will be well.",
