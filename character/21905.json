  "description" : "Ungaikyou, also known as the Purple Mirror, is a youkai that resembles a huge flaming skull attached to a tiny lion-like body. It rides a bicycle and is able to travel via mirrors, trapping its victims in the same manner. If you look into its mirror, you will be killed on your thirteenth birthday.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch15459 [Kana] first encountered it when she was 6 years old, when she and some other children found and looked into a purple mirror. The rest of the children turned up missing (and eventually dead) after they started middle school. It reappears on Kana`s 13th birthday with the intent to kill her but is stopped by http://anidb.net/ch17492 [\"Night\" Rikuo].\nSource: Wikipedia",
