  "description" : "Tokagerou is a 600 year old spirit from the same time as Amidamaru. He was a thief who was eventually killed by Amidamaru and because he wanted revenge he was not able to pass on. Because of his hatred he eventually turned his skin lizard green. During his life time he became infamous and even gained his own fighting style called Tokage Kenpo (Lizard Style). He always calls himself a nasty villain but is in reality a big softie who only misses the comfort of a mother`s care.",
