  "description" : "This improved version of the Hizack was developed independently by the Titans. Its armour is reinforced with Gundarium alloy, vulnerable power cables have been relocated internally, and new verniers and stabilizers give it a modest performance boost. When equipped with a long-range beam launcher, the Hizack Custom serves as a capable sniper unit.",
