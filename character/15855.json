  "description" : "Accompanying Mio as her personal bodyguard, Yamada is a telepath that once did for a private job management security company what Hotaru does for B.A.B.E.L.â€”basically detecting and repelling trouble. It is not that out of the question that Yamada was probably prosecuting a security operation in which he was injured and is now Mio`s personal bodyguard to repay Mio having nursed him back to health. Yamada`s downfall comes about when Sakaki psychometrically detects his back story and thus cleverly takes advantage of Yamada`s disorganized thought processes along with his martial arts ability to use adversarial momentum and inertia to his advantage ultimately proving a match for Yamada`s reliance upon brute force.",
