  "description" : "Taiga is an English teacher at Shirou`s school, homeroom instructor of Shirou`s class and the supervising teacher for the Archery Dojo. She is widely called \"Tiger\", a nickname she dislikes (\"Taiga\" and \"Tiger\" sound similar in Japanese), though Shirou refers to her as \"Fuji-nee\" (older sister Fuji). After Kiritsugu died, Taiga became Shirou`s guardian and has been living with him for several years. Taiga and Shirou are very close, and she regards him as a younger brother.\nTaiga is largely a comic relief character; she is irresponsible, clumsy, and prone to sporadic bouts of extreme lethargy or zest. She lives with Shirou under the pretences of being his caretaker, although she cannot cook and lacks many other domestic skills, relying on Shirou to maintain her welfare. Shirou, however, appreciates Taiga`s company, and is more than happy to care for her. When Shirou is in any need of advice, Taiga can be depended on to be a confidante for his worries.",
