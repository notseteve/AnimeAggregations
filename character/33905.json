Éclair is the beautiful and shrewd heir to the France-based Grand Tonnerre Group, which in the anime employs Tamaki`s mother as a servant in Éclair`s house. Having heard a great deal about Tamaki from his mother, Éclair develops a crush on him and Tamaki`s grandmother, who detests his mother, concocts a scheme to make him Éclair`s husband. She tracks down Tamaki in Japan and convinces him to leave the Host Club, offering him a chance to see his mother if he complies with her wishes. She secures noninterference from the Ootori group by arranging for the Grand Tonnerre Group to buy Ootori Medical so as to control Kyoya`s father.",
