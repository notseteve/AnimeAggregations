  "description" : "Usually referred to as Takano-sensei, he is a world famous photographer known also as the \"great master\". Takano, who also happens to have quite a few connections with the Kingdom of Sphere, was the only person approved by Feena`s father to document her studies on Earth, just as he had done with her mother and grandmother. He also has the unique ability to pop up out of almost anywhere without being noticed, which makes getting the photographs he needs quite easy. Takano has an assistant that follows him around, helping him develop photos or to function as a quick getaway. He`s a bit of a pervert and always seem to appear at the most embarrassing of times.",
