  "description" : "Bronzor resembles a circular mirror with two yellow eyes in the center. Bronzor have no gender. Small spherical knobs line its perimeter in a hexagonal formation, also making it look like a tambourine. It also looks like a clock, as said in the Pokémon Handbook by Scholastic. It also has a tree-like pattern on its back, which can only be seen when it is caught and sent out in battle or when the player looks at Bronzor`s gender difference page in the Pokedex (obtained at a certain point in the game) after meeting one. This design resembles ancient bronze mirrors from East Asia. The creature was introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, where they can be found at Mt. Coronet, Wayward Cave, and Route 206. Both Bronzor and its evolution have poor Speed, Attack, and Special Attack, but extremely high Defense and Special Defense.",
