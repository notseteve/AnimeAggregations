  "description" : "Santera has a powerful ability even though she is just a child, she emits a powder that burns whoever comes into contact with it. Her true form was released by a Mibu serum in the battle with Akari, a beautiful butterfly woman who was able to burn anything in her path. Because of her powder, she could not have a relationship with anyone in her life, so Nobunaga adopted her as one of his Juunishinshou. After she had a fight with Akari, she and Akari became firm friends. She left the Mibu Clan along with Antera because she had someone she could call \"friend\" in her heart.",
