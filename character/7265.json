  "description" : "Kentarou begins the story as grade-school-aged brat, generally seen trying to get between his mother and her bottle. Initially, he is antagonistic towards Yuusaku, but events soon see him to look upon Yuusaku as an \"alright guy\". He is also very fond of Kyouko, especially because he sees her as the only sane person in the building other than himself. He develops a crush on Kyouko`s niece Ikuko, reminding Yuusaku of himself, although Kentarou resents the comparison.",
