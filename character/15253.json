  "description" : "The Vice President of the Student Council, he tries to help Misaki where he can, and enjoys office routine. At first, he, like the rest of the student council, is fearful of Misaki, but he eventually comes to be on fairly close terms with both her and Usui. Yukimura is hard-working, earnest, and capable of doing most administrative work, but is not athletic in the least, especially in comparison to Misaki and Usui. His gentle, almost feminine demeanour and slight stature make him appear somewhat weak, a fact he is sensitive about, even lamenting his lack of strength for his inability to be more helpful to Misaki. He`s both terrified and in awe of Usui, after Usui kisses him as a \"reward for his hardwork\" (which, unbeknownst to all, Usui only did to make light of kissing Misaki, after noticing that she was visibly upset and incredibly jumpy around him). Yukimura has a seven-year-old sister named Rui.",
