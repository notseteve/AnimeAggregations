  "description" : "The Master of Rider and future Lord El-Melloi II, Waver steals his teacher`s artifact early on and uses it to summon Rider. He plans to use the Grail to force the Magus Association to recognize his genius. Despite his difficulties with Rider`s overbearing nature, Waver and his Servant form a strong relationship. Though lacking in practical experience in the field, Waver, mostly in part due to his Servant, survives with Holy Grail War with little detriment to himself and develops a greater sense of perspective of the world.\nSource: Wikipedia",
