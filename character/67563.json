  "description" : "Millefeui`s Slurpuff was first seen when it ate the Pofflé that Serena had made. It thought her Pofflé was so-so. Peroream can pick up sweet scents, so it`s good at finding Berries. It was instrumental in helping Millefeui find some berries for the final round of the Pofflés Contest.\nSince Peroream is the evolved form of Peroppuff, it could understand the feelings of the Peroppuff very well that were angry after Rocket Gang had disrupted their food source.",
