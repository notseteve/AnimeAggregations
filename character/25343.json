  "description" : "Necessarius is the secret magical branch of the Church of England. Officially named the Church of Necessary Evil, the organization was started by Puritans who despise the use of magic in England and sought to destroy it by using magic themselves but now the organization no longer has an anti-magic stance and supports magic. Officially, Necessarius is under the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury but the current leader and Archbishop of Necessarius secretly controls the Archbishop of Canterbury thus Necessarius is the true power behind the Anglican Church. As one of the three magic powers of Britain, Necessarius represent the religious magic community. Necessarius is currently led by Archbishop Laura Stuart.",
