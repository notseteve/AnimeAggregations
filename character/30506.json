  "description" : "Aaron`s Pidgeot was used by Aaron to quickly transport him to places that would normally take people in ancient times a while to get to. It picked Aaron up at Aldoran Castle and took it to Aaron`s Lucario who was out on the battlefield. Aaron`s Pidgeot returned his staff containing Aaron`s Lucario to Rin and then transported him to the Tree of World`s Origin. A painting of Aaron riding his Pidgeot is displayed in the main hall of Aldoran Castle in the present day.",
