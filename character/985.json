  "description" : "Carvanha`s name originates from the words \"carve\" and \"piranha\". Its Japanese name is a portmanteau of ç‰™ (kiba), fang, and the English word \"piranha\". Another possible origin is \"carnivore\" which means meat or flesh eater. Referring to its evolution, Sharpedo, the name Carcharias (a genus of sharks) is possibly an influence to carvanha`s name.",
