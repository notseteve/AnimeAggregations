  "description" : "The Nines are a special forces unit directly controlled by http://anidb.net/ch96294 [APE]. They also assume the role of \"secret police\", operating directly under http://anidb.net/ch93324 [Papa] and carrying out his commands, maintaining order within plantations. They are unbound by any restrictions, including the exempt on 13th Plantation, http://anidb.net/ch96297 [Cerasus].\nIn reality, they are clones created from http://anidb.net/ch92214 [Zero Two]`s cells, although they lack the Klaxosaur blood.\nSource: Darling in the Franxx Wiki",
