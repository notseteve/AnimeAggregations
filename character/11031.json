It`s equipped with three mega particle cannon turrets and a battery of missile launchers, and its main deck can store three Zakus. The Komusai capsule stored in the Musai`s prow can be used as an atmospheric re-entry shuttle, with space for two more mobile suits. Char Aznable commands a modified Musai with a distinctive helmet-shaped bridge.",
