  "description" : "Lancer of Black is http://anidb.net/ch89993 [Darnic Prestone Yggdmillennia]`s servant and leader of the Servants of Black.\n[spoiler=\"True Name and Noble Phantasm\"]His true name is Vlad III, the Lord Impaler, the greatest hero of Wallachia, whose feats in war caused him to be known fearsomely as the Impaling Prince to the Turks. Due to the legends associated with him, another name has been spread across the world, The Little Dragon, better known as the vampire Count Dracula. While the nation was small, he was a hero who ascended to the throne and managed to turn back the numerous invasions of the Ottoman Empire that had trampled over every other country. Though the model for Dracula, he was not a vampire, but a man of devotion and great hero.\nIn anime, he despises the Dracula myth as he sees it as a corruption of his efforts in life to save his country and people. His Noble Phantasm is Lord of Execution, allowing him to summon thousands of stakes on which he can impale his enemies.[/spoiler]\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
