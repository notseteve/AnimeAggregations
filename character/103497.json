  "description" : "Ten years ago, Ganryū and his team were sent on a mission to retrieve a document taken by Kumogakure, with the assistance of Iwagakure. However, when the document was retrieved, the Iwa shinobi betrayed the Kiri team and killed Junsai and Suiren, the latter sacrificing herself to save Ganryū. This incident would become known as the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass which began the hostilities between the two nations. Since that day, Ganryū has held a deep hatred against Iwagakure.",
