  "description" : "* Ability: Turn her plans into reality\nShe uses her power with Putting`s to make a combination attack. This, however, was taken out temporarily by Hideyoshi blocking her sketch pad with one of his portraits, and the loss of Pudding earlier so she has no materials. In her fight with Ai, Memory is forced to fall back on hand-to-hand combat. She is the first \"victim\" of Mori`s power. A very competent field leader who acts as a spotter from higher ground.\nShe is also the smartest and the strictest of the team.",
