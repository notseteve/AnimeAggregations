  "description" : "Flora`s Gothorita participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament. It faced Cilan`s Pansage in the first round. Initially Flora`s Gothorita did well in the battle but Cilan had been studying its initial moves and he went into his Tasting Time and explained that while it was an honors student with perfect marks in speed and technique, it wasn`t as strong as it appeared. Cilan figured out how to counter Flora`s Gothorita and Cilan`s Pansage finished it with a Dig attack. Cilan defeated Flora and eliminated her from the tournament while noting that it was a relatively easy battle for the first round.",
