  "description" : "Steven Stone`s Cradily was the second Pok√©mon he used during his Masters Tournament first round battle against Ash Ketchum. It was swapped out to face Ash`s Dracovish who was proving to be a difficult matchup for Steven Stone`s Metagross. It defeated Dracovish and Ash`s Gengar. Pikachu used its Electroweb to keep its vines tangled up and then ran down them to finish it off with an Iron Tail.",
