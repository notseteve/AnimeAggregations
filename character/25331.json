  "description" : "Fukiyose Seiri is Touma`s classmate, Aisa`s best friend, often takes up roles of the class representative even though it`s Aogami`s the class representative. She dislikes people (namely Touma) who give up on their life and blame it on bad luck. It`s debatable if she is tsundere towards Touma or only dislikes him because of his attitude towards life and school in general but for sure she does have a sort of friendly relationship with him, even sometimes playing a role of tsukkomi for Touma who acts as the boke. She is mentioned as the girl who is \"pretty but lacks sex appeal\". She is a health-product freak and is frequently ordering different health products from the television shopping channels.",
