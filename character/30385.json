  "description" : "The female protagonist of the story, Konoe is a second year high school student who works as a butler for the Suzutsuki family and suffers from aichmophobia. When she was young she was noted to be antisocial and was not close to anyone which worried her mother. She dresses like a male due to the family circumstance of a requirement to have a male from her family serve Kanade`s family. Because of her being the only child, she has to cross-dress and Kanade`s father only allowed her to be Kanade`s butler if she could spend the entire 3 years at school with her true gender undiscovered. Due to her physical features she is believed by everyone to be a boy until one day, Kinjirou accidentally discovers her secret. She is very bad at naming things, such as fighting moves, and is aware of it but nevertheless, despite her petite figure, is shown to be a very strong fighter. Although she initially hated Kinjirou, both because he discovered her secret and for being a \"pervert\", she quickly warms up to and becomes friends with him - even developing romantic feelings for him as well as becoming less cold and more outgoing. Her father also noted that she started looking forward to going to school. Like Kinjirou, she enjoys instant noodles and is also a fan of the popular \"Lost Sheep\" series of plush dolls.\nSource: Wikipedia",
