However, out of the four people that can make barriers, his ability is the weakest. He is a water user and has a water mirror that allows the user to see things happening far away. He can also use this mirror to communicate with fellow water user, Tenkou. Genbu is often seen with Taiin who he constantly berates on some of the things she does.\nSource: Wiki",
