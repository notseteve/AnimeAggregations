  "description" : "Nara Shikaku is the father of http://anidb.net/ch8615 [Nara Shikamaru] and the husband of Nara Yoshino. He is the Jounin Commander of Konoha. He greatly resembles his son, with the exception of his more matured appearance and the few scars on his face. He was also a member of an Ino-Shika-Cho trio.\nWhen he was first seen, he was portrayed as a bit of an alcoholic, and, at times, uses some of Shikamaru`s catchphrases (\"What a drag\" in English and \"How troublesome\" in Japanese). Like his son, he thinks that women should be tender and sweet, but, as his son says, his wife has him \"whipped\". Also like his son, he is a very intelligent but lazy person, yet he is also quite caring, and is ready to jump into action when needed. Unlike his son, his resolve is much stronger, as even during the most depressing or dangerous of situations, he has been shown to maintain great determination and understanding, as shown from how he has repeatedly helped Shikamaru regain his sense of worth. In battle, Shikaku appears merciless. He had no qualms about choking the Suna shinobi to death, even when one of them was clearly cowering.\nSince Shikamaru became a Chuunin, Shikaku has taken a great interest in his training, teaching him the clan`s more secret techniques and having great confidence in Shikamaru`s abilities. He also spends his time tending to the clan`s deer.",
