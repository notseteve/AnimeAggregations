  "description" : "Takashimadaira Rei is a veteran animation producer who has worked with Studio Petit in the past. He has a reputation as a fearsome taskmaster, willing to sacrifice quality to meet the schedule. This is not something that goes down well with Kuromi-chan or Shihonmatsu ...\nOn a separate note, his walking style would probably get him a small grant from the Ministry of Silly Walks.\nIt was his no-direction approach on Louise Monde III that led Shihonmatsu to walk out and almost quit the animation industry.",
