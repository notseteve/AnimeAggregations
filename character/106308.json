  "description" : "Catarina Claes is the \"heroine\" of this story. She was reincarnated into an otome game she played extensively in her past life (one of the last things she did before being killed by a truck), but as the villainess! Now, she has to do what she can to prevent been exiled, or killed. She is considered to be \"dense\" because nearly all of her efforts and thoughts are so geared towards preventing any bad endings that she becomes oblivious to the harem that forms around her, both male and female. Because of having recovered her past life memories, she becomes a totally different person from the \"real\" Catarina, but she doesn`t even realize that, which makes her a bit obsessive about not tripping any \"danger flags\".",
