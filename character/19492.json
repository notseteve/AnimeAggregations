  "description" : "Fuyuki Ikuo is the supervisor of the 2nd city affairs department in the city hall, and as such the superior of http://anidb.net/ch19484 [Marufuji Izumi], http://anidb.net/ch19485 [Minegishi Kaoruko] and http://anidb.net/ch19486 [Takase Yuuki]. Ikuo is a good-looking, respectable, kind and charming person (and thus well liked by his subordinates). He loves sweet food, especially ice cream; he shows interest in the http://anidb.net/ch9745 [unnamed protagonist]`s story as he has already heard about the rumors of shadow creatures recently appearing in the town.\nBut all of this is just a fake vita allowing him to hide the secret that`s buried inside the city hall. Actually Ikuo is the older brother of the unnamed protagonist, the husband of http://anidb.net/ch19483 [Saegusa Miyako] (two facts that were deleted from the protagonist`s memory) and more importantly, he`s the creator and supervisor of the http://anidb.net/ch39798 [Pandora Project].",
