  "description" : "Molayne`s Ampharos was lent to Sophocles as he wanted to work on the Fiarrow2 (ファイアロー２) probe project at the Mossdeep Space Center in the Hoenn region. It is quite clumsy with its tail and hits objects and things with it and it causes it to lose its balance and fall a lot. Goh`s Grookey took a liking to its tail though, especially because it can light up. Ampharos entered a special chamber at the Space Center which was used to amplify and create a beacon light for the probe to be directed to burn up in the atmosphere.",
