  "description" : "Kamizuki Izumo is a Chuunin from http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konohagakure]. He spends most of the time with his partner, http://anidb.net/ch10329 [Hagane Kotetsu]. Izumo is almost always seen alongside Kotetsu, and is characterized as being the more responsible and conscientious of the two. In Shippuuden Episode 81, he angrily burst into the Jounin lounge to drag his partner back to work. Similarly, in another omake, he admonished Kotetsu`s lack of pride in his work when the latter complained that they were simply the http://anidb.net/ch8606 [Fifth Hokage]`s errand-boys or \"gophers\", before adding sagely that guarding the Leaf and the villagers was \"the best mission you can get\" as a shinobi.",
