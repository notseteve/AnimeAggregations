  "description" : "This command mobile suit is used exclusively by http://anidb.net/ch1738 [Crossbone Vanguard] squadron leaders like Zabine Chareux of the elite http://anidb.net/ch1763 [Black Vanguard] force. Based on the http://anidb.net/ch1758 [Berga Dalas], this newer model features improved sensor and thruster systems, and an extra pair of shelf nozzles are attached to its backpack. While its armament is essentially identical to that of its predecessor, the Berga Giros is equipped with a hand-held shot lancer that can be put aside during combat, unlike the fixed version used by the http://anidb.net/ch1758 [Berga Dalas].",
