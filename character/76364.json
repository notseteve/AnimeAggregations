  "description" : "One of several \"Gundam\" frames which fought in the CALAMITY WAR three centuries prior, this suit has long since been retired to use as a generator by CGS. During the raid by Gjallarhorn, the boys of CGS hastily press it back into service, piloted by Mikazuki. Long years of poor maintenance since the CALAMITY WAR have left it with weakened armor and unable to operate at its full potential.\nSource: en.gundam.info",
