  "description" : "Bel Peol is one of the Trinity of the Bal Masqu√©, entitled as the \"Strategist\". She takes the form of a woman with three eyes, but has an eye-patch covering her right eye. A scheming character that would have no qualms in manipulating her unsuspecting subordinates and sending them off to die. Apparently she also has a gift for engendering loyalty in her subordinates, such as Vine, as she is capable of inspiring them to perform obviously dangerous tasks on her behalf. Her strategic skills are balanced by a considerable aptitude for combat.\nIn the novel, Bel Peol`s catchphrase is \"Much things in life don`t come as one pleases\". Unlike most Denizens, who live their lives as they will, Bel Peol is exceptional in that fact that she enjoys the obstacles that come against her plans, delighting in the challenges they pose, feeling that it is the overcoming of such obstacles that makes life interesting.",
