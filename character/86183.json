  "description" : "Tanya von Degurechaff is a young blonde, blue-eyed girl who is the reincarnation of a cold-hearted, atheist and social-darwinistic Japanese salaryman. Born as Tanya Degurechaff, she joined the military while still a child, quickly rose through the ranks, and was granted the title of von after graduating from the War College as one of the Twelve Knights. She is a mage with magical powers that enable her to fly and fire explosive bullets. Compared to others, Tanya has a high latent magical ability, and is the only one capable of using an experimental Type-95 jewel due to God or Being X`s interference.\nTanya is quite ruthless and intolerant of failings in others, much the same as in her previous life, and employs several extreme punishments and training methods. During most of the series, her rank is Major. She controls a battalion of elite mages whose main purpose is to overwhelm enemy forces while also remaining highly mobile and relatively small.\nBy the end of the movie, she is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given control of the Salamander Kampfgruppe, an experimental unit with her battalion at its heart.\nSource: Wikipedia",
