  "description" : "Olu`olu-kun is a Pokébase player who is currently busy playing the game in the pro league as a member of the Koikings team. He hit a come-from-behind out-of-the-park walk-off home run to be the champions of the first half of the season. He was born on Melemele Island in the Alola Region.\nAt the request of Samson Oak and Professor Kukui, he was a special coach one day at the Pokémon School where he used to attend as a student. He was told there were some students at the school who were interested in Pokébase and he had a spare moment one day to teach them about the game. He played a couple rounds with them and was instrumental in beating Team Rocket in the second match.\nJessie was a very sensible hunk and wanted his autograph. She didn`t know anything about Pokébase but was just infatuated with his good looks. Oluolu agreed to give her an autograph if they beat the Pokémon School Pokébase. In the end, they lost that match but Oluolu gave her an autograph as a thank you for a nice game.",
