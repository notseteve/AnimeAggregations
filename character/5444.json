As the one who ordered the assassination of Luna, he was the true cause of the world`s destruction. Dismissing the rumours of the effects of devouring Casshern, he spends his time following him from afar, watching his actions.\nAt the end of the anime, he and his army found salvation from Luna. As Casshern returned, destroying his army, he fought 1 on 1 with Casshern, and only ended up losing. His last words were about killing Luna to \"atone\" for his sins he regretted that he did on the world.",
