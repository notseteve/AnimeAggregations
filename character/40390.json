  "description" : "Stephan`s Zebstrika was revealed at the registration for the Don Battle Tournament in Raimon Town. Stephan was riding it when he met Ash and his friends. Stephan`s Blitzle evolved into Stephan`s Zebstrika as Stephan confirmed to Ash that it had evolved during the time between BW41 and their last meeting in BW31.\nIn the first round of the Don George Tournament, Stephan`s Zebstrika was matched up against Bianca`s Minccino. Bianca`s Minccino used Tickle to be a battle distraction but Stephan`s Zebstrika was able to compose itself and defeat it with a strong Stomp. Stephan`s Zebstrika`s win advanced Stephan into the second round of the tournament.",
