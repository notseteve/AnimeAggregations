  "description" : "Politoed, a frog Pokémon, is an alternate evolution of Poliwhirl that is obtained by trading it to another player with a King`s Rock. Politoed has green skin which turns yellow at its paws, lower jaw and belly. Its belly is adorned with a green spiral mark, similar to its pre-evolutionary forms. On top of its head grows a long blue hair that is curled in a manner similar to the spiral. Politoed dominates over its related species. When Poliwags and Poliwhirls hear its cry, they come running to its side from far and wide. Its status is displayed in the form of its single blue curly hair, which is an object of reverence among its \"subjects.\" The longer and more curled the hair, the better respected the Politoed who supports it.\nIn the anime, Politoed is one of the Pokémon used by Misty. She obtained it when her Poliwhirl was withdrawn in its Poké Ball while holding the King`s Rock Ash had previously won as a Pokémon sumo tournament prize. Misty`s Politoed is strong and cheerful. It is frequently seen joyfully dancing around.",
