  "description" : "Lana`s Primarina is the evolved form of Lana`s Brionne. It evolved when swimming after Kyogre to rescue Lana.\nIt battled against Mallow`s Tsareena in the Top 16 round of the Alola League. Mallow was going to give in as she didn`t want Tsareena to keep fighting a losing battle. It didn`t want to quit and it convinced her to keep on fighting and they performed the Z-Move Bloom Doom for the first time. Lana`s Primarina countered with the Oceanic Operetta Z-Move and they ended up cancelling each other out. Primarina ended up winning the match.\nIn the Alola Pokémon League quarterfinals fourth match, Guzma`s Golisopod battled against Lana`s Primarina. Lana was concerned about the move First Impression as it had caught Ash Ketchum off-guard during his battle with Guzma at the Pokémon School. Guzma chose not to use that move and used Throat Chop to make Primarina`s voice bad. Golisopod controlled the battle from the start to finish and it cut the Oceanic Operetta Z-Move attack in half with its Liquidation to knock out Primarina.",
