  "description" : "Rhyperior, known as the Drill Pokémon, is the evolved form of Rhydon, a Pokémon from Generation I. It appears in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It stands completely upright, and its color has changed from gray to black with burnt orange plates, formed by a type of biological \"fusion\" with the Protector item, needed for Rhydon to evolve. Its second horn grew out from a Rhydon having the main horn pointed forward. The female`s upper horn is smaller. In addition to its extra armor, it has developed an Ankylosaur-like tail, and holes in the palms of its hands, which it uses to fire rocks at enemies, thus why it learns the move Rock Wrecker. According to the Pokédex, it sometimes accidentally fires Geodude instead of rocks.",
