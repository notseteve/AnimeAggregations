  "description" : "The queen of Havonia, Maria`s mother and Lashara`s aunt. While she may appear polite and modest at first glance, she is in reality a hedonistic woman. She develops a crush on Kenshi after the massage that was given to her by Maria and Lashara. She is also shown to be a great pilot when she tested Wahanly`s Kikkoujin in the forest. She later defends the Holy Land in the invasion plotted by Babalun in a train equipped with two cannons in each car and a giant cannon hidden in the engine. She had no idea that Kenshi was a Seikishi. When she found out, it only increased her love for him, even more as to have some \"one on one\" time with him to Lashara`s and Maria`s dismay.\nSource: Wiki",
