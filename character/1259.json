  "description" : "Glaceon, known as the Fresh Snow Pok√©mon, is one of two evolutions of Eevee that is obtained from training it in a certain location, the other evolution being Leafeon. The location necessary to evolve Eevee into Glaceon is on route 217 in the Sinnoh region. There is an ice covered rock here, but it is also possible to level up anywhere in grass on route 217 to evolve. Being an ice-type, it prefers cold climates, and as a protective measure it freezes its fur completely. This freezing causes the hair to resemble \"ice needles.\"\nIn the Anime, May`s Eevee evolved into a Glaceon prior to her reappearance in the episode 544 `Restaurant Seven Stars! Tag Battle for a Full Course!` and Bianca got a same Eevee and now evolved into Glaceon nicknamed Iceshocker.",
