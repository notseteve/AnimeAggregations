  "description" : "Fukuzawa Yumi is the main character of the series. In the beginning of the series, Yumi is bashful beyond words, very timid and unsure of herself. She first met http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Sachiko], the star of Lillian School and had her tie fixed by Sachiko, which mortified Yumi. Yumi`s friend, http://anidb.net/ch27888 [Takeshima Tsutaka], took a cute picture of this and wanted to display it in the school festival. Tsutako got Yumi to ask permission from Sachiko. Other characters often comment on how her emotions `show on her face`.\nSource: Wikipedia",
