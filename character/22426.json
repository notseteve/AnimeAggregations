  "description" : "The mother of Tarou.\nFive years ago, when Tarou was three years old, the family went on a trip around the world. As they were flying a helicopter over the Safari Land, Tarou`s Father held Tarou out of the window to give him a closer view at the Pokémon below, but ended up dropping him. Tarou`s Mother told him not to hold him out the window and Tarou`s Father ended up blaming her that she should have been holding him. Obviously, Tarou`s Mother was very mad with Tarou`s Father. Ever since, Tarou parents had been searching for Tarou without luck, until someone sent them a photo of a boy resembling Tarou living with a herd of Kangaskhan in the Safari Land Pokémon reserve. Along with her husband, she traveled to the Safari Land to retrieve her son and enlisted the help of the ranger Officer Jenny and Ash Ketchum. They soon discovered Tarou but he had already forgotten his birth parents and lived as a part of the Kangaskhan herd. While Tarou eventually regained the memory if his parents, he was too connected to his adoptive Kangaskhan family to want to go home with them. Soon afterwards, Tarou, Ash Ketchum and the others were attacked by Team Rocket, who attempted to poach Kangaskhan using a giant Kangaskhan robot, and together with her husband, she sacrificed herself by running their helicopter straight into the robot, blowing it up and seemingly killing her and her husband. She survived the crash, however, and she and her husband eventually emerged from the wreck dressed in leopard skins, saying that since Tarou didn`t want to move away from his Kangaskhan family, they would live in the Safari Land with him from now on.",
