  "description" : "The Logi`s ace with a 190cm height and pointy hair. Kinji considers him as a transportation geek. This is all due to his knowledge about all kinds of vehicles may it be on land, sea or air. He is a skilled driver that can operate anything from a car to a nuclear submarine. His personal weapon is a Colt Python Revolver that uses .357 magnum bullet and only chose it for the sake of easy maintenance. Despite the astounding firepower, the gun`s loading capacity is small, the accuracy is horrible and it cannot equip a suppressor, so normally, no Butei would use it.\nGoki has feelings for Shirayuki; this is evidenced that he feels guilty for her when he tries to peek at the other girls in the hot springs of the OVA. Despite that, he is also a shameless pervert. He peeks at the girls in the girls` changing room locker, and tries to peek at the girls in the hot springs by climbing over the wall, claiming that `It`s a man`s world!`\nSource: Wiki",
