  "description" : "Shinigami, referred to with the suffix sama as a term of respect, is the God of Death himself (the Grim Reaper of Western legends). He is the leader of Shibusen and the most powerful character in the seriesâ€”with the kishin Asura being the only other character shown to match him in power. Eight hundred years prior to founding Shibusen, Shinigami used his own soul to seal Asura under the school. He is therefore unable to ever leave Death City. Back then he wore a more skull-like mask and spoke in a much scarier manner, but changed to not scare the children of his school. Though he acts and appears like a joker, if provoked he will return to his serious and threatening demeanour.",
