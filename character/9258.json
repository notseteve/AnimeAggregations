  "description" : "Takahashi Ryousuke is one of the most skilled drivers in the series (he is the Red Suns` fastest member as well as their leader); he and his younger brother http://anidb.net/ch9257 [Keisuke] (the Takahashi Brothers, also known as the Rotary Brothers because they both drive RX-7 versions) have been featured in racing magazines and are regarded highly by other drivers. Ryousuke drives a Mazda FC3S RX-7 and was previously undefeated until he met http://anidb.net/ch9199 [Fujiwara Takumi].\nRyousuke is very serious about racing; he pours over technical data just like any professional driver and he is one of the few drivers with skills as a mechanic to match those he possesses as a driver. He can usually be found in his room going over data on his laptop. He is known to be able to tell what kind of modifications have been made to a car just by hearing it, and what a driver is capable of just by watching the car drift. Ryousuke`s fame is so wide spread throughout Japan that he has been given the moniker, \"Akagi`s White Comet\".\nNote: Takahashi Ryousuke is modeled after the \"Drift King\" Keiichi Tsuchiya`s mentor and retired race car driver, Takahashi Kunimitsu.",
