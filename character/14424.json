  "description" : "Tsubasa was a parakeet in her past life. She was rescued by Gorou when she broke her wing and he took care of her. She is afraid of heights; this is because after she believed her wing was healed she tried to show her appreciation by showing him her beauty in flight. She tried to fly but fell from the house`s window and died. Her hairstyle represents a parakeet`s wings.\nTsubasa too has deep feelings for Gorou. She`s angry at Rei, the Red Phoenix (Suzaku), who is in love with her but hurt her beloved master. Her name means wing, alluding to her animal self. Her color image is red.\nIn Season 2 Tsubasa is a girl like none other. She may be a bit boyish but she still has the characteristics of being a girl or even a woman. Despite this she still strived for her master and eventually became stronger. Tsubasa is in the Intermediate rank (Senior rank in Season 2).",
