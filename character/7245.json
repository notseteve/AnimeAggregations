  "description" : "InuYasha is a hanyou (half-demon), the product of an inu-youkai (犬妖怪, dog demon) and a human. He wields Tetsusaiga, a supernatural sword made from one of his deceased father`s fangs. When properly wielded, the sword can destroy one hundred demons with a single swing. InuYasha can quickly recover from injuries that would be fatal to a human, largely due to his demonic blood. During the first night of each lunar month (new moon), InuYasha changes into a normal human with black hair and black eyes and loses his demonic powers.\nInuYasha was bound to Goshinboku by Kikyo`s arrow for fifty years until Kagome freed him. InuYasha wears a special bead necklace that forces him to respond to Kagome`s command \"Osuwari!\", which translates to \"Sit!\" in English. In the English-dubbed version, \"InuYasha, sit!\" or \"Sit, boy!\" are sometimes used instead. Following the command, InuYasha is thrown to the ground. Kaede had placed the necklace upon InuYasha because he had threatened to kill Kagome if she refused to give the Jewel of Four Souls to him. As the series goes on, he begins to like Kagome more and more, shown when he will leave a battle to save her from being hurt.",
