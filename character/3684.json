  "description" : "Kiyoka is Ran`s mother. She is also a police officer. It is a running gag throughout the series about her mysterious age, as she appears to be much younger than her husband. She is much more patient with Ran and the entire family in general- she never seems upset by Ran`s choice to be a Gal as is very supportive of her children.",
