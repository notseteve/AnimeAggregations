  "description" : "An underwater mobile suit developed for ZAFT`s invasion of Earth, and deployed along major shipping routes in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Used primarily for attacking enemy vessels and coastal bases, the GOOhN is designed for high speed and firepower, but its manoeuvrability is relatively low and it performs poorly on land. Its armament includes two phonon maser cannons and a battery of rocket-propelled torpedo launchers which can be used both in and out of the water, as well as a pair of powerful supercavitating torpedoes for underwater attacks.",
