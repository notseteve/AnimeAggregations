  "description" : "Shao May is http://anidb.net/ch10403 [May Chang]`s pet panda and traveling companion. Abandoned as a cub due to her abnormally small size, Shao May was cared for by May as if she were family and, therefore, has a particularly strong bond with the little girl. The two are constantly together and, as a bit of comic relief, Shao May frequently mimics Mei`s actions whether it be in expression, practicing alkahestry or performing martial arts, taking whatever pose her master takes and moving in synchronized union with her. Many characters also tend to mistake Shao May for a cat.",
