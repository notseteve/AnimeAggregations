  "description" : "Buccha, formerly of the Team Yaou (Night Kings) was defeated by Ikki and his team was forced to disband. Eventually, he joins Ikki`s team as one of the main power riders, making use of his extremely large build and strength. He recently obtained the title Mountain King of the Stone Road. In the manga he is known as the Black Pig for his seemingly overweight appearance. Ironically he isn`t truly fat, because all of the blood from his muscles go from his body to his belly due to his constant over eating and when he needs to, he reverts all the blood to his muscles, gaining super human strength and an extremely well built appearance. He can also be extremely scary at times.",
