  "description" : "Pochinosuke is a carnivorous plant being raised by Shinobu. She actually had no idea what it was when she randomly planted a seed she found in storage. It is actually a ninja weapon -- when thrown into a castle, it eats everything in sight until the castle is destroyed. Shinobu is the only one capable of controlling Pochinosuke when it goes on a rampage.",
