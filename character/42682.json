He led his troops in an attack on Aion but was slain along with the rest when sprayed with Rosette`s blood. In the manga, he appears much later in the story scouting the city in his human form. Duke Duffau led the assault on Eden and fought well against Aion with his bare hands. He ultimately falls when a geas is cast on all demons worldwide leaving him immobile and open to execution by Aion who has ripped out his own horns to escape the geas.\nSource: Wiki",
