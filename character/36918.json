  "description" : "A former imperial doctor to the royal family. He has the appearance of a tall, dark-haired man, but in the human world he takes up a provisional body due to his contempt of humans. This body is similar to one of Lamia`s \"muumuu\" pets, a random mass with a pair of eyes that can float above the ground at times. He is able to read minds. A highly skilled physician, he is first brought by Hilda in order to diagnose baby Beel, and is able to devise a cure for the kid by restablishing his bond to Oga. He comes back later to treat Hilda`s wound. Furcas and Saotome know each other, but the nature of the acquaintance, as Saotome`s connection to the demon world, is currently unknown. His name is probably a reference to a demon of the same name. It is later revealed that Furcas current position is as doctor to the 34th Pillar Squad.",
