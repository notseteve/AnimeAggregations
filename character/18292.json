  "description" : "Crux is a small fairy marionette brought to life by Oscha whose job it is to spy on Kaze the Hayakawa twins Yu and Ai. She will then report her findings to Oscha or whichever of the Lords of Gaudium is around.\nCrux`s entire vocabulary is made up of \"kukuruyu\". Periodically abused by the Lords of Gaudium, Crux developed feelings for Makenshi when he saved her life. Crux rebelled against Oscha and helped the protagonists during the battle against Chaos Tyrant.\nAfter the battle, Crux carried Makenshi away and tended to his wounds. She later becomes his traveling companion. Crux was damaged by Crux Number-2 when she found Madoushi`s grave. Crux received a gem from Makenshi`s older brother Madoushi, which contains his very power, from his grave. From this Makenshi learns the mist powers of his brother, and Crux is able to transform into the Cross Sword, Makenshi`s secondary weapon.",
