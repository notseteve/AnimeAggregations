  "description" : "The Joi War was a ten-year war of resistance, fought by the Japanese people against the Amanto (alien) invaders, who invaded Japan and eventually coaxed the Tokugawa shogunate into co-operating with them. Gintoki and several of his former allies fought during the tail end of the war, which had ended by the beginning of the series. Yet even during the period of peace, the more persistent members of the Joi faction have continued to resist the government, by means of terrorism and guerilla warfare.",
