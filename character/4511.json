  "description" : "Also known as \"Kaon of the Lunar Spiral,\" is the Absolute Angel Murakumo (a reference to the mecha/deity Ame no Murakamo from Kannazuki no Miko.) A student from the Higashigetsu Fuuma Witch Academy, she stages attacks on Kuu and her friends by order of Mika, although she does not seem to feed on the energy of innocent bystanders as Tarlotte does. Himiko usually appears with her. Despite the fact that she is Mika`s sword, she harbours a deep affection for Himiko, although she initially denies that their relationship is of a romantic nature.",
