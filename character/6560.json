  "description" : "Another one of http://anidb.net/ch6556 [Ayumi]`s friends, Nao is somewhat envious of http://anidb.net/ch6557 [Kei]`s attention. Along with http://anidb.net/ch6558 [Koyoi], she stops walking home with Ayumi for fear of http://anidb.net/ch6565 [Misao]. She is in her 2nd year of middle school. Being a member of the art club, she came to admire the artist who made the painting of a Sakura tree, http://anidb.net/ch8890 [Renjou Yukito], and after meeting him, asked him to assist her in making her own painting. However, upon his graduation, he left Japan, leaving her broken hearted. When she learned about http://anidb.net/ch6564 [Hiroyuki Sogabe]`s feelings towards her, she became close to him. She shares a strong resemblance to http://anidb.net/ch21615 [Misuzu Sotomura], a character from another of Kawashita`s works, http://anidb.net/a3067 [Ichigo 100%].",
