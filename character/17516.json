  "description" : "Sudo is driven by his will to nothing and his immanent misanthropy. He states that he is the power of destruction and his aim was to completely extinguish the human species. However he changed his mind in favour of Shiina... His intelligence and leadership made it easy for him to influence and manipulate the people around him and achieve his goals. He shows no emotion or compassion for anything. Probably killed his parents and brother as an act to symbolically \"renounce the future\".\nHe doesn`t follow an Ideology as it may be assumed from the anime, it was just his method to control his companions. He never stated clearly what his plans are, just made his comrades think they have the same goals. Therefore Mamiko Kuri aptly named his shadow dragon Trickster.\nQuotes:\nDo you really think we humans ... have a future?\n~\nProducts created only for profit are hollow and spiritless.\nAge at the beginning: ~16\nAge at the end: ~18\nShadow dragon: Trickster\nPhilosophy: Nihilism\nCharacter: Beyond good and evil\nMatching Song: Godflesh - Voidhead\nFurther read: Ulrich Horstmann - The Beast",
