  "description" : "Daughter to the corporate president of E-lectra, one of the biggest electronics companies in Japan. She lives in a modest-looking house with a housemaid, separate from her parents due to her father`s work. Ever the classy one, she tends to use honorific speech even towards her closest friends and is often annoyed by Torako`s mischief. Nonetheless, she has the tendency of ending up being taken along , forcefully or otherwise, with the other main heroines over the resulting shenanigans. Her name contains a kanji of dragon (龍, tatsu) and the first kanji letter of her name (伊) is pronounced as `I` (East), thus revealing her name`s relationship with Azure Dragon of the East (青龍).",
