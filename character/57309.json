  "description" : "The Chowlin Temple (食林寺 Shokurin Tera \"Food Forest Temple\") is a temple located in the Lost Forest. Its precise location is unknown even to big-name bishokuya, hence it`s nickname of the Disappearing Temple. The master of the temple is Chin Chinchin, one of the Gourmet National Treasures. The assistant masters are Shuu, Koppowo and Wagon.\nLike the Disappearing Cuisine the temple is made by materials that disappear if the visitors don`t pray respect at the building, but unlike the Disappearing Cuisine the materials attack the people without enough respect.\nThe temple is also a prison where the gourmet criminals are sent to learn respect for food. If the criminals try to escape they become lost in the forest. Unlike Honey Prison, where the criminals remain for the rest of their lives, if a criminal completes the training he become free again.",
