  "description" : "Hikaru is pretty much what you expect in an anime redhead: fire in her eyes, energetic and assertive almost to the point of aggressiveness. She`s a girl of action.\nShe`s also a girl of emotional extremes. She`s normally upbeat and happy all the time. Having a dog back home, she takes to the cute Mokona instantly. She is however vulnerable to bouts of deep depression, especially when something really shakes her to the core. She also looks a little young for her age and is a bit naive.\nHikaru is the most willing of the three (at first) to become a Magic Knight, and Hikaru`s magic sword is the most traditional, resembling a broadsword.\nHer family runs a kendo dojo, so she`s the quickest to get into the swing of things.\nInterestingly, though, she`s the last to revive her Guardian (Rayearth).\nShe is the Magic Knight of Fire and her name translates to \"Light of the Lion Shrine\".",
