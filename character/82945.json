  "description" : "Ash`s Noivern is the evolved form of Ash`s Noibat. It evovled during a battle against Zapdos in which Ash`s Hawlucha was hit and was falling out of the sky. Ash`s Noibat quickly went after Ash`s Hawlucha and on its way there, it evolved and managed to rescue it. As a result of evolving, it also learned the move Boomburst which was instrumental in the battle against Zapdos and defeating Team Rocket`s mecha which was trying to capture Zapdos. Once Zapdos realized that Ash`s Noivern wasn`t actually trying to hurt it or capture it when it protected it against Team Rocket, it was thankful and discontinued its aggression towards Ash.\nIn the first match-up in the 2nd 3-on-3 battle of Ash vs Sawyer (Scottie), Sawyer`s Doublade was paired up against Ash`s Noivern. Despite using Iron Defense multiple times to tire out Noivern, it tried to take advantage of a chance it thought it had but it backfired as Noivern used a combination of moves in the air to defeat Sawyer`s Doublade. Sawyer`s Clawitzer was sent out and its Dragon Pulse directly hit Noivern before it could finish launching its attack and knocked it out of the match.",
