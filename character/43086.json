  "description" : "The captain of the Neo Zeon ship \"Endra\". He is always seen wearing a garnished flower that Haman Khan gave to him, due to his obsession with her. He is first seen as an optimistic young officer and finds himself in a few comical situations among his own crew. However, a series of defeats at the hands of Judau Ashta and the AEUG, control of the Endra is handed over to Chara Soon.\nAt his second appearance he has largely abandoned his pacifistic and idealistic concepts and has adapted a colder, more destitute outlook towards battle.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
