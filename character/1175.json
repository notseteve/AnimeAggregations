  "description" : "Budew is a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Roselia by happiness during the day, whom evolves into Roserade by Shiny Stone.\nAt first glance, Budew barely has any similarities to its evolved forms, Roselia and Roserade. However, when the two \"vines\" that are on top of Budew`s head open up, a big spot can be seen on each vine (one that is blue and the other being red). As a matter of fact, the two vines are actually what will be the Pokémon`s flower-holding arms when it evolves into Roselia. Budew also appears to be wearing a green bib. This will become a skirt once it evolves.",
