  "description" : "Not to be confused with Sara`s Emily. Ralph also has an Emily, although she is a real little girl rather than a doll or Mimic, and she does not assist Ralph in his Strain. She sees herself as Ralph`s new little sister. She strongly resembles Sara`s Emily, except wearing a green dress rather than a red one, and she has strange blue markings on her face and hands. As a member of the alien race from which the E.M.L.Y. was developed, she is personally aware of everything that happens to the doll Emily and has developed an affection for Sara because of this.",
