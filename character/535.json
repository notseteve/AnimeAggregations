  "description" : "Meganium is the final form of the Chikorita evolutionary line. It is a human-sized, green creature resembling an apatosaurus, but with stamen-like antennae extending from its forehead and a large flower growing around its collar. Meganium`s antennae are smaller in females than in males.\nThe pheremones within its flower are its defense against those who would attack it for its size; they give off a fragrance that can instill feelings of peace and calm in all around it, thus suppressing their need to attack Meganium for food. This fragrance is effective enough to affect even a Pok√©mon like Primeape, which is noted for its unmatched temper. Meganium also has magically natural powers in its breath, which somehow is able to restore life to dead plants and grass.",
