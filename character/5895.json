He lives above http://anidb.net/ch40621 [his] http://anidb.net/ch40620 [family]`s business, Kamiya, a convenience store. He`s a high school student, and he dreams of being a rock star. If the rock star fantasy doesn`t work out he would rather take over his family business than go to college.\n(Unbeknownst to him, he is a Mindbreaker with his power lying within his voice.)\nKyouta is calm and accepts what occurs in his life. Some would believe he does not care. Really, he does care but he keeps his concerns to himself. He is new to his rising fame and popularity but still sees things innocently.",
