  "description" : "Kikuchiyo is a very strong mechanized samurai with a steam-powered arm that swings a massive sword that can tear through brick walls. However, Kikuchiyo is not at all skilled. In fact, all he knows about fighting he`s made up as he`s gone along, by emulating real samurai. The reason he has no skill is that he received no training, as he was actually born a low-class farmer, just like the people of Kanna Village. Kikuchiyo is a very careless and somewhat happy-go-luck person, often acting quite childish, which leads his companions to suspect he`s actually no older than the early teens, possibly about as young as http://anidb.net/ch3949 [Komachi], who in turn very much enjoys teasing him about that.",
