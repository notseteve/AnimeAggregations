  "description" : "Forretress is a bagworm as classified by the Pokédex, but its true appearance is unknown because it is always hidden inside a steel shell, the only visible part inside being its eyes. The shell itself has two parts: inner and outer. The inner shell is brick red and features four protrusions that look like small cannons. The outer shell is gray and pockmarked, like the surface of the moon. Forretress opens its shell only when it is catching prey, but it does so at such a quick pace that it is impossible to discern the nature of what lies inside, much less attack it while it is unprotected. Forretress can also shoot out bits of the shell for offensive purposes.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Brock`s Pineco evolves into a Forretress in the episode Entei At Your Own Risk. It is notable for being the only Pokémon he brought with him to Hoenn, and he has since left it at the gym in his hometown of Pewter City.",
