  "description" : "The \"Karate Keeper\", Wakashimazu Ken is a goalkeeper on par with http://anidb.net/ch2084 [Wakabayashi Genzou], but more offense-oriented. As his nickname implies, he is an expert karateka since his father is the master of a dojo. His father originally disapproved his efforts to become a footballer and his opposition to become the heir of the dojo.\nWakashimazu became interested in football when http://anidb.net/ch8344 [Hyuuga Kojirou] invited him to join the Meiwa team after being impressed by his abilities in a one-on-one duel that Wakashimazu lost. Since then, they are close friends.\nDespite being an excellent goalkeeper, he originally was a forward and only became goalkeeper because Meiwa didn`t have competent goalkeepers.\nA reliable partner of Hyuga while in the Meiwa and Toho teams, he and Wakabayashi regularly alternate in the goalkeeper position with the Japanese team.",
