  "description" : "Nono is the president of the Drama Research Society. She usually has a calm personality and her expression does not change much. When angered, however, she becomes very intimidating and has been known to be unstoppable when in this state of mind. Nono has an outward rivalry with the Drama Club president Mirei Sakaki and whenever the two of them meet they are sure to argue. Nono has a latent form of vocal cord paralysis and if she overexerts her voice too much, she may lose it at a young age. Nono was once a member of the Drama Society but later formed the Drama Research Society with Takashi and Risaki because she still wanted to act, which went against the wishes of Mirei.",
