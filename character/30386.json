She is a busty first year and a member of the crafts club along with Kureha, she is also revealed to be the chairman of the \"Let`s warmly protect Subaru-Sama committee\" and is shown to have a fetish for glasses and boy love which is expressed through her manga drawing of Kinjirou and Subaru (much to his chagrin). She is shown to be quite perverted, using a sheep ticket to coerce Subaru into reading a graphic novel of her and Kinjirou out loud prompting an offended Subaru to throw the book out a window. She apparently becomes drunk when she drinks carbonated drinks, and, in that state, gains a an ability known as the \"Stripping Drunken Fist\", where she can take off a person`s undergarments almost instantaneously.",
