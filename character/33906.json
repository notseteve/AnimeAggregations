  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch717 [Mitsukuni \"Honey\" Haninozuka]`s younger brother, whom Honey calls \"Chika\". He often feels overshadowed by his older brother and has grown a lasting resentment towards him for enjoying things that are cute and dropping out as the Karate Club`s President. He is also very astonished by the amount of cake he eats in one night and how quickly he does so. His greatest ambition is to one day finally defeat his brother in combat, but in the end Honey easily defeats him, choosing the things he loves most over his brother`s feelings, much to Mori`s surprise.\nYasuchika`s best friend is Satoshi Morinozuka, the younger brother of Mori. Both seem to be polar opposites of their older brothers, however, it is shown that underneath Chika`s attitude, he is much like Honey, crying easily and collecting cute stuffed toy chicks and chick photo books. He goes to seventh grade while his older brother is at Ouran Academy.",
