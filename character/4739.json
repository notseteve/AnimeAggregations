  "description" : "A sixteen-year-old Level 6 psychokinetic high-schooler originally known as \"Kitty Cat\", at the beginning Naomi`s naive mistakes would make for a less-than-perfect working environment and would not be regarded as a laughing matter (either at the time or after the fact) under normal real-life circumstances. Naomi has built a solid four-year history with her supervisor Ichirou and seems to sincerely wants to do well for both herself and B.A.B.E.L.\nHowever, during one of her missions when she is charged with stopping a psychic who uses his powers to molest women, she begins to have trouble using her powers and accidentally injures her supervisor. After training with the Children, she has a simulated duel with Kaoru acting exactly as the psychic she tried to stop. Naomi realizes that Ichirou`s intense affection for her is not entirely the altruistic and professional working relationship that it is supposed to be. When they next meet the peeping esper, Naomi takes out both the esper and her somewhat perverted supervisor. It is at this point Naomi gains the nickname \"Wild Cat\", the rationale of which is demonstrated whenever Ichirou tries to manipulate Naomi and fails to keep his professional (and physical) distance.",
