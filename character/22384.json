Brutella has a very grouchy personality and she doesn`t get along very well with people.\nNastina owned the Beach House Obaba which was located on the beach of Aopulco. She lent money to Moe to help his business. When Ash and his friends arrived, Moe had till the next day to pay back the money to Brutella. She didn`t care if he went bankrupt as that would lower her competition for customers.\nTeam Rocket worked for Brutella to get some money for their mecha repairs but a missle from their submarine severely damaged the Beach House Obaba, leaving Brutella to deal with the mess.",
