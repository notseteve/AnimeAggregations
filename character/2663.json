  "description" : "Jupiter first appeared while stealing the Lustrous Orb and the Adamant Orb from the Celestic Town museum.\nAt Team Galactic`s headquarters, she used her Skuntank to stop Ash and his friends from saving Azelf, Uxie and Mesprit. She later arrived at Mt. Coronet along with Cyrus, Saturn, Jupiter and Charon, but was left to keep watch over Ash and the others who were kept captive by Team Galactic. While being on guard, her Skuntank was attacked by Cynthia`s Garchomp, and thus, not being able to counterattack, she was taken prisoner by Looker and Team Rocket. To Looker`s surprise, when asked, she said that she wouldn`t care at all if she would disappear too, together with the old world, due to a new one being created by her boss.\nAfter Team Galactic`s plan had been thwarted by Ash and the others, she was arrested along with Mars and Saturn. When she queried them about their boss` state, she was shocked to hear that he entered the portal to the new universe all by himself.",
