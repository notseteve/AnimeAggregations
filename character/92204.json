  "description" : "Kobuchizawa Shirase is a second-year high school student who attends the same school as Kimari. She is a black-haired beauty that turns heads, but she is shy and not good at conversation. When she actually does speak, she can`t help but say rather nasty things, which leads to misunderstandings. She has few friends and is treated as an oddball at school. At school, she is secretly called \"Antarctica.\"\nSource: kadokawa",
