  "description" : "Matsumoto Rangiku is the busty vice-captain of Soul Society`s tenth protection squad. She is quite energetic and likes to have fun, especially if it involves a bottle of sake. Despite having a completely contrasting personality to her captain, http://anidb.net/ch8354 [Hitsugaya], Matsumoto bounces off well against her superior. When in battle, she fights with her zanpakutou, http://anidb.net/ch10805 [Haineko], which has the ability to turn into ash, surrounding the enemy to attack them.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
