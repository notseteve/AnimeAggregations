  "description" : "Jin spent the majority of his life training in kenjutsu dojos. Unlike Mugen, it is legal for him to carry a daisho, as he is of the samurai class. His swords have a lightning and twin-eyed design on the tsuba. He wears traditional hakama and gi in indigo blue patterned with a white diamond kamon made up of four small white diamonds. His kamon closely resembles that of the great Takeda Clan, leading to speculation that his family origins may be of nobility. He also sports a Buddhist Rosary and a pair of anachronistic wire-rimmed glasses (which he does not actually need), the latter of which is probably the single most distinctive aspect of his appearance and the one everybody remembers.",
