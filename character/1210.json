  "description" : "Drifblim resemble hot air balloons with wings that resemble flags. Drifblim have a wispy cloud on their heads and a large yellow \"X\" on their faces resembling a taped up balloon. It is able to carry humans and Pokémon to various places using the wind as a guide. Drifblim appear in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. One is used by both Gym Leader Fantina and Elite Four Flint. One of its known Ghost-type moves is Ominous Wind (Both Fantina and Flint taught their Drifblim this move), which has the chance of raising all of the user`s stats if it hits (similar to Ancientpower and Silver Wind). It bears a similarity to the imaginary miles-wide balloon-like creatures that could live on a gas giant. Fantina and her Drifblim appear in DP093.",
