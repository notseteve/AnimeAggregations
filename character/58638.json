  "description" : "Claude is one of the leaders of the Bee Hive Gangsters, and one of the few characters who suspects the relationship between Raku and Chitoge is fake. He stalks Chitoge regularly to make sure Raku does not take advantage of her. Chitoge stated that when she was young, she was unable to make friends because of Claude`s overprotectiveness and background checks. He raises Tsugumi as a hitman, and appears to be clueless as to her gender, having given her a boy`s name, Seishirou.\nSource: Wiki",
