  "description" : "The Guncannon is the second model of prototype mobile suits developed by the Earth Federation. Designed for medium-range support, it`s equipped with a pair of shell-firing cannons in its shoulders, and can carry a beam rifle for additional firepower. While the Guncannon`s heavy armour means it doesn`t need to carry a shield, its greater weight makes it less agile than the Gundam. Only one Guncannon survives the Zeon attack on the Side 7 research colony, and it`s soon assigned to civilian recruit Kai Shiden.",
