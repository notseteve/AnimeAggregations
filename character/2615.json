  "description" : "Attila is a member of Team Rocket. He appeared along with his partner, Hun, in \"The Legend of Thunder!\".\nAttila and Hun both seem somewhat set in their rank, and approach missions casually. They seem to be keep their cool even when they lose. Even in these situations, they beat a calm retreat. Despite physical stereotypes, Hun is the dominant partner, telling Attila to do things that he could do himself. Attila doesn`t object, or show any signs of aggravation over this role. One particular event where Attila loses his temper is when he finds that Marina has called for help. He yells through her Pok√©Gear, causing Vincent and Jimmy on the other end to nearly fall over, and then smashes it.\nAttila has no recorded history with his partner Hun though, while the dub states that they are new partners, their body language and the familiarity of the behaviour towards each other shows that they do have history together.\nThe pair takes mission orders from Professor Sebastian, but it is implied in the Japanese dub that they have never met him before.",
