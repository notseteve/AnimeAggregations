  "description" : "The fifth member of the Rune Angel Troupe, Anise Azeat is a red-haired girl with blue eyes. She has a very outgoing, active, and competitive personality. She also uses a rather rough talking style, including the use of the male pronoun \"ore\". While originally from a clan of gypsy pirates and a treasure hunter hired to steal the Brave Heart (Which Nano-Nano tries to stop her from stealing it, she slips and started falling but Anise grabs her hand and saved Nano-Nano. Since then Nano-Nano starts calling her master or big sister) she eventually joins the Angel Troupe, in no small part due to the assistance of Mint Blancmanche. She also looks up to Ranpha Franboise, referring to her as \"Nee-san\" (literally \"Big sister\"). Her running gag is a tendency to mispronounce words, especially names. To Mint`s displeasure, Anise once referred to her as \"Mint Butamanju\" (literally \"Mint Porkbun\"). She has also been seen to touch Kazuya in familiar ways, such as punching him in the arm, resulting in him calling her `tomboy`, and running away. (Sometimes, even crying.)",
