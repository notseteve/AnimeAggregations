  "description" : "Hailing from France, Aria is a rather soft-spoken character who has a tendency to cry whenever there is trouble, uttering the phrase \"kusu\" (an onomatopoeia for sniffling) when doing so. She enjoys sweets, especially parfait, and can usually be found wearing very frilly dresses with plenty of lace and bows. She refers to herself in the third-person, which is considered childish in Japanese culture, and speaks slowly.\nIn the first anime, Wataru comments that time seems to pass more slowly around Aria, especially to someone who is used to the high-paced life of the city. In the second anime, Aria comments that being in the brother`s company relieves her of her `sleepy feelings`, energizing her.\nShe addresses the brother as Nii-ya (兄や?) the most childish name for one`s brother. Her birthday is November 2, is a Scorpio, and stands 139 cm (about 4` 7\") tall.",
