  "description" : "Damian Baldur Flugel is the prince of the Kingdom of Flugel who is set to marry princess http://anidb.net/ch95301 [Charlotte] of the Kingdom of Drossel.\nThe first time Damian met Charlotte was outside the Drossel castle. She was crying due to her frustration that every man she met on her birthday would be a possible future husband for her. Damian told her that she came off as a sassy brat and was glad that she could cry too. He ensured her that it was okay for her to cry. The fact that he spoke with her so casually with no motives, made Charlotte really happy and ever since that day, she couldn`t forget that moment.\nAfter the war, Charlotte received a proposal out of nowhere. She was determined to make the marriage be between Drossel and Flugel, and eventually, Drossel chose Flugel family.\nSource: Violet Evergarden Wiki",
