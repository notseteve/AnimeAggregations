  "description" : "Otto von Braunschweig was an Imperial Duke and the husband of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch206 [Friedrich IV]`s daughter Princess Amarie, being among the most influential high nobles at court during the waning years of the Goldenbaum Dynasty. A major opponent of the upstart http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], he stood for preserving the old order during the Imperial Civil War. Although he possessed much wealth and military might, Duke Braunschweig proved to be incompetent and came to be viewed as the personification of the decadence and decline of the Imperial nobility.\nHe was forced to commit suicide by his chief retainer shortly after the confederated aristocrat forces were defeated by Lohengramm.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
