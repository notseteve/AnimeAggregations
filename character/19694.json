  "description" : "Nakayama Yayoi is initially forced to harass Ikki by Buccha`s team but supports Kogarasumaru later on. Yayoi has the ability to communicate with Ikki`s crow and to tell the exact time, down to a second, a trait that is shared amongst the more affluent tuners of Tool Toul To. It was first seen that she has a crush on Ikki on the chapter against the Sabel Tigers but after the trip to Kyoto she lost interest in him. It was said by Makigami Ine that she saw potential in Yayoi as an AT-Tuner, she even mistook Yayoi as the team`s tuner. In fact, during Kogarasumaru`s battle against the original Sleeping Forest in Inorganic Net, when Agito gets injured, she is the one who tunes him back to health and finally completes the Fang Regalia that had been merged into his AT`s.",
