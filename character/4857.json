  "description" : "The youngest sister of the Yoshikawa family. She can also use magic, and she loves just about anything that involves making money, a subject that makes her adopt the demeanour (and voice) of a Scrooge-like miser. Many times she comes up with excuses for the strange events which occur to non-magic people, and is fantastic at problem solving. She has short periwinkle hair with a yellow and black ribbon.",
