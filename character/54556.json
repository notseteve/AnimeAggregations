  "description" : "Judy Abbott is a cheerful and intelligent girl whose parents died when she was still a son. She was found at Bayson avenue at New York City and was taken into the John Grier Home, where she develops her talent for writing. It is one of her essays that catches the attention of a trustee known as \"John Smith\", enabling her to earn a scholarship from him to attend the Lincoln Memorial High School. She does not know who John Smith is, and calls him \"Daddy Long Legs\". Even so, she considers him the only family she has, and becomes attached to him. She talks very much and loves story telling. Judy`s roommates at Lincoln Memorial are Sallie McBride and Julia Pendleton. Judy has a considerable inferiority complex that she is orphan, she suffers not to be able to confide it to anyone. In the anime, Judy`s appearance seem to resemble like Pippi Longstocking, by having red-hair and braids sticking out.",
