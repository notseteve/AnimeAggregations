  "description" : "Antares is the leader of the bandits of Grape Valley on Titan and guardian to a large collection of children orphaned by the human-hunting Count Mecha. (In the TV series, he was simply stealing in order to care for his own children.) He hates the machine people, and technology in general. Antales tells Tetsuro to seek out the pirate Emeraldas if he wishes to find the location of Count Mecha`s Time Castle, and advises the youngster to shoot the Count without giving him a moment`s pity. His body still contains a large number of unexploded energy bullets, which go off at the most inconvenient moment, just as he is about to warn Tetsuro of an important secret regarding Maeter.\nSource: Cornponeflicks.org",
