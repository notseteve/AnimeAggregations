  "description" : "1st Vongola Generation Cloud Guardian\nAlaude headed a secret intelligence agency in an unidentified country. He physically resembles Hibari, and despite their preference for solitude Dino notes that they both show benevolence towards allies, even though Hibari`s manner of doing so is outwardly unfriendly and even violent. His Weapon of choice was known as Alaude Handcuffs, and Hibari`s Cloud Hedgehog can Cambio Forma into a similar Weapon.\nAlaude was a powerful fighter who never stood with the rest of the Family. However, it was said that whenever Giotto`s and his version of justice coincided, he took down more enemies and showed more compassion than the others.",
