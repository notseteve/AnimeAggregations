  "description" : "A fat man with curly blond hair who holds a high position within the A-Laws. He initially appears in the epilogue of the first season, next to Kati Mannequin in the Federation lineup, but is not introduced proper until second season. He overlooks the A-Laws` operation against Katharon, and is highly interested in Barrack`s and Louise`s encounter with Gundams Exia and Seravee, stating that \"more equipment\" is required. He is later seen in a conversation with Kati Manneqin and Arba Lindt. After Lindt`s defeat to Celestial Being, Arthur orders that the command be given back to Kati Manneqin, telling them that failure is unacceptable in A-Laws. He is one of the A-Laws officers present in the A-Laws party. He is later seen leading the operations to obliterate the Suille Kingdom, destroy the Africa Tower along with the coup d`etat forces, and attack Celestial Being using the Memento Mori weapons. He is also seen at the speech of the ESF President, and later after the operation in episode 19 to wipe out the Gundams and the Ptolemaios II, mocking Healing Care for her failure to carry out the operation, and also decrying the decision to give her and Revive licenses. His assault, however, fails due to an uprising led by Kati Mannequin aiding Celestial Being and Katharon, with Setsuna killing Goodman.",
