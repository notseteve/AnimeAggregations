  "description" : "Kokone is a type A7M3 production robot who works as a courier in what remains of Musashino, Tokyo. She is the first robot that http://anidb.net/ch11306 [Alpha] meets, when she delivers a package (containing a camera) and a message from Alpha`s owner. They soon become friends, and Kokone eventually develops romantic feelings for Alpha.\nKokone is sweet, shy, and somewhat intellectual, but because of her job she has more experience with people than Alpha, and can sometimes pass for human. After meeting Alpha, her \"older sister\" production-wise, Kokone becomes curious about the history and nature of robots. Unlike Alpha, she is able to process animal protein.\nSource: Wikipedia",
