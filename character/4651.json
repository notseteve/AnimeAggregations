  "description" : "Bogie is Honoka`s partner. He`s an A.I. unit that acts as Honoka`s guide, guardian, and friend. The actual casing he resides in isn`t very large, but he`s usually fixed into Honoka`s tank to act as its pilot. He has a very straightforward personality and is often strict with Honoka, especially when it comes to her safety. He seems to nag a bit when she doesn`t wake up on time, or follow a specific course of action... but perhaps that`s to be expected of a computer. Regardless, Bogie cares about Honoka a great deal.",
