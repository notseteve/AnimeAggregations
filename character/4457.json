  "description" : "Kiseki is Tadase`s Guardian Character. Kiseki was born for a combination of Tadase`s desire to be stronger and the dream of world domination. Because of this, Kiseki is extremely egotistical and often demanding, and doesn`t like obeying others. He frequently calls other Guardian Characters to go on \"Special Secret Meetings.\" A running gag is that the other Guardian Characters will ignore him sometimes. Kiseki is aware of Tadase`s crush on Amu and acts the same way as Amu`s Guardian Characters whenever Tadase seems to be confessing to Amu. Kiseki holds a grudge against Ikuto`s Guardian Character, Yoru. During Character Change, Tadase gains the confidence to overcome his shyness. However, sometimes Tadase will become an egotistical person who seeks world domination.",
