  "description" : "Shinx generates electricity from the yellow bands on its front legs, much like the red spots on Pikachu`s cheeks. Upon sensing danger, it shoots out a dazzling light from every hair on its body. While the opponent is blinded, it takes the opportunity to quickly escape. The yellow pattern on its ears and tail is reminiscent of flashes of light.",
