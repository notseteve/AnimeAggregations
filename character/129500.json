After telling this to their older sister, Lana then recalled the day that her and Mallow first met. They too had got lost in the forest and were fed Haban Berry by a Pokémon. After being rescued from falling off a cliff, they met Grandpa Forest, a sweet Drampa who likes playing with children.\nAfter remembering that day, Lana and Mallow went back into the forest to find Grandpa Forest. Just as they were reunited, Team Rocket showed up trying to capture the Drampa. It quickly got rid of them with a Twister attack as it wasn`t impressed with their attempt to imitate children to try to catch it.\nReunited with Grandpa Forest, it remembered Lana and Mallow and they played a quick game of Peekaboo and they thanked it for saving Sarah and Harper.",
