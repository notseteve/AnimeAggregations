  "description" : "Esdeath is a high-ranking general of the Empire, and leader of the Jaegers. She enjoys torturing her enemies slowly, seen when she used her Teigu to put large blocks of ice in a cauldron so that the people inside would die slower and suffer more. Despite her sadistic actions, she is actually shown to have a compassionate heart when it comes to the lives of her men and others close to her.\nShe is looking for love and although her expectations were high, when she saw Tatsumi`s skills and smile she fell in love with him.\nSource: Akame ga Kill!
