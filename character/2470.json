  "description" : "Shirai Kuroko is a level 4 psychic, and member of Judgement, a special public committee group, whose duty it is to maintain peace and order in Academy City. She is in love with Misaka, who she calls \"Onee-sama\" (sister) and tends to get jealous if someone else gets her attention. This unfortunately happens to be Touma, since he has caught the attention of Misaka for various reasons. Her special power is instant teleportation, which allows her to teleport herself and anything in her possession - as long as it weighs around 130-137 kilograms - to anywhere in a radius of around 81-85 metres.",
