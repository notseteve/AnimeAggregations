  "description" : "Hatori Chise is the apprentice and future bride to http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias Ainsworth]. Her father abandoned the family when she was young, taking her little brother with him, and eventually her mother committed suicide in front of her. Feeling unwanted by her relatives, she sold herself into slavery so that she didn`t have to worry about anything.\nShe is also a Slay Vega, a special magus who can draw magic from her surroundings and within herself, at the cost of dying young because of the strain in her body, hence why Elias took her in, hoping to prevent her death. She has about 3 years left to live naturally at most.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
