  "description" : "A 16-year-old-girl who ends up as Seiji`s right hand. She has had a crush on him for three years. One day she wishes to be with him so much that she finds herself, in miniature form, in the place of his right hand. This causes problems for him, since it is the \"Devil`s right-hand\" he punches with. As soon as Midori finds out that she is on Seiji`s hand, she gathers the courage to admit her love, even though it isn`t requited. During the series she continually confesses her love, and gets jealous of other girls, often trying to compete with them; but over time she begins to like qualities of all of the characters, including her \"rivals\".",
