  "description" : "Kirishima is a maid in the service of the Houjou family. She sees it as her duty to watch over Reika. She carries a wakizashi sword. Unlike Hosaka who uses relatively casual (though not rude) speech patterns with Reika, Kirishima uses only Japanese honorifics towards Reika, but quickly reverts back to blunt speech towards Shungo, whom she thinks is not worthy of Reika, and is always trying to execute him.\nSource: Wikipedia",
