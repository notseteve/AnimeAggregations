  "description" : "Xerneas is known as the \"Life Pokémon\" and it is said to grant life to both people and Pokémon. When Yveltal caused the \"Great Destruction\", it is said Xerneas was the only Pokémon able to oppose it.\nDiancie went looking for Xerneas to help it receive the Fairy Aura that would let it unleash its true power and create a Sacred Diamond. Dace explained that it was only alive today because Xerneas assisted him. Once Diancie met Xerneas, it already knew why Diancie was there and granted her that wish.\nWhen Yveltal was reawakened and began to cause havoc in the Alearth Woods, Xerneas intervened and Yveltal was driven off. It transformed into a tree to heal the Alearth Woods and the living creatures and people that were there.",
