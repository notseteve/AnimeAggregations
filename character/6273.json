  "description" : "Referred to as `Idol Red`, Rouge is a pink-haired member of Eclipse, a musical group from the moon and a street Bigfoot Basketball team. She`s shown to have a spunky, rebellious attitude, apparent when she runs away from her manager and the press, eventually involving Dan in her escape by kissing him to hide her face. This, however, was caught on camera, and started the rumor that she was dating `Dunk Mask`. Later on, she, along with the rest of her team mates, participates in a match against Dan, Iceman and Sela, one of Team Basquash`s many traveling/fugitive matches. In the match, she receives a few slight injuries, to which she disregards, until she receives a particularly strong blow; Dan then dismounted his Bigfoot and carried her so she could recieve medical attention. She later reveals to her teammates that she has developed feelings for him because of this action.",
