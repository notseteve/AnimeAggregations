  "description" : "Spitfire is one of the gravity children, who escaped from the tower and is also said to be one of the gravity children to be gotten rid of along with Nike and Sora. He is the first Flame King and one of the original members of Sleeping Forest. As the Flame King, he can ride at such high speeds that they create the illusion of flames due to the heat caused by the friction of his wheels on the ground. He can also create the illusion of stopping time, much like Yasuyoshi Sano, one of his former subordinates. Sometime after Sleeping Forest`s defeat at the hands of Kilik he joins Genesis and becomes Simca`s close friend and advisor. He is in control of three teams and is a highly sought after hair stylist in everyday life. He begins to acknowledge Ikki after talking to Simca and witnessing some of his battles, such as the race with Buccha (whom he knew and advised well before he had any ties to Ikki and the rest of Kogarasumaru). He later takes an interest in Kazu and proclaims him to be the next Flame King after realizing the true purpose of Genesis and Takeuchi Sora and knowing that his own end might come near as a result of his betrayal. He and Sano eventually battle Sora and Nike using a combination of their styles known as the Apollo Road, though they lose and Spitfire is killed. He leaves behind the Flame Regalia and his will in the form of a video file that contains the truth about Genesis and an advanced training program that is able to recognize speech and react accordingly.",
