  "description" : "The usually patient and sweet-natured Hare (whose name means `fair weather`) is usually troubled by Guu`s joy in creating chaos and he is prone to anxious rants or tantrums whenever Guu does something unnatural. This is accompanied by a sudden downpour of rain. Hare is used by his mother, Weda, to do household chores and he is teased by Guu for having an Oedipus complex, exhibited in his competitive nature trying to keep Dr. Clive away from Weda. Hare tends to think about things too much, and Guu takes advantage of that by psychoanalyzing Hare at every opportunity, and playfully taking advantage of Hare`s neurosis.",
