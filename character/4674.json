  "description" : "A Tokyo University graduate and professor who specialises in archaeology, appearing to be a parody of Indiana Jones. Like Keitarou, he was a third-year ronin. He`s clumsy - especially with women, a terrible driver (his arrival often heralded by his van crashing down from the sky), and an exceptionally skilled martial artist, all partly due to his complete lack of self-preservation. Seta spends a good deal of his time travelling the world on one expedition or another. His goal seems to be to find evidence of the ancient turtle civilization that once flourished throughout east Asia.",
