  "description" : "C.C. is an immortal girl who outwardly appears to be little more than 16 years old. She becomes Lelouch Lamperouge`s accomplice when he makes a Geass contract with her. She is willful almost to a fault, usually doing whatever she wants regardless of whether or not it inconveniences others, particularly with Lelouch. She also likes to withhold information, usually telling people just enough to leave them wondering. C.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut`s; she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch`s house using his credit card. She loves pizza so much that by ordering it over a long period of time, she received a loyalty reward of a stuffed toy named Cheese-kun, which she has been shown cuddling on multiple occasions.",
