  "description" : "An expert Saiseiya and Teppei`s master. He is nicknamed \"Blood-stained Yosaku\" due to his seemingly brutal methods of healing. He wears a blood-soaked doctor`s coat (befitting to his nickname), a black bandanna worn over his hair and is always seen smoking a cigar branch. He hates following rules of any kind, be it simple rules such as to not smoke in a restaurant or go against rules of life itself. He has been described as a very strong person able to take down one of the Four Heavenly Kings, with Teppei`s assistance (though Teppei notes that Yosaku had fully restrained him), a testament to his power. Despite his rough appearance he is a master in healing. He has been to the Gourmet World and knows the location of the dessert Sunny is looking for, EARTH.",
