  "description" : "An enormous aircraft with the capacity to carry a vast array of weapons, the SB-10/10 Starwing is a heavy bomber used by the U.N. Forces in 2040. The Starwing is both an advanced bomber craft and a throwback to the flying wing design of the pre-Space War I era. Utilizing modern stealth technologies, the Starwing can carry a very large payload of bombs and missiles inside internal bays as well as act as a carrier craft for up to four drone fighters docked via pylons attached to underwing hard points.\nThe SB-10/10 Starwing was used extensively during the Project Super Nova AVF competition in early 2040. During testing of the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] fighter, a flight of five Starwings were used as carriers for 20 drone fighters meant to engage the test fighter with unarmed ordnance. Bomber Nine initiated the sham attack with it`s remote control drones, but the command craft and it`s flight remained outside the testing zone.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/starwing.htm",
