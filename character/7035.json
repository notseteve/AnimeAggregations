  "description" : "Kim works on the bridge as the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]`s communications officer. It is rumored that Kim was a fashion model prior to joining the military. She still enjoys dressing up and her urges to break out of the strict UPSF dress code cause problems between her and http://anidb.net/ch7033 [Yuriko Star]. Her hobbies include shopping and modern dance. She likes to read a women`s magazine called \"Enen\" in her free time, but is absolutely professional where her job is concerned.\nShe is cool-headed in a crisis and extremely skilled as a communications officer. She says at one point that she transfered onto the Soyokaze in order to find direction in her life, and there`s the strong possibility she did it after breaking up with a man.",
