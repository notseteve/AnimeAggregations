  "description" : "He is Isami in the same future timespace as Karasu. He also became a Dragon Knight. Unlike the tormented Karasu, Fukurou managed to keep his sense of humour and laid-back personality, and his motto seems to be \"Don`t worry about it.\"\nBeing Karasu`s best friend, Fukurou failed the mission to kill him when he was declared a traitor; deciding instead to aid Karasu. However, Noein killed Fukurou after Haruka changed the future she saw in which it was Karasu who killed him. Fukurou is a close friend with the future Ai, and expresses his wish to see her one more time as he dies. Fukurou`s spin weapon appears to be clusters of laser-like projectiles. He seems to find Haruka`s timespace less painful than Karasu, looking fondly on Ai, Yuu and his younger self, and admonishing Yuu and Isami to \"stay friends.\" Like Karasu, he looks very different from his younger self - tall, muscular, with a long brown ponytail and only one eye (presumably lost in a gang war in his teens).",
