  "description" : "Flygon has its natural habitat in the desert, across which it flies. Flygon`s wings kick up a cloud of dust and sand each time they flap, so that whenever Flygon moves, it is surrounded by a constant sandstorm. This provides Flygon with a useful cover from enemies and other unwanted visitors who lose themselves in the dust cloud, while Flygon itself maintains perfect vision thanks to red covers that shield its eyes from the storm. But it is at a disadvantage in the jungle because the trees are so close together they cover almost the entire floor of the jungle from a bird`s-eye view. This Pokémon is known as \"The Desert Spirit.\" When inside a Flygon-created sandstorm, the only thing one is aware of is the melodious sound of Flygon`s wings, which can resemble the notes of a song. Because of this, and the Pokédex related cry, it is thought that perhaps Flygon has the ability to buzz its wings at a rapid pace to create a melody.",
