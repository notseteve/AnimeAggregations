  "description" : "Paul`s Gastrodon was the second Pok√©mon Paul sent out to battle against Ash during their full battle at the Sinnoh League. It proved to be a formidable opponent as Ash`s Staraptor pinned it on the ground but a quick change by Ash to recall Staraptor proved to be a good strategy as Ash`s Buizel defeated Paul`s Gastrodon with an Ice Punch.",
