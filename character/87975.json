The egg was brought to the school from where it was found on Mount Lanakila.\nAfter the Pancake Race, everyone was at the Pok√©mon School to watch it hatch into Alola Form Vuplix. Lillie said she had already named it Snowball and that the name came from the fact that it is white as snow and often rolls around like a ball.",
