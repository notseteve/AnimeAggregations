  "description" : "The \"midget\" of the Blade Children, she resembles a 13-year-old child rather than her actual age, 16. Although Rio appears to be the most innocent of the Blade Children with her cherubic features and size, she is actually very shrewd and calculating. Rio knows how to create bombs, devise difficult plans and kill those she considers her enemies. Kanone even calls her a \"fire pixie\" in the manga for her small, impish appearance and skill with explosives. She is extremely intelligent and is able to escape from any sticky situation, no matter how small or tight it is. She is very straight-forward and has a crush on Eyes because he gives her \"netted pattern\" melons (her favourite food). Like Kousuke, she will not hesitate to kill people if she has to",
