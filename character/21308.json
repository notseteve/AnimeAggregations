  "description" : "1st Vongola Generation Storm Guardian\nG. was Giotto`s childhood friend. He helped Giotto form a vigilante group that became the core of the Vongola Famiglia. He physically resembles Gokudera, right down to their shared smoking habit, and has a tattoo on the right side of his face. He initially used a Gun which he carried almost as a part of himself, much like Gokudera`s Dynamite, but switched to a Bow given to him by Giotto himself whenever he acted in the name of the Vongola. He has been implied to have a closer relationship to Giotto than the other Guardians, much closer than Tsuna and Gokudera are currently. ",
