  "description" : "Gabite is Dragon/Ground like Gible. Being a Ground/Dragon pok√©mon, it is derived of the Dragon type`s protection against the Water and Grass types, and these inflict normal damage instead; Ice type attacks will instead of dealing two times the damage to Gabite deal four times the damage! On the other hand, Electric attacks will be totally negated since Gabite is Ground. Gabite evolves into Garchomp at level 48. There is a long-held belief that medicine made from its scales will heal even incurable illnesses. It habitually digs up and hoards gems in its nest. Its loot is constantly targeted by thieves and crooks.",
