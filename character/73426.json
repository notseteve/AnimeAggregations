  "description" : "Pollyanna meets Jimmy first while playing around on the railing of a bridge. Upon falling down, he saves her from falling into the water.\nJimmy himself is an orphan that was sent from another orphanage to Beldingsville. But the orphanage there also can`t take him in so he becomes homeless and starts to do some work for Tom. Instead of money he gets materials to build his own home in the Pendleton woods. One day, upon finishing his little shack, Pollyanna learns from him that his dead father left an envelope with information about him with the orphanage staff before he died. On it are instructions for it not to be opened until the boy turns 30 years old. Pollyanna is focused on finding out what is in the letter, hoping it would be Jimmy`s pedigree - all in order to get Mr Pendleton to adopt him.",
