  "description" : "Lilith is a small fairy who carries the Lilith Mirror, an object allowing whoever holds it to see a monster`s true form as well as their hidden desires, but at the cost of the user`s soul. The mirror was given to Kyoko by Ishigami with the intention to create a schoolwide uproar by revealing the students` true forms as well as with the intention of stealing Tsukune`s soul, but it eventually failed. In the anime, Kyoko accidentally obtains Lilith and the Lilith Mirror after a run-in with Kokoa, who was intending to use it to split Inner Moka from Outer Moka. Lilith was eventually defeated by the teamwork of Mizore, Ruby, Yukari and Kurumu.",
