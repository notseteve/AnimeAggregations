  "description" : "The muscular, silent, micloned Zentradi is the drummer for the band Fire Bomber. Little is known of her past as she rarely speaks. A pseudo-documentary on the history of the members of Firebomber (as seen in Macross 7 Encore, episode 1), containing dramaticised versions of events, shows that Veffidas was a street performer who did fire-eating tricks and knife-throwing while still in her giant form. She meets the child Basara as he gives her some food (which he had gotten by initially trying to trade his guitar to a baker, who just gave him the bread because he liked Basara`s music).\nSource: Wikipedia",
