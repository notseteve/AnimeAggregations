  "description" : "Jessica is a Pok√©mon Groomer in training. She had a Trimmien that she would like to cut and coif but it initially wouldn`t let her. Trimmien are very intelligent and can recognize the Trainer`s nature; if they don`t approve, they won`t listen to them. At the time it didn`t trust Jessica, it ran off an accidentally hit Bonnie causing her to get scraped.\nAs an apology for getting Bonnie hurt, Jessica invited Ash and his friends to her masters shop. After gaining some confidence from an encounter with Rocket Gang, Jessica and her Trimmien began to work together and trust each other. From now on, Jessica vowed to trust her Trimmien much more, gain lots and lots of experience and become a Star Groomer someday.Serena asked to get her Fokko groomed when that happened.",
