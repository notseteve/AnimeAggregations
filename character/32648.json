  "description" : "Keito is a spider-woman ordered by Kuyou to keep an eye on the Newspaper Club (to make sure it wasn`t doing anything the PSC considered \"illegal\"). She seems to have a past with Kurumu in the manga, calling her a \"newspaper slut\" during their initial meeting, and later caught Kurumu distributing the papers with Tsukune despite Gin`s warnings. Although she manages to overpower Kurumu and Tsukune with ease, she was swiftly defeated by Inner Moka. In the anime, Keito is in charge of a rival \"Super Newspaper Club\" which would have replaced the current one, and had three underlings who were former leaders of clubs she and the PSC disbanded placed under her control by her venom. In both adaptations, this action would later spark a conflict between the Protection Committee and the Newspaper Club.",
