  "description" : "Fritz Stanford is the Captain (Sturmhauptführer/Scharführer) of the Nazi boat that is sent to obtain the World War II painting in the sunken U-boat. He is a physically huge man, and is filled with blind faith and overconfidence (Though, at the beginning of episode six he does display a sense of puzzlement as to whether it was necessary to sacrifice so many resources in retrieving the painting). In the end, it is this overconfidence that gets him killed when he brags about his weapon and threatens Revy (as she slowly reloads her weapon), who shoots him in the chest and then point blank in the head, mostly just to shut him up. He wields a large gold Luger chambered for the .454 Casull cartridge.",
