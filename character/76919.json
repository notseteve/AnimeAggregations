  "description" : "Jessie was asked to trade Jessie`s Pumpkaboo so that the prince could wed her. Despite initial hesitation, Jessie agreed and traded her Bakeccha for Pump`s Kucheat because he told her that it is a Pok√©mon reported to mega evolve. During the trade process, Jessie`s Pumpkaboo evolved into Jessie`s Gourgeist. Pump then realized that Pumpjin is a trade evolution and the prince liked the way Bakeccha looked better so the trade was nullified and Pump`s Mawile stayed in his possession.",
