  "description" : "Stephan`s Sawk was revealed in the second round of the Don George Battle Tournament in Raimon Town. Stephan`s Sawk battled against Iris`s Emolga but Emonga`s Static ability proved to be the deciding factor in the match. The Static ability ended up paralyzing Stephan`s Sawk and it was then a sitting target for Iris`s Emolga`s Volt Switch which knocked it out. Stephan`s Sawk loss eliminated Stephan from the tournament.",
