  "description" : "Borma is http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9]`s resident explosives specialist, as shown several times during http://anidb.net/a1176 [2nd GIG]. He is the only Section 9 operative with similar height and enhanced strength to http://anidb.net/ch1584 [Batou]. He also has optical implant eyes of a similar general design to Batou`s, though his optics are a different colour and might be another model with different capabilities. Both his eyes and his baldness are his trademark features.\nIn addition to his role as Section 9`s explosives specialist, Borma often handles the task of rear support. In most assignments, he`s the only member to carry heavy weaponry. He also works as the team`s resident cyberviral warfare expert, often developing vaccines for viruses within minutes of their creation. He is usually teamed with either http://anidb.net/ch1602 [Saito] for sniping duties, http://anidb.net/ch1647 [Pazu] for general operations and http://anidb.net/ch1597 [Ishikawa] for cyberweb research and viral warfare.\nOf his past, little is known though some can be guessed from speculation and comments made in the series. At one point, Borma was in the JSDF as a demolitions expert, possibly hinting that he was either a combat engineer or a special forces operative. It`s also been speculated that he was a \"virgin\" at the time of his cyberization since he was affected by the Individual Eleven virus.",
