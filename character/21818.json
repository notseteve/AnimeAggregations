  "description" : "Martina Crespi is the daughter of a wealthy family from southern Romagna. Bright and sociable, but far too perky for a lady from a prominent family, which causes no end of headaches for her parents. Her speech and behavior is almost like that of a young boy.\nWith training in classical ballet, she has a very flexible body and a keen sense of movement. Her favored tactic consists of extremely close range dogfighting with the enemy craft. There was even an unusual case on her record in which she used her striker to \"kick out\" the core from an enemy. A downside of this is that she can sometimes be too fixated on an enemy in front of her, losing sight of the bigger picture.\nHas a somewhat love-hate relationship with Fernandia. Attached to Luciana.\nSpecializes in hit-and-run tactics in the team.",
