Ash challenged him to a battle, but was defeated, ultimately making him A.J.`s 99th victory. After discovering A.J.`s vigorous training routine, Ash criticized A.J.`s methods. Brock and Misty, however, were impressed with the strength of his Pokémon.\nWhen A.J.`s Sandshrew was stolen by Team Rocket, A.J. and the others went looking for it. After finding Team Rocket, he challenged them to a battle where he earned his 100th win. With this victory, A.J. felt ready to finally start travelling in attempts to becoming a Pokémon master.",
