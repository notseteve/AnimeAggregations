  "description" : "Mipple is the Princess of Hope from the Garden of Light. She, like Honoka, is generally more reserved than her male counterpart. She`s always sticking up for Porun, though, once he comes on the scene, and that tends to cause problems between her and Mepple. She resides predominantly with Honoka and ends all her sentences with the word \"mipo\".",
