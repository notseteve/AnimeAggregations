  "description" : "Aya is one of the top students in Ran`s class, but she was secretly doing enjo kousai to earn money (only announced in the first chapter and episode), since her parents were very stringent about her being in number one in academics and wouldn`t let her do any part-time jobs. Ran found out and confronted her about it, making her realize that she was doing the wrong thing (she insists she never \"did it\" with anybody) and, since then, Aya became good friends with Ran and Miyu. She is a shy but honest and studious individual who enjoys academics while also longing for excitement every now and then, which is thankfully provided by Ran.",
