  "description" : "Anissina is an inventor and is also Gwendal`s childhood friend. She often uses him to test out her inventions and it is for this reason that Gwendal seems to fear Anissina. When Gwendal is not around, GÃ¼nter becomes her test subject. She is also the one who taught Gwendal, and later Greta, how to knit.\nIf the men are away from the castle, it is usually Anissina who takes control. When she does so, her inventions are usually seen everywhere. The names of her inventions often end in `kun`, and usually state what they are supposed to do. Her inventions often require the use of maryoku (a kind of magic) and they actually do more harm than good.\nAside from her inventions, she spends her time writing adventure story books involving herself as a super-heroine figure. These also usually keep Greta entertained, though Yuuri and Wolfram often doubt whether they are even appropriate for children.",
