  "description" : "The Rentenberg Fortress was a fusion-powered http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Imperial] fortress. During the Imperial Civil War, it was initially occupied by the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League], but it ultimately fell to forces commanded by Marquis http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm].\nRentenberg was partly built on and into an irregular roughly kidney-shaped asteroid. Although it had a dome-like metallic area on one side, there was no indication of a main gun on the same scale as the Vulture`s Claw and the Thor Hammer of the http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersburg] and http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn] fortresses respectively. Internally, the fortress consisted of numerous passageways tunneled into the asteroid interspersed with a few larger chambers.\nThe fortress had banks of beam turrets in retractable mountings. Due to the irregular shape of the asteroid, there were blind spots in the coverage that were exploited by Admirals http://anidb.net/ch193 [Mittermeyer] and http://anidb.net/ch194 [Reuenthal] to reach service passageways that led to the main fusion reactor powering the whole fortress.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
