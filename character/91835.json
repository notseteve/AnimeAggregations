  "description" : "Nico is a young commoner boy and the younger brother of Toma. Typical of a young boy, he is very curious and wanders off to explore. He has a fascination with fairies, much to the frustration of his brother, and isn`t afraid in the slightest when a flying monster swoops over him and his brother`s friends. In fact, Nico appears to be excited and eager to approach the monster, a testament to his childish curiosity and naive bravery.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
