  "description" : "Kogure Kiminobu is Shohoku`s vice-captain and a good friend to Akagi and Mitsui. He and Akagi are the only two players who have been on the team for all three years - Mitsui left during their first year, while other players quit the team because they found Akagi`s training regimen to be too strenuous. Along with Miyagi and Ayako, he always tries to bring out the most of Hanamichi`s talent.\nSource: wikipedia",
