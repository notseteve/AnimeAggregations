  "description" : "Buzzwole is a dual-type Bug/Fighting Pokémon.\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nIt is one of the Ultra Beasts and is known by the code name UB-02 Absorption.\nBuzzwole is an Ultra Beast that resembles a large, red, anthropomorphic mosquito. It has bulging muscles that appear to be made out of sacs that are filled with a red fluid that has small white bubbles rising in it. These muscles also have white \"veins\" running through them, and are said to be stronger than steel. There are also black spikes on Buzzwole`s body, particularly its shoulders, elbows and knees. Its head is small and flat, has two black eyes which are touching each other, and coming out from between the eyes is a long, silver proboscis, which is said to be as hard as diamond. Coming out of the eyes are antennae which have black and red spikes. It has four legs without feet and two pairs of orange, translucent wings.\nAccording to the Aether Foundation, its most notable feature is its ability to strengthen itself. By absorbing the energy of its foes, it triggers a chemical reaction within its body fluids that causes its muscles to grow at explosive rates. For unknown reasons, Buzzwole appears to strike bodybuilding poses before it performs any sort of action; this is thought to be its main form of communication, but what it could be trying to communicate is not understood.",
