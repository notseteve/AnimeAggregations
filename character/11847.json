  "description" : "An only girl in the Konoe family, she lives with her father and five brothers. Her childhood dream is to be an Olympian. Her father who deeply believes in her, advised her that everything is possible if one works hard. Although she never won in tournaments, she continued working hard. Determined that she can be an Olympian, she paid no attention to those who wanted her to quit. She strives so hard that the power inside her is too much for her to handle. She broke the record of an olympian (Hayes), and others instead of being proud of her spread various rumors. She was disqualified, because her record is not acceptable. Since then, she wanted to quit school and work instead.\nAEGIS discovered her and tried to recruit her. She refused their offer and she only went to the base only to test her skills. She did not believe in Invaders because they are just unrealistic stories for her. For her, unrealistic stories are only dreams.\nShun challenged her to a kendo match and if he wins, she joins. But after 21 matches, Kaoru wins and Shun is already worn out. She has not changed her decision, so she heads home. On her way home, she encountered real Invaders with her own eyes. She saved children that were almost killed by them. She realized how powerful the Invaders are. When she was not about to handle their power, Shun and Ruriko came to her rescue. When it was Shun`s turn to be crushed, Kaoru caught them and saved Shun. Shun destroyed them and praised Kaoru for what she did. It was the first time that she heard a praise for her hard work. Since then, she joined the Gate Keepers and her dreams were fulfilled, not as an Olympian but as an earth defender.",
