  "description" : "Previously known as the Black Knight, Berserker is a Servant who possesses the ability to use practically any object as a Noble Phantasm, allowing him to match Gilgamesh in combat. His madness has reduced him to a mindless, though dangerously skilled, fighter. Despite his insanity, he is still able to instinctively recognize Saber. When Saber finally learns Berserker`s true identity, she is devastated that her decisions in life and her adherence to chivalry had caused her friend such suffering even after dying. He possesses three Noble Phantasms, the first of which is For Someone`s Glory: Not For One`s Own Glory, which envelopes him in a black fog that makes his outline blurred and his status unreadable to other Masters. By use of a Command Spell, it is possible to use the fog to allow Berserker to mimic another`s appearance, although it is noted that had Lancelot been summoned under a different Class, he would be able to freely disguise at will. Knight of Honor: A Knight Does Not Die with Empty Hands, allows him to turn anything he recognizes as a weapon, into a D- ranked Noble Phantasm. If he grabs hold of others` Noble Phantasms, he claims them temporarily as his own and their original rank is retained. His last Noble Phantasm, Arondight: The Unfading Light of the Lake is a magical sword which, when drawn, dispels For Someone`s Glory and Knight of Honour, boosts all his parameters and grants him additional prowess against beings with a `dragon` attribute such as this war`s Saber.\nSource: Wikipedia",
