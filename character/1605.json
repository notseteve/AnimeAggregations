  "description" : "A union whose territory encompasses the Australian continent and its neighboring nations. Since it wasn`t one of the sponsor nations that profited from the economic exploitation of the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs], the Oceania Union was quick to ally itself with them as tensions increased between the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs] and their terrestrial sponsors. In C.E. 68 the Oceania Union agreed to covertly exchange shipments of food and manufactured goods with the PLANTs, and on February 20, C.E. 70, it formally declared its support for the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs] in their struggle against the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance]. The Oceania Union went on to host the Carpentaria Base, http://anidb.net/ch1509 [ZAFT`s] first terrestrial stronghold.",
