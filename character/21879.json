  "description" : "Mamezou is Zakuro`s artifact spirit who appears as a sandy colored rabbit with fangs. He is able to talk. However, when Bonbori and Hoozuki first arrived at the house, he only repeated everything he heard. When Zakuro refuses to work with Agemaki, Mamezou acts as Agemaki`s partner instead. Mamezou provides Zakuro a branch of cherry blossoms which can be used as a knife by pulling one out of his mouth.\nSource: Wiki",
