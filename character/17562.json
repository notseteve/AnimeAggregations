  "description" : "Pico is a blonde pre-adolescent boy who works part-time at his http://anidb.net/ch18211 [grandfather]`s bar in the summer. He`s often shown swimming, usually naked or in a blue speedo. He wears girls` clothing after http://anidb.net/ch18210 [Mokkun] suggests it. Later, hurt that Tamotsu wouldn`t define their relationship, he rebels by cutting off most of his hair and runs away. The following summer, he spots http://anidb.net/ch18206 [Chico] swimming nude in a stream while cycling. He soon befriends the other boy, who calls him \"oniichan\" and forms a sexual relationship with him. In his relationships with both Mokkun and Chico, he is the uke, though the latter is somewhat reversible.\nSource: Wikipedia",
