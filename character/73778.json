  "description" : "Lyu was born in an elven village deep inside a forest. However she was disgusted by the attitude of elves towards other races and left the village to reach Ontario a city full of opportunity. In the city she made friends with a female adventure that invited her to join Asteria familia, and also that she would call her Lyon since Lyu was to hard to say.\nLyu reached level 4 and specialised in using wind magic and sword fighting. She has a unique fighting technique that permits her to chant long spells while sword fighting. This style requires an enormous amount of concentration and Makoto even suggested that not even Aiz would be able to replicate such a feat. Her sword is made out of wood of a sacred tree.\nLater Lyon solo survived the destruction of Astrea Familia during an ambush by an enemy famila, she asked her familia goddess to leave Ontario for her protection, however this was only an excuse since she didn`t want her goddess to witnessing her revenge.\nShe took revenge by killing every member of the rival familia and anyone connected with them resulting in the guild offering a bounty on her head.\nAfter her revenge Lyon had no place to go, exhausted and injured was later saved by Syr, which asked her to join her in the staff of the Benevolent Mistress as a waitress. And changed back her name to Lyu.\nLyu sees Syr as her saviour and is totally dedicated in protecting her and helping her in her relationship with Bell.",
