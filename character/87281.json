  "description" : "Shindou Koujirou is a highly skilled negotiator working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is the only person involuntarily induced with a sense of the anisotropic because he was the first person to exit the Kado when at that time, information about humanity had not been fully processed by the Kado. After meeting http://anidb.net/ch87269 [Yaha-kui Zashunina], he resigned from his current position and became the negotiator for the anisotropic. He treats Yaha-kui Zashunina as a normal human and is open to the devices Zashunina has introduced to humanity but is later convinced otherwise by http://anidb.net/ch87274 [Saraka].\nSource: Wikipedia",
