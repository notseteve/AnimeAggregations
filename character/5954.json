  "description" : "Nouhime (濃姫) also Kichou (帰蝶) or Lady/Princess Nou, was the wife of Oda Nobunaga, a major daimyo during the Sengoku period of Japanese history. Her proper name was Kichou, but since she came from Mino Province, she is most commonly referred to as Nou-hime (Princess of Mino). She was renowned for her beauty and cleverness.\nNou-hime`s father was the daimyo Saitou Dousan and her mother was known as Omi no Kata. Nou-hime herself appears very little in any historical record, and there is not a lot of information on the dates of her birth or death; however, proposed dates for her birth fall between 1533 - 1535.",
