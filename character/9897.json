  "description" : "Mitsuki is the younger sister of Sawatari Izumi, the series` main idol. Her aim in the show seems to be quite simple - to get as much fun as possible out of everyday life. That`s why she produces ideas of different (usually wacky) contests, which involve Izumi either as a participant, or as the prize. Mitsuki is quite popular, it`s even mentioned, that she would cost a lot more, then Yoshitaka`s whole mansion. She often acts indifferently innocent, which resembles her mother`s behaviour; when it comes to Pochi, however, she becomes overprotective.",
