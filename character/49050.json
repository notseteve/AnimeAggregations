  "description" : "Nearly identical to the television series version, the Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class Fleet Command Battleship is featured with a slightly different color scheme in the film http://anidb.net/a996 [Do You Remember Love?]. The other significant difference seen in the film version of the Battleship is a ship-length heavy converging beam cannon similar to the http://anidb.net/ch48996 [Quiltra-Quelamitz] Class Gunboat. The Nupetiet-Vergnitzs main gun activates by lifting the dorsal hull and dropping the ventral hull (nearly opening the entire ship from stem to stern) and thus acts as a collimator for super dimension energy to collect and fire forward. In Space War I, Commander http://anidb.net/ch49046 [Vrlitwhai] used this powerful weapon to blast a large hole through the hull of the Bodol Zer Mobile Fortress, allowing the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] to fly into the ship and attack Gorg Bodolzaa directly.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/nupetiet-vergnitzs-dyrl.htm",
