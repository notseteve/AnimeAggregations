  "description" : "Born Jinto Lynn on planet Martine (spelt as Martinh in Baronh) of the Hyde star system (Haïdec in Baronh), he was the son of Rock Lynn, a politician who eventually became president of the Hyde star system. It was during his administration that the Abh empire was able to annex the Hyde stellar system into its territory through an invasion. Making his own ideas more valuable than the rights of the people of Martine, Rock Lin made a deal with the leaders of the invading forces that the territorial lord of Hyde shall be chosen amongst the people of Martine. The leader of the invading forces agreed to this however this meant that an election cannot be held making Rock, as the current leader of Martine, the natural choice to become its territorial lord. Because of this, Rock Lynn, and with him, Jinto, rose to the ranks of Abh nobility as Count of Haïdec.",
