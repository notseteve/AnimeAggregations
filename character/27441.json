  "description" : "Mienshao, known as the Martial Arts Pokémon, is a Fighting-type Pokémon & the evolution of Mienfoo. Like its pre-evolution, it is based on a Mustelid, doing Whip fighting, Taekwondo and Kokondo. It is Black in color & has a long body. Its head is small in size and has small, triangle shaped ears. Its forehead has a purple spot adorning it as well as a yellow one on its snout. It possesses a pair of long, yellow tipped whiskers which have split ends. Its arms are almost completely covered by a large amount of fur that is tipped in purple and split at the end. This arm fur is used as a weapon in battle and acts like a battle whip. Its torso has one purple ring of fur around its midsection. It also has purple fur on the bottom section of the torso, which resemble pants, and its bottom paws are clawed. It has a long, skinny tail that, like its paw fur, is tipped purple and split at its end.",
