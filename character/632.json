  "description" : "Sneasel is a nocturnal weasel that lives in mountain forests. Sneasel is a deep blue-gray and has a golden jewel on its forehead and chest, and its claws are white. These claws are dangerously sharp, extremely durable, and are used for attacking. It hunts under the cover of chilly darkness, which allows it to sneak up on foes or lost prey. It also steals and eats eggs from nests. If the nest is guarded by a parent Pokémon, Sneasel scares the Pokémon away. It evolves into Weavile by leveling it up with Razor Claw at night.",
