  "description" : "Fukuzawa Yousuke is a 3rd year student and the captain of the schools cycling club and is a bit of a fanatic when it comes to it. Like http://anidb.net/ch13760 [his sister] he also likes to play tricks on people but mostly to http://anidb.net/ch6574 [Mikoto]. One example is when Koichi explained why cyclists need to shave their legs and when Mikoto said he wanted to do the same Yosuke shaved them but along with his pubic hair as well. Has been bicycle racing since his early childhood, though not very much liked by his teammates as no one was able to keep up with him. The exception being his friend Kouichi. Both Yousuke and Kouichi ended up leaving the cycling club and later on started their own. He excels in downhill racing.",
