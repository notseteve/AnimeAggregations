  "description" : "This transformable mobile armour, an improved version of the original Psyco Gundam, is theoretically the most powerful mobile weapon in the entire Earth Sphere. However, the Psyco Gundam Mk.II enters battle in an incomplete state, unable to transform into its \"mobile fortress\" form or deploy its full range of fighting capabilities, and its performance is further hampered by the mental instability of its pilot. In theory, the Psyco Gundam Mk.II can deploy remote-controlled \"reflector bits\" to redirect its beam fire towards its targets, and the beam swords in its wire-guided detachable forearms make it equally dangerous in close combat.",
