  "description" : "A first year student who looks up to thugs and gangs and wants to become a delinquent himself. He deeply admires Oga as the best hoodlum around and their first contact is when Oga and Kunieda save him and his friend Azusa from harassment by Teimou students. He then kowtows to Oga and begs to become his underling. After some insistence and flattery, Oga ends up accepting his company. He also admires Furuichi, to the latter`s delight, calling him \"general Furuichi\", for being the only man able to follow Oga. His plot role so far has been mostly comic relief and as an information source on the Six Knights.",
