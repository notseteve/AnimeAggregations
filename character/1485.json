  "description" : "Erina joins the Nadesico at the same time as Nagare and proves to be just as irritating to the other characters. Her official post is co-helmswoman, but she ends up pushing orders onto everyone around and even the captain. She is quite fascinated by Akito because of his boson jumping abilities and constantly nags him to become a guinea pig for her experiments.",
