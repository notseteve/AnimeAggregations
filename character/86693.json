  "description" : "Mudbray is a Ground-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Mudsdale starting at level 30.\nMudbray is a quadruped, equine Pokémon resembling a small donkey. It has a dark brown coat with a cream-colored underbelly, muzzle, and circular markings on each cheek. A short, teardrop-shaped blaze extends up from its muzzle, and it has long, pointed ears with pink insides. Its large eyes have horizontal pupils. Black bangs hang over its face before turning into a stiff mane along its neck. Additionally, it has a short, black tail. Thick, cream-colored mud surrounds each black hoof.\nBecause it was hunted nearly to extinction when it lived all over the world, it is believed to run wild only in Alola. This Pokémon boasts immense strength for its size, and is able to drag or carry loads up to 50 times its own weight. If Mudbray has a place where it can frolic in the mud, it is happy. However, it becomes stressed and may become disobedient if denied this pastime.",
