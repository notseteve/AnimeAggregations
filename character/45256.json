  "description" : "As Neo Zeon launches its invasion of Earth during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, they employ several new mobile suit designs built for terrestrial combat. One of these units is the AMX-109 Capule, which is an amphibious mobile suit based loosely on the old Principality of Zeon`s MSM-03 Gogg from the One Year War. Armed with eight missile launchers, a sonic blast weapon in its waist, and a laser beam \"eye\" on its small, flat head, this small mobile suit packs an enormous amount of firepower for its size, all cooled by a hydro-cooling system. The Capule`s arms can fold up inside its main body and its legs can fold back, turning the mobile suit into a mobile armor-like form that is faster and more streamlined when moving underwater. In its mobile armor mode, the Capule can also move along the water`s surface in a fashion similar to a hovercraft. However, the Capule seems to have lost many of the lessons learned by the Principality of Zeon during its amphibious mobile suit development during the One Year War. As a result, the Capule proves to be an inefficient design and is highly unpopular with its pilots - apparently Spacenoids have forgotten how to build ocean-going mobile suits for use on Earth. The Capule remains in use with Zeon remnants and participates in attacks on the Federation capital Dakar and Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.\nSource: mahq.net",
