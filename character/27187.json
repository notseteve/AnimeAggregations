  "description" : "Sandile, known as the Desert Croc Pokémon, is a mainly tan colored crocodile-like Pokémon with a pink underbelly, black stripes, and black rimmed eyes. To prevent their body temperature from dropping, they bury in the sands of the desert, akin to some real desert dwelling species. It moves along below the sand`s surface, with its nose and eyes sticking out. The dark membrane in its eyes shields them from the sun.\nIn the anime, a group of Sandile appeared in A Sandile Gusher of Change!, trying to lead a bunch of Pokémon to safety. The leader of the group, which has a pair of sunglasses, has since become a reoccurring character, and evolves into a Krokorok. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, a Sandile is one of the Pokémon employed by White in her BW Agency.",
