  "description" : "Croconaw is the evolution of Totodile. It opens its huge jaws wide when attacking. If it loses any fangs while biting, new ones will quickly grow back in its place so that it always has 48 fangs. The tips of these fangs are slanted backward. Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go. Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in. This means that the prey has no hope of escape. The pattern on Croconaw`s belly vaguely resembles a jungle tunic or loincloth. Croconaw live in or around swamps. When they evolve into Feraligatr, they move into an area where there is a waterfall.",
