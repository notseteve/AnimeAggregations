He was unemployed and running wild 10 years in the past from the day Ash Ketchum and friends visited the hotel. He was the owner of the hotel as he won a Pok√©mon battle in the past against Yolton. He made a deal with Yolton that if he lost the battle he`d stop bugging him and his customers but in return, Yolton would give up his hotels ownership, which he ended up doing. Yolton then became the hotel receptionist under Mantle.\nAsh Ketchum and his friends travel back in time 10 years with the help of Yolton`s Rotom. They changed the past and created a new alternate future where Yolton was able to defeat Mantle in the battle and keep the ownership of the hotel. He then hired Mantle to work at his hotel.",
