  "description" : "An agent of the all-female \"Nine Number Group\", one of the ten groups in the \"Zero Zero Organization\", a Western Bloc intelligence organization. Almost her entire body has been cybernetized, and various parts of her body are equipped with special functions which are necessary for spy activity. Besides her standard weapon, which is a ray gun, the WA-P009 (commonly called a plasma gun), she also wears earring communicators, boots with a hidden needle gun, and other agent gear. Her most secret pieces of equipment are her 9 mm bust machine guns, which have been made into a part of her body and fire bio-bullets. Built into both of her breasts, they have enough power to turn the target into Swiss cheese. Various secret equipment has been installed and modifications done, but her physical abilities were high to begin with, and she also has a clear mind. Together, all of this makes her the single most outstanding agent in the Zero Zero Organization.",
