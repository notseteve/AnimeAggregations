  "description" : "Watchog, known as the Precaution Pok√©mon, is the evolved form of Patrat. It attacks by hurling the seeds of berries collected in its cheek sacs. When it spots an enemy it stands its tail erect. It makes the patterns on its body shine in order to intimidate enemies. It has eyes that can see its surroundings even in the dark.\nIn the anime, Nacrene City Gym Leader Lenora has a Watchog and she uses it in \"A Night in the Nacrene City Museum!!\" where it used its ability to reveal Yamask`s presence. She then uses it against Ash in his Gym Battle in \"The Battle Acconding to Lenora\" where it defeats his Oshawott with Thunderbolt. It appears once more in \"Rematch at the Nacrene Gym!\", where it is defeated by Oshawott`s Aqua Jet.\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava described Watchog as a \"pissed-off meerkat\", and further calling it a \"disgruntled-looking jerk\". An editor for GamesRadar included it in a satirical character battle between their \"ultimate hated characters\".",
