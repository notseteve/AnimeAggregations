  "description" : "Candice is the Gym Leader of the Snowpoint Gym.\nCandice attended Zoey`s contest in Mecabbage Town, where she was joined by Ash, Dawn and Brock who were also there for the same reason. Her cheering encouraged Zoey to do her best in the last battle of the Mecabbage Town Pok√©mon Contest, where Zoey`s Glameow was facing a Shuckle with powerful defenses. After winning the battle and earning her fifth ribbon, Zoey thanked Candice for her encouragement. She later threw a big party to celebrate Zoey`s victory.\nThe day after the contest, Candice and Zoey helped Dawn to come up with a new contest combination that could be used as a finishing move for a double contest battle. She gave Dawn an idea on how to use her Mamoswine`s Ice Shard attack more effectively by demonstrating a beautiful Ice Shard and Razor Leaf combination using her Abomasnow.",
