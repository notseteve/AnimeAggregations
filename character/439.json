  "description" : "Since Electabuzz is electric, he feeds on electrical currents. Its methods of securing its food vary: during thunderstorms, an Electabuzz climbs to the highest place possible, in hopes that it will be struck by lightning. As a result, many towns in the Pokémon world employ an Electabuzz in lieu of a lightning rod. Electabuzz also lurk around power plants, feeding off the electricity generated there. This behavior is dangerous to the public, as occasionally blackouts are caused by an Electabuzz overindulging itself at a power plant, or worse, walking down to a city and drawing electricity from there.\nDue to its unique diet, Electabuzz`s body is constantly discharging stored electricity, to the point that it glows whitish blue in darkness and static electricity effects manifest. An Electabuzz can control the electric current coursing in its body to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon, especially with another Electabuzz. It originally is lone in its evolutionary line, but it gains a previous form, Elekid, in Pokémon Gold and Silver, and an evolution, Electivire, in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl.\nLike Scyther, as seen in the anime, Electabuzz is most likely provoked by the color red.",
