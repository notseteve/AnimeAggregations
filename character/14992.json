  "description" : "Ryuichi`s former manager and now the manager for Bad Luck, K is aggressive in promoting the band--he even carries around a big gun and hand grenades. His concern is first and foremost Bad Luck, but in his shaping of the band`s career, he ends up involving himself in Eiri and Shuichi`s relationship. He is American, and in the original Japanese version, they played on the stereotype that Americans always have guns and will pull them out any time, any place. K often speaks English mixed in with his Japanese. K`s real name is Claude K. Winchester. Also in the manga it is shown that K has a family; he has a wife named Judy Winchester, and a son named Michael Winchester.",
