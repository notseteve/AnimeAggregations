  "description" : "The older brother of Sakura, and an old friend of Shirou. The son of Byakuya Matou. Although chauvinistic and narcissistic, Shinji is very popular as Vice-Captain of the Archery Dojo. Like Rin, he is of a distinguished lineage of sorcerers, though the Matou blood has thinned and no longer produces heirs naturally capable of sorcery. Shinji feels uncomfortable with his sister`s daily visits to Shirou`s home. He has an open crush on Rin, but she does not return his favours.",
