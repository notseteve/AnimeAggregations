  "description" : "Frequently appearing to be lethargic and unmotivated, Ryner is the protagonist of the story. He has black eyes and hair and is of slender build; is naturally talented in magic, hand-to-hand combat, arts of assassination, ancient texts, languages and symbols, and the bearer of Alpha Stigma (複写眼, アルファ・スティグマ?), an ocular ability which grants him the ability to analyse various forms of magic. Although the Alpha Stigma are the weakest and most common type of \"cursed\" eyes, Ryner`s eyes are no ordinary Alpha Stigmas.\nRyner is also known as \"The Strongest Mage of Roland\", after defeating another mage who previously held that title. He is regarded as an anomaly because he is the only person to have been able to regain his sanity after losing control of his Alpha Stigma. He is also 1/2 of the reincarnation of the legendary demon lord know as \"The Lonely One\".\nHas a tendency to distance himself from others because he does not wish to cause harm and grief to others due to his eyes and vice versa. Has caused multiple girls throughout his life to fall in love with him, though he is reluctant to love again after his first love sacrificed herself to save him.",
