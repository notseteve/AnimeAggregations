  "description" : "Nerv and Gehirn`s secret backers, who wish to implement the Human Instrumentality Project, and arguably the \"true villains\" of the series. It consists of at least twelve prominent people; five of them form the Instrumentality Committee, which directly oversees Nerv`s progress, officially in the name of the UN. Its members are referred to as the \"Old Men.\"\nSeele is a secret organisation, the real puppetmasters behind the United Nations. Its origins are shrouded in mystery; they would claim to have existed since ancient times, functioning as an Illuminati-like power cabal over most of the world`s governments. This cannot be verified, but they have been operating since at least soon after World War II, when they acquired the secret sections of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The secret Dead Sea Scrolls predicted the arrival of the Angels and of Third Impact, and Seele began striving to develop means to defeat the Angels so that a human-centred Instrumentality process would proceed. Having decided that humanity as a whole had reached an evolutionary dead end, Seele seeks to bring about Instrumentality and unite all humans into one hyper-being, the next stage of existence.\nIn German \"Seele\" means \"soul\".",
