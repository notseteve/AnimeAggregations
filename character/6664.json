  "description" : "Unlike previous mobile suits, which could fight in mid-air only by making brief rocket-assisted jumps, this transformable mobile armour is capable of sustained atmospheric flight. The Asshimar`s transformation mechanisms are treated with performance-enhancing magnet coating, enabling it to switch from mobile suit to saucer-shaped mobile armour form within half a second, and thus making possible all kinds of novel aerial combat tactics. After proving its worth in the hands of test pilot Buran Blutarch of the Oakland Newtype Lab, the Asshimar enters full production and is posted to key areas like the Earth Federation capital in Dakar.",
