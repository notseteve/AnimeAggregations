  "description" : "First deployed in 1995, the Strike Eagle is a heavily refurbished F-15 Eagle with increased armament capabilities, improved avionics, composite armour, and other enhancements. This variant has inherited the title of \"the strongest second-generation machine\" and has kept the title up till today.\nAlthough its appearance is nearly identical to the previous F-15C, the Strike Eagle`s performance is closer to that of an all-new 2.5th generation TSF in no small part thanks to a complete overhaul of its internal components; this enables it new options in combat, one of which is to purge its knee-mounted weapons container once empty to reduce weight. Against combat with other TSFs, it is worth noting that the F-15E is capable of matching up against the Type-94 Shiranui.\nEven with the introduction of third-generation TSFs, the reliability, extensive development, and supply of replacement parts maintain the Eagle`s leading position on the TSF market 20 years after its initial introduction. With the introduction of the US` next generation F-22A Raptor delayed, further upgrades for the F-15 are pursued.\nSource: Muv Luv Wiki",
