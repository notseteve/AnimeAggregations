  "description" : "Pupitar is a pupa stage in the process of Larvitar evolving into Tyranitar. Though it is in a shell, it already has developed arms and legs under it. This allows it to thrash about, and have a lot of mobility. This mobility is heightened by it creating a special pressurized gas that can be released to propel itself at high speeds. Using the bedrock toughness of its shell and its natural strength, it can easily topple mountains, and withstand an impact with solid steel.",
