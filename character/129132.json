  "description" : "Ash`s Gengar has a previous Trainer three years prior to Ash Ketchum catching it. They ran into each other while Ash`s Gengar was attached to Ash Ketchum`s shadow. He got rid of Gengar because he was very unlucky. He couldn`t win a battle, and every Pok√©mon he tried to catch would get away. He also would fall down the steps and he`d lose things all the time. He blamed all these mishaps on Gengar`s curse. He left Gengar at the building that years later would become the Cerise Laboratory. Since then, he thinks his luck had changed without Gengar.",
