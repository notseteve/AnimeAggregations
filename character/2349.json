  "description" : "Kanroji Nanami is a student in year one of class three who is a member of the girl`s basketball team, attending the school on an athletic scholarship.\nA mostly interpersonal character, Nanami is a mature and somewhat quiet individual who really never involves herself with the affairs of others and as such remains for the most part unanalysed. She is the only girl of the main cast to have an established boyfriend from the start, a member of the basketball club named Kyoichi; though to her chagrin he is more of a devout otaku.\nNanami is good friends with http://anidb.net/ch2346 [Sekai], who comes from her junior high school, and http://anidb.net/ch2350 [Katou Otome]. Of the entire cast Nanami is the tallest character.",
