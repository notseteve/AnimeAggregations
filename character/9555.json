  "description" : "The Fifth Neck, she is an antisocial mangaka of few words. Reiko continues her \"day job\" as a member of the Orochi and has in fact done better on the market since joining, though her manga have taken on very dark themes since then. She barely interacts with the other Orochi and is stone-cold in battle, though her level-headedness is more the product of cynicism and numbness than Miyako`s.\nHer mecha, Ho no Shuraizuchi, takes on the forms of a Joumon-style (straw-rope pattern) fired pottery jar and an anthropoid shape.\nIn personal combat, Reiko throws fountain pens at her targets. Like Corona`s lipsticks, these apparently carry a kinetic charge capable of causing explosions.\nInterestingly, Himeko adores Reiko`s work and is apparently an avid reader of hers.\nThere is some indication that she carries the mark of Orochi on her back.",
