  "description" : "Kusuda is a pervy friend of http://anidb.net/ch6561 [Mamoru]`s. His talent is putting girls to sleep with stupid puns. He doesn`t see much in http://anidb.net/ch6556 [Ayumi], but he is very interested in http://anidb.net/ch6567 [Misaki]; he is nearly obsessed with her. He seems undaunted by http://anidb.net/ch6557 [Kei]`s good looks, and with his \"Kappa\" face, they tend to bicker a lot. He runs away from home with Mamoru and http://anidb.net/ch6564 [Sogabe] because he regrets saying he hates Kei.",
