  "description" : "Tama is a white tiger from Africa, who was rescued by http://anidb.net/ch528 [Nagi] as a cub, and was raised on Matsuzaka beef and expensive tuna fish, making it incapable for him to go to the zoo or back to the wild. He can speak the human language, though he does not reveal this to http://anidb.net/ch529 [Maria] or Nagi because he doesn`t want to shatter the young girl`s dreams. He will lay his life down to protect Nagi, because his situation was a lot like http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate]`s. To him, Maria is the highest power there is, followed by an impassable wall, Nagi, then himself, and everyone else is below him.",
