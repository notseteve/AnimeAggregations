  "description" : "Red XIII, real name Nanaki, is a red lion-like beast that serves as one of the playable characters in Final Fantasy VII. Red XIII was the name he received as a specimen designation while held captive and experimented upon by Professor Hojo. Even though he is 48 in human years, his age is comparable to around 15 to 16 years old by his own species` standards. He fights alongside Cloud and his allies to fulfill his duty to the Planet to defend it as a warrior.\nFinal Fantasy VII: Advent Children:\nAt the intro, Red XIII is seen with two younger members of the species running in a barren area. And also when Edge was under attack by Bahamut SIN in 0009, he hastens there with Cait Sith on his back, and uses his claws and teeth to battle Bahamut SIN. He appears later in the film, aboard the Shera and once more in Aerith`s church. He is only given one line in the entire film, commenting on how some children still have Geostigma, and has a slight accent.\nSource: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Nanaki",
