  "description" : "An Innovator who is the genetic twin of Tieria Erde. Although he works closely with Ribbons Almark, the two do not always see eye to eye. As a result, Regene often acts of his own will to complete the plan Aeolia intended, from meeting with Tieria to leaking Veda`s location to Wang Liu Meis.\nHowever, Ribbons was a step ahead of Regene and had Ali Al-Saachez kill him when he attempted to kill Ribbons. However, Regene`s consciousness lived long enough to see Tieria use the codes he gave him in their meeting to lock Ribbons out of Veda.",
