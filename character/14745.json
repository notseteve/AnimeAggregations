He is slightly arrogant and a delivery-boy. Syrup once worked for Eternal, the villains of the sequel, because he was looking for something in the Cure Rose Garden and needed to get there. He quit for reasons currently unknown. When Syrup was younger, he worked in the Cure Rose Garden. In Eternal, he was asked to deliver a letter from Eternal`s boss to Flora.\nSyrup has amnesia and forgot who he was. He wanted to find the Cure Rose Garden so he can regain his memories.\nSyrup also develops a bond with Urara, as hinted in episodes 4, 18 and 40.",
