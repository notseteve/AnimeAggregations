  "description" : "Minagawa Motoko, aged 17-18, is the president of Souma Yuki`s fan club and a year ahead of him. As a devoted fan, she is depicted as obsessive and romantic. The fan club bans any member from being alone with their \"prince\" to keep him \"safe\" by preventing any one member from \"stealing\" him; as such, Motoko hates any girl who gets close to Yuki â€” in particular, Honda Tooru, Toudou Kimi, and Kuragi Machi. Motoko and the club vice-president, Kinoshita Minami, instigate multiple plots to undermine Tooru, including visiting Hanajima Saki, whom they see as protecting Tooru with her \"poison waves\", at home to find a weakness, and arranging to have Tooru cast as Cinderella`s wicked stepsister to make her behave badly. The few times Motoko does speak with Yuki, she gets so overwrought that all she can do is talk about banal things, such as what he had for breakfast. At her graduation, she finally confesses to Yuki that she loves him, though she knows she cannot have him, and wishes him happiness in the future.",
