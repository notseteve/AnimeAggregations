  "description" : "Scarron runs the pub Miwaku no Yousei which is similar to the modern day maid cafe with all the waitresses dressed in colouful and revealing maid uniforms. He has feminine-speech and feminine-gestures despite muscularity, and workers call him not \"master\" but \"ma madamoiselle\". He also has a tendency to call out \"Tres Bien!\". Also uncle of Siesta and surprising everyone that he is the father of Jessica (or just the fact that he is a father).",
