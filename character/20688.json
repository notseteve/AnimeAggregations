  "description" : "A very pretty and exceedingly popular girl. She loves being called beautiful by the others, especially Sunako. Noi is Sunako`s closest friend at school, where Sunako is scorned for her terrifying demeanor and association with the boys. She admires Sunako`s tough attitude and also believes that Sunako and Kyohei are compatible as a couple. Noi is in love with Takenaga, though she tends to be insecure about their relationship because Takenaga is too shy to openly admit that he likes her. She is called \"Noi\" in both the North American and Singaporean English-language translation. As stated in recent chapters, she`s a fan of shoujo manga.",
