  "description" : "Considered one of the most talented students at Doumori Elementary, Shinozaki Ai, is a sixth-grader in class 6-5, one year ahead of Nube`s class. A scion of the Shinozaki zaibatsu, she`s a beautiful girl who looks older than she really is (she`s tall and slender, and with a big bust that rivals Miki`s and Ritsuko-sensei`s), has mastery of several musical instruments including the violin and piano (in the anime, her episode happens right after she wins a violin contest), as well as fluency of three foreign languages other than Japanese.\nWikipedia",
