It`s nicknamed \"Mustache Man\" because of the face armor that resembles a mustache.\nThe Soulgain is a powerful Super Robot that uses the life energy of its pilot as a source of power to unleash vicious attacks. It`s equipped with the Direct Feedback System, which allows the pilot to control it using his own movements. It has excellent combat abilities, and is oftenly capable of destroying its enemies within one blow.\nIt was first seen fighting the Aerogators during Operation SRW, by Guilliam Yeager, but it disappeared soon after.
