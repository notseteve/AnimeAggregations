  "description" : "The Crow is http://anidb.net/ch82450 [Mozgus]` second in command and one of two members of the group who speaks, recruited by the inquisitor as a child when left to die by his family who could no longer afford his treatment.\nWhile the most normal-looking of the disciples, the Crow suffers from both a weak immune system and photo-sensitivity to the point that his skin festers from being in prolonged sunlight. Because of this, he wears a complete black bodysuit that covers his entire body. He covers his face with a crow-like plague-mask, with dark-toned glasses and a copper beak for respiratory means.\nHis torture device of choice is a man catcher, a spiked collar on a pole intended for removing a mounted soldier from his horse, and used against heretics with great efficiency.\nDuring the start of the Incarnation Ceremony, the Crow pleaded for Mozgus to escape while he and the others hold the door to chantry. He also was the only one in the room to see http://anidb.net/ch91831 [the Egg of the Perfect World] before becoming an Apostle spawn along with his comrades.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
