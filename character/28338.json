Rosenbach on Dr. Oppenheim`s orders, Dr. Becker was working on the Turkish construction worker and took too long treating him resulting in the construction worker`s death. When the Liebert Twins were brought in, he helped Dr. Tenma on Johan`s operation. After what happened with Mayor Roedecker, Dr. Becker visited Tenma asking if he had heard from Director Heinemann yet. At the time when Director Heinemann, Dr. Oppenheim, and Dr. Boyer were found dead, he, Tenma, and a nurse discovered that the Liebert Twins are gone. Following Director Heinemann`s funeral, he and Tenma were approached by Inspector Egon Weisbach and Inspector Lunge about any clues to who could`ve done this to Director Heinemann. At the time when Tenma was arrested in Prague, Dr. Becker was with some of Eisler Memorial Hospital`s patience mentioning about any doubts that a good lawyer would represent Tenma.",
