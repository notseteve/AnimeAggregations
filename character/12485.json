  "description" : "The pet ferret purchased by Tina but eventually becomes attached to the one person who initially rejected having anything to do with it, Miyabi.\nIts` arrival at the `boarding house` was predictably chaotic, with its` accidentally destructive behavior causing Miyabi to develop an intense dislike for it, partly because in the episode it is learned that the tough-as-nails Miyabi is secretly afraid of insects, and Uzume has a tendency to present them, cat-like, as presents to her.\nHer anger at this discovery of her secret vulnerability being made by the other residents is short-circuited by being the only one who can save the animal`s life when it becomes trapped and is in danger of dying.\nThe name Uzume was derived from Ame-no-Uzume, the goddess on Japanese Mythology who was responsible for luring Amaterasu out of the Heavenly Cave.\nIn later episodes, it is seen that the ferret has been accepted by Miyabi as being, for all intents and purposes, her pet. It is often seen in close proximity to her, laying or sleeping on a pillow in Miyabi`s office.",
