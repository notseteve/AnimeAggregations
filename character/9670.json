  "description" : "He is the leader of Racan, a group of young, city punks. He shows some promise as a leader, because he does not resort to violence unnecessarily and is capable of sensing the members` concerns about himself and about the group`s future. Not knowing exactly what to do, however, he leads a \"take-it-easy life\". Shinji values \"freedom\" more than anything, and because of that, he does not restrict his girlfriend Yoko`s actions, so much to the extent that he appears indifferent to her. But Shinji, who makes \"freedom\" his life`s principle, also has a longing to become part of the privileged class called \"The Class\". It seems that what he truly wants in his life is not something he can get by remaining where he is.",
