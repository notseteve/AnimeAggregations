  "description" : "The Aegis Gundam is one of four prototype Earth Alliance mobile suits captured by ZAFT. Its X300-series frame allows it to transform into a clawed mobile armour form, which can seize enemy ships and mobile suits and then destroy them with its built-in beam weapons. The Aegis is equally formidable in its mobile suit form, which carries a beam rifle and a shield with anti-beam coating. As its name suggests, the Aegis was meant to serve as a command unit, watching over the other GAT-X units in battle. After its capture, this machine is assigned to ZAFT pilot Athrun Zala.",
