  "description" : "Norimaki Arale is an android built by Norimaki Senbei, known for her naivety, energetic personality, superhuman strength, and lack of common sense. She is also nearsighted and needs to wear glasses. Senbei`s mission is to convince the other citizens of Penguin Village that Arale is no more than a typical 13-year-old girl, which they appear to believe in, despite taking notice to Arale`s numerous displays of superhuman athletic capability.\nSource: Dragon Ball Wikia",
