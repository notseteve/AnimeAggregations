  "description" : "Nerv`s Deputy Commander and Ikari Gendou`s right hand man. He does not especially like Gendou, but he is the closest thing to a confidant that Gendou has in the series.\nOnce a professor of meta-biology at Kyoto University, Fuyutsuki became interested in the research and theories undertaken by Ikari Yui, and became her sponsor and mentor. Shortly thereafter, he was directed by his superiors to initiate a similar arrangement with Rokobungi Gendou.\nLater, after the Second Impact, Fuyutsuki travelled with Gendou to the ruins of Antarctica, and began to suspect that Gendou and his associates in Seele were more powerful and dangerous than he originally realized. In 2003, Fuyutsuki discovered for himself the true nature of the events leading up to Second Impact and Seele`s involvement in initiating that catastrophe. Gendou led him into the GeoFront and Central Dogma, and asked Fuyutsuki to join him in \"creating a new future for mankind.\"",
