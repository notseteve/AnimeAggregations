  "description" : "Philippe is a young child from a wealthy family, though without a mother and father. Oz saved Philippe from some bullies, and while talking to him saw a reflection of himself in Philippe, particularly that of his father. Phillipe was then attacked by Echo, who was in pursuit of an illegal contractor. Echo took Phillipe and was about to chase after his father, the illegal contractor, and use him as a hostage. However, Oz managed to interfere with the process. Philippe`s father made an illegal contract to try to bring his wife back to life but lost control and was eventually killed by Vincent on grounds that he was about to kill Oz.\nAfter the death of his father, Philippe was taken to the Nightray`s orphanage at Sabrie. There, Oz meets him again. Oz tries to apologize for not being able to bring his father back. Philippe denies that his father is dead by saying that he has received a letter from his father. He is later seen talking on the phone with his father, although the phone cord is shown to be severed, leading one to suspect that Philippe is mentally unstable.\nSource: Wikipedia",
