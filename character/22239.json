  "description" : "After the Strike Gundam is destroyed in battle, it is salvaged and rebuilt by the engineers of Morgenroete, who later use the spare parts created during this repair process to construct a duplicate of the original mobile suit. The Strike Rouge is equipped with a power extender to increase its operating time, and as a result its colours are red-shifted when its Phase Shift Armor is activated. It also has an AI (Artificial Intelligence) support system to assist inexperienced pilots. The parts for the Strike Rouge are carried into space aboard the warship Kusanagi, and when the mobile suit is assembled it becomes Cagalli Yula Athha`s personal machine.",
