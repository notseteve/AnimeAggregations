  "description" : "Hatsuseno Alpha is a type A7M2 robot, one of only three production prototypes, who runs Café Alpha in the absence of her owner. She is cheerful, thoughtful and enjoys talking with her few customers, but is initially socially awkward and sheltered—despite being her model`s prototype, at the start of the series she has met only a few people and no other robots. Because of this, when her owner departed, she declined to travel with him. As the series progresses, however, she grows more confident in her social skills, enough so that she spends a year traveling herself, and becomes more attached to her human friends even as they age and depart. In her spare time, Alpha plays a gekkin, carves small art objects with fish designs, and travels the local countryside on her scooter, investigating the remains of humanity`s previous age and the emerging world to come.\nSource: Wikipedia",
