  "description" : "At the beginning of the Mobile Suit Gundam TV series, Sayla is a civilian of Side 7, who comes aboard the mobile suit carrier White Base along with other civilians include Amuro Ray, Fraw Bow, Hayato Kobayashi, Kai Shiden and Mirai Yashima. Sayla is a Newtype much like her brother Char Aznable.\nOriginally a medical student on Side 7, Sayla is almost immediately recruited as a soldier, and set to the task of watching over the civilian refugees. With the near total lack of experienced personnel to defend White Base (most original regular officers were KIA in Zeon`s Side 7 attack), Bright Noa assigns Sayla to the multiple positions of communications officer, medical officer, navigator, and finally combat pilot.\nSoon after joining the ship, she repeatedly looks for her brother Casval, and takes every opportunity to learn information about him and make contact. When Bright picks up a suspicious briefcase (later revealed to be full of gold bars) intended for Sayla, he confronts her and she admits that her true identity as Artesia Som Deikun, sister to Casval Rem Deikun (better known as Char Aznable), and the only daughter of Zeon Zum Deikun, the founder of the Republic of Zeon.",
