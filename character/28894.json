  "description" : "Kanou Shuugo was Mihashi`s former teammate who took the role of starting pitcher after Mihashi left and uses a forkball as a strikeout pitch. His team had said that he would have been the ace pitcher of the team if Mihashi`s grandfather, who owned the school, had not made Mihashi the starting pitcher. However, Kanou refuses to accept the notion, seeing Mihashi`s true potential as an ace pitcher and angry at how the team treated him. As such, he is the first of his team to play seriously against Nishiura in a practice game until convincing the others to as well. Kanou and Mihashi were friends during childhood and Mihashi occasionally refers to him by the nickname Shu-chan. In fact, at the last episode of season one, Kanou smiles upon hearing this and says excitedly, He`s calling me by my first name! It`s like we`re little kids again!.",
