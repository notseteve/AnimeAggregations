  "description" : "Apparently, Tsukasa saved her from falling off a cliff when they were children. Chitose wants to use her own life for the sake of Tsukasa to pay her back. She obviously doesn`t want Tsukasa falling into Nasa`s hands. She has two maids: Aurora and Charlotte. Chitose has a personality that quickly bends from being strong to whining. She considers Tsukasa her sister.\nSource: Tonikaku Kawaii Wiki",
