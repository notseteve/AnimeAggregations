  "description" : "Maho is http://anidb.net/ch21554 [Shuuichi`s] sister. She is one year older than him and in contrast to her younger brother, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuuichi, even hitting or slapping him on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuuichi with little consideration of his opinion. She does not like Shuuichi`s cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate http://anidb.net/ch23422 [Seya Riku], and eventually starts dating him.",
