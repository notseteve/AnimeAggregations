  "description" : "Asagi Kaoru is an upperclassman from http://anidb.net/ch87717 [Kurusu Kurogo]`s school and a member of the drama club. Although confused by many to be male, Kaoru is in fact a girl. Her androgynous appearance and courteous behaviour make her popular amongst other girls, even those from other schools. Kurusu tries to recruit her, much to her surprise as kabuki is usually performed by men. She eventually joins the kabuki club, performing there and in the drama club.\nSource: English Wikipedia",
