  "description" : "The elderly, white haired headmaster of the Tristain Academy of Magic is known for his lecherous behavior but is shown to have a serious side. He enjoys smoking and using his mouse familiar to find out what kind of underwear Longueville is wearing. He is also a very smart and powerful mage. Queen Henrietta finds him trustworthy. In the first season, we are told his life was saved 30 years ago by an American soldier from the Vietnam War. Seeing his rocket launcher kill a dragon, Osmond dubbed it the `Staff of Destruction.`",
