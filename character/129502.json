  "description" : "Cerah`s Ninetales is the evolved form of Cerah`s Vulpix. After Lillie crashed on her first jump, Cerah told her when she was younger, she also had a spectacular wipeout and got scared of jumping. Cerah explained that her mother wanted her to take piano lessons, but when a friend of hers entered a Pok√©mon Sled Jump competition, she half-heartedly started practicing for it. Her Vulpix helped her build the courage to try sledding again after the crash. Cerah never forgot the exhilaration she felt at that moment getting back on the sled after some coaxing from her Vulpix and by the middle of that jump, she got the sense that Vulpix was feeling the same way.",
