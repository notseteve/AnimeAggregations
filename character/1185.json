  "description" : "Vespiquen is a single ruler of a colony of Combee, and is known as \"The Queen of Insects\". Its abdomen acts as a six-celled honeycomb for Combee grubs. They feed on honey collected by other Combee, and protect the Vespiquen if its in danger. The jewel that is located on the head of every Vespiquen is used in battle to collect rays of light that can be reflected and fired at any enemy at will. Vespiquen can also learn three powerful order attacks (Attack Order, Heal Order, and Defense Order) which it uses to call its fellow Combee for help on defending itself, healing itself, or attacking an enemy. Vespiquen is always female, as such only female Combees can evolve into it.",
