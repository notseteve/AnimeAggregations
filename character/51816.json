  "description" : "Shiiko is Akane`s childhood friend. She goes to a different school than Akane, but she starts to show up at Akane`s school since she has not seen her around lately. She is worried about Akane being depressed. She has a lot of nerve, doing things like openly showing up at Kouhei`s school`s homeroom or graduation ceremony. As an excuse, she says this behavior is okay because there are other students wearing different schools` uniforms around, meaning Rumi Nanase. She had the same childhood friend as Akane, but after he went to the Eternal World, her memories of him completely vanished. There are many times when she turns against Kouhei.\nSource: Wikipedia",
