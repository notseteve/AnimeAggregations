  "description" : "Rhodanthe is the instructor at the Auto Memories Doll Training School.\nShe was the instructor when http://anidb.net/ch89959 [Violet] went there to become a full-fledged Doll. She explained the qualities an optimal Doll has to have to graduate from the school, and she would not do so if she did not deem the students worthy. She seemed to be quite astounded by Violet`s skills. But during a practice on the students actual ghostwriting skills on each other, Rhodanthe was unimpressed with the way Violet ghostwrote http://anidb.net/ch93417 [Luculia]`s letter, informing her that letters are an instrument for communicating a person`s feelings, and that letter she ghostwrote was unacceptable. However, upon being shown a letter Violet wrote for http://anidb.net/ch95266 [Luculia`s brother], she allowed Violet to graduate and congratulated her.\nSource: Violet Evergarden Wiki",
