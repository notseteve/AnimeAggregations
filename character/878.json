  "description" : "Blaziken is the third evolution of Torchic, one of the Hoenn starters. The flames burning on its wrists will blaze intensely during its battles, and become stronger as Blaziken exerts itself. Its legs also allow it to leap over skyscrapers thirty stories high. Blaziken can dish out powerful kicks in just one second. After years of using martial arts, its feathers may burn off from the intense heat in its body. Newer, healthier feathers will grow in their place. They can spray flames from their toes with devastating effect.\nIn the anime, May`s Combusken evolves into a Blaziken. May goes on to use her Blaziken in the final Pok√©mon Contest battle against Ash`s Sceptile, ending in a draw.",
