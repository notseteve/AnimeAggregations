She often visits Shouta at the abandoned building to talk. However, she has a huge secret. Her father makes money by forcing her to participate in sexual videos.

When Shouta learns the truth, she stabs him to death as well and plans to escape into hiding. However, she recieves a shigofumi from him expressing his love for her, and she goes back to the abandoned building in order to launch the rocket he left behind. While she is in the progress of launching it, Detective Nojima finds her. A gust of wind blows a tarp onto the rocket, and she runs at it with a knife to cut it free. Another detective misunderstands the situation and shoots her to protect Nojima. She suffers a fatal wound, but she dies as she watches Shouta`s rocket successfully take off and fly into the sky.",
