The group initially consisted mostly of junior high schoolers who seeked for strength and gathered around http://anidb.net/ch12151 [Masaomi]. Although it started as a non-violent group following a conflict with the http://anidb.net/ch14887 [Blue Squares], fueled by http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Izaya] as information dealer to both sides, lead to a change in its principles.\nAlthough Masaomi quit the leadership position, the gang continued to grow after absorbing the leftover members of the Blue Squares, eventually leading into a conflict with the http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars].",
