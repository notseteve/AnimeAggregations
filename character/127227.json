Vic is a reliable older brother to Toria, who is an innocent younger sister. They both love Pokémon!\nHe admitted to be rooting for Leon but was a fan of Pikachu`s 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt attack. He initially held back Toria but they were both invited to pet all of Ash`s Pokémon.\nHe got concerned after Toria got separated from him after she chased after a Gossifleur. After searching with Ash Ketchum and Cynthia, they found her in the park bushes watching a Gossifleur evolve into an Eldegoss. Reunited, they returned to the stadium to watch the remaining part of the match between Leon and Diantha.",
