  "description" : "Ralph Fitzlard Deon de Lac is a young boy who seems to live to serve Vetti. Always at his side he is a constant pester trying to ensure Vetti`s health. When Vetti`s health starts to deteriorate Ralph uses every means necessary to try and help, even confronting the holy oracle for guidance. The relationship between Ralph and Vetti is never fully explained, though it is obvious the young boy is sadly in love with the man. These feelings are unfortunately never revealed though, for Ralph is cruelly murdered by Vetti`s wife in the misguided idea of obtaining peace in the \"Black Cross\", the over ruling religion of the galaxy.",
