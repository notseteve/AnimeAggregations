  "description" : "Akamatsu Arundo is a mercenary of Shibumi, a corrupt politician. Arundo feels jealous that Shibumi told Saitou Hajime to kill Kenshin, but Saitou tells Arundo that Arundo could kill Kenshin and take credit for Kenshin`s death. Arundo ambushes Kenshin and tries to use a chain to immobilize Kenshin. Kenshin ultimately defeats Arundo. Arundo discovers that Saitou is actually allied with Ookubo Toshimichi. When Arundo, fearing for his safety, decides to cut ties with Shibumi and go out of the country, Saitou appears and decapitates Arundo with a strike from his sword; he kills Shibumi shortly afterward.\nWatsuki stated \"this character`s only here to get beat up.\" As Arundo appears to aid story development, Watsuki made Arundo arrogant (Watsuki`s favorite personality trait for villains) and added no other personality traits. Watsuki believes that he was unable to make Arundo`s chain-scythe to appear like real chains. His design originates from a superhuman soldier in an American comic book who has a name similar to Arundo`s, that being X-Men`s Russian supervillain Omega Red (赤 aka relating to \"red\", and 末 matsu corresponding to \"end\", equivalent to \"Omega\", which is the last letter of the Greek alphabet - also related to the Christian concept of Alpha and Omega); Arundo`s use of chains also parallels Omega Red`s carbonadium tentacles.",
