  "description" : "Rikuo is the title character and main protagonist of the series, an average 12-year old boy who inherited 1/4 of his grandfather`s youkai blood. In times of impending danger his youkai blood awakens and he switches into his night form to become the Master of the youkai (the master of all spirits). His youkai form is confident, strong and inspires \"Fear\" amongst his allies leading many to join him. Rikuo is destined to take over as the Third Master of youkai from his grandfather, though the main conflict for the first portion of the series lies in his rejection of the idea. As a child, Rikuo respected and looked up to youkai, playing pranks on members of the Nura house and often declaring he would become more youkai-like and take over as the Third. However, after a discussion at school, he came to realize the evil nature of youkai deeds and decided to set himself firmly on the path of living a strictly human life. Since then, he has attempted to become more like a normal human by doing all sorts of good deeds. Even though he appreciates all that his youkai underlings do for him, he is nevertheless desperate to prevent his school friends from learning of his connection to youkai. After being tested by Gyuuki he decides to take the position of Young Head and saves both humans and youkai.",
