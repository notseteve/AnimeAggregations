  "description" : "A research member in Victor Qondria University`s Brain Research Program (age group matches that of third-year high school, but skipped a grade through America`s educational system). She is famous in America for writing thesis papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She doesn`t like to show weakness to others and so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious and when she builds interest she pokes into things. Occassionally has views that differ from regular opinion, like, \"The experiment data is more important than the subject`s privacy.\" Rintarou often tells her, \"Hey, you`ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist\", but she`s not one to agree to such things personally.\nRintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular \"Christina\" (クリスティーナ) and \"Assistant\" (助手).",
