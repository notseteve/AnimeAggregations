  "description" : "The Washuu Clan is a http://anidb.net/t7110 [ghoul] clan that originated from the Middle East. They have frequently practiced http://anidb.net/t762 [cannibalism] throughout their long history, giving them powerful RC cells even from birth. They were involved in the formation of the http://anidb.net/ch69612 [CCG] and are the central family leading it. Its members have hunted ghouls for well over a century, exterminating them using specialized methods. In 1890, the Japanese government enlisted the family in the founding of the Counter Ghoul Institution, a federal government agency that would manage and pursue ghouls. Since then, its members have acted as prominent officials within the law enforcement agency.\nSource: Tokyo Ghoul Wiki",
