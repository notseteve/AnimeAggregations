  "description" : "After her older brother http://anidb.net/ch17237 [Murata Tetsuya] deliberately misled Sakata Gintoki into tracking down the purportedly missing Benizakura, only for him to get seriously injured, Murata Tetsuko felt guilty and finally admitted that she was aware that her brother has manufactured the bio-mechanical sword Benizakura in cahoots with http://anidb.net/ch10407 [Kiheitai], though she did not alert http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki] to it initially. She came to the injured http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki] asking for help to stop her brother, and gave him a katana with a coiling dragon emblem on the hilt that on first glance, resembled a pile of poop.",
