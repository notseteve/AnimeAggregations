  "description" : "The second piece awakened recently in Red Priest Rezo, a great sorcerer and priest. Rezo was blind, and nothing he or anyone else tried could cure his blindness, even though he was able to cure the blindness of others. Eventually, Ruby Eye began having more and more influence over Rezo`s soul, forcing the sorcerer to seek out the Philosopher`s Stone, which would give Ruby Eye the strength to be fully reborn. He succeeded (Rezo swallowed the stone), but was shortly thereafter defeated by Lina Inverse using Giga Slave and the Sword of Light.",
