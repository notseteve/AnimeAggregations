Bianca agreed but the battle didn`t turn out as interesting as Cilan hoped it would. Bianca`s Shelmet kept hiding in its shell and used Protect to increase its defense. The battle was cut short when one of Professor Juniper`s assistants informed her that they were having problems at the base camp.\nLink Trade Evolution\nBianca`s Shelmet was traded with Professor Juniper`s Karrablast using Professor Juniper link trade device. After solving the problems with the electrical interference the trade was successful and Bianca`s Shelmet evolved into Professor Juniper`s Accelgor while Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved into Bianca`s Escavalier.",
