In \"Buso Renkin After,\" she is revealed as an extremely shy girl, who wore her Buso Renkin mask because of her shyness. Without her mask, she is blond wearing a blue headband. She can guess the oxygen density accurately, which she tells to help Hiwatari. In the anime, she is part of the Victor Search Team sent to find and kill Victor, but they are easily defeated.
