  "description" : "The Slane Theocracy, usually referred to as The Theocracy, is a human nation located to the south of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick]. It was founded over 600 years ago by the Six Great Gods, who were heavily implied to have been players from Yggdrasil, after they led the humans in a rebellion against the dragons who had enslaved them. It is the strongest human nation around and promotes a doctrine of human supremacy and the persecution of other \"lesser\" races. With its goal of allowing humanity to survive in the face of the more powerful demi-human nations, the Theocracy often manipulates the affairs of other human nations for what they see as the greater good.\nSource: Wikipedia",
