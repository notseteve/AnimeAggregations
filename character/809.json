  "description" : "Stocks was an http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Alliance] rear admiral and vice commander of the http://anidb.net/ch96433 [11th Fleet]. He participated in the http://anidb.net/ch6225 [National Salvation Military Council]`s coup d`Ã©tat against the Alliance government, alongside his commander, http://anidb.net/ch800 [Luglanju].\nAfter http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] refused to take part in the coup, the 11th Fleet mobilized to face the loyalist forces, meeting them in a decisive engagement at the Battle of Doria. Catching the 11th off-guard, Yang succeeded in cutting it in half, and http://anidb.net/ch741 [Dusty Attenborough]`s squadron was sent to occupy the forward forces under Stocks. Eventually, the Yang`s forces rejoined Attenborough`s squadron, critically outgunning and outnumbering Stocks` forces. Despite Yang`s repeated offers of surrender, Stocks refused to surrender, and was lost with the rest of the 11th Fleet.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
