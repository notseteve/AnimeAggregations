She is the primary love interest of Dark Schneider. She is the first to use the \"virgin`s kiss\" to awaken Dark Schneider. Having undergone priestess training she does not show any magical talent until later in the manga and never in the OVA. Despite this, she is the one person that DS fears and (mostly) respects.",
