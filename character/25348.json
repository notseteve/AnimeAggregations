  "description" : "The Snipe department`s ace, Butei rank S. No family name. She`s habitually taciturn, impassive and indifferent in fashion. Kinji later finds out that this, along with her hair color, was to due to the influence of large quantities of RiriIrokane in her birthplace. RiriIrokane is Azure Irokane and can nullify other powers in a state of calm. However, according to a Hotogi Historical Record it `hates` human hearts and the princesses of Ulus (of which Reki is part of) revere and offer their `hearts` to it. She`s always seen wearing headphones. Her signature quote is \"I am a single bullet. It has no heart. Therefore, it does not think. It just flies straight towards its target\", which she always say before she shoots her target. She can shoot anything without missing her target within a 2km radius. Her personal weapon is a Dragunov sniper rifle with an attachable bayonet. She apparently listens to the sound of wind from her homeland (somewhere between Northern Mongolia and Siberia) with her headphones, which are Sennheiser PMX990.\nShe plays a minor role in the series, usually providing covering fire to Aria and Kinji when they are fighting at close range or saving them during times of trouble.\nApparently before coming to Butei High, Reki was also doing \"unrecorded\" jobs in Russia and China due to her Butei license. In other words, she worked as a \"Sweeper\", killing her targets.\nSource: Wiki",
