  "description" : "Known to Bernard as Professor Je Labelle, this high-ranking French member of Alchemy remains a mysterious character. Even Prim does not always understand his decisions. He`s the driving force behind the scenes of the revived Kessler Project, and considers himself immune to interference â€” only Woerns outranks him, and the Commander has many problems and few options. An air of conspiracy follows him, in part because he is typically smiling to himself when misfortune strikes. The only event to visibly catch him off-guard was when the Ghoul appeared unexpectedly in episode five (Seraphim), revealing itself to the enemy spy Bernard.",
