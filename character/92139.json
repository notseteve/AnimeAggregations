  "description" : "Okiku is a cursed doll that was brought into Konohanatei by some priest. Compared to regular Japanese dolls, she talks, moves and her hair grows. Before that, she was given to a certain girl by her grandma as a present for being firstborn. Her family found her creepy at times and, due to that, they put her away in the shed for several seasons.\nOnce she arrived at the Konohanatei, girls made her new clothes and http://anidb.net/ch90644 [Ren] fixed her hair and makeup. She became attendant and was often bullied by http://anidb.net/ch90642 [Sakura] for fun.",
