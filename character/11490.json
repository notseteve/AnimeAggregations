  "description" : "Momoko is a strange and hyperactive, barefoot (but she starts to wear shoes to school after Koushi buys her a pair) young girl who is also a martial artist in a special form of martial arts that only members of the twelve Zodiac Masters of Japan can learn. She is associated with the dragon of the Chinese zodiac. She wants to become Koushi`s bride in order to produce a strong son with him, as her father told her that since she is a female, she is currently unable to master her family`s martial arts techniques effectively. Momoko shares a strange relationship with Koushiâ€”its early stages have been compared to that of a dog and it`s master in the series itself. Momoko is very adamant about getting married to Koushi, and often tries to do the best she can to please him in any way. She always refers to Koushi ending his name with the term \"-dono\" because she has huge respect for him. Her martial arts skill is very incredible for a girl at her age which is very useful to protect Koushi from the assassins. She also has much stronger heart and sense of determination than Koushi. Although he does not see or admit to it, Koushi always appears to be pathetic for he always has to depend on Momoko to defend him against his enemies. For Koushi`s sake, Momoko will do anything even sacrifice herself for him because she loves him too much and always believes in Koushi. A running gag throughout the series is if she is experiencing extreme emotions, she will change into a super deformed form.",
