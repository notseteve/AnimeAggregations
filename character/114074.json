  "description" : "Goldschmidt was an Imperial professional duellist who was reputed to have never lost a duel in his career. In January 792 UC, he was hired by Count Herxheimer as his proxy in a duel to settle a mining rights dispute with the Schaffhausen family. However, he was murdered soon after by a mysterious black-mantled man under the guise of a duel. The black-mantled man turned out to be an assassin hired by Marquise Sussanna von Beenemünde to replace him and assassinate Schaffhausen`s representative Reinhard von Müsel.\nGineipedia",
