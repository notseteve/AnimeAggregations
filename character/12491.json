  "description" : "Presea is the top blacksmith in Cephiro, known there as a Pharle or \"artisan.\" She is one of Clef`s students and seems to have a crush on him. She aided the Magic Knights by making their legendary swords of escudo.\nShe shows something of a sadistic side, plotting ways to punish Mokona for making a mess in her study (including yanking his ears, hanging him upside-down while she dances about him dressed as a Native American, and prying his ever-closed eyes wide open).",
