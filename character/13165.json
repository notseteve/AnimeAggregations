  "description" : "Sigyn is the 25 year old Queen of Krisna and Hodr`s wife and a close friend of Rygart. They went to the same military school as him, where she was known as the \"Mad Scientist\" for secluding herself in the school`s lab for 3 days and nights without eating or drinking. She pursues a career of science and cares deeply for her friends, to the point of pointing a gun at Rygart upon first seeing him to ask why he didn`t show up at her wedding and confirm that he doesn`t hate her. While she is the Queen, she rarely acts like one as she usually spends in the castle maintenance workshop tinkering with machines with the royal engineers. Even though she and Hodr are married, both of them are never seen sharing the same bed suggesting their union was an arrange marriage. It is later reveal Sigyn was in love with Rygart during their days in military school but Rygart purposely didn`t hear her confession to him when he returned to take over his father`s farm because he felt Sigyn deserved a better life with someone else. Even after being reunited and married, she still loves Rygart.",
