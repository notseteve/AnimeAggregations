  "description" : "Rickert was the youngest in the old Band of the Hawk; he was just a child.\nHe is one of the few surviving members of the original Band of the Hawk. After the Eclipse, which he wasn`t present at, he lived with Godo, the smith who created Guts` Dragon Slayer, and became his smith apprentice. For the next two years, Rickert`s talents as a smith grew. He tweaked Guts`s armour and replaced his old crossbow with a repeating crossbow. During his stay with Godo, Rickert had remained completely unaware of what transpired at the Eclipse. He was thus able to put the past behind him. It wasn`t until after Guts, Griffith and Casca were reunited at the Hill of Swords that he learned of the original Band of the Hawk`s fate. Even still, Griffith offered Rickert a position in the new Band of the Hawk. After the death of Godo and the destruction of his mine by Zodd, Rickert travels with Godo`s adopted granddaughter, Erica.",
