  "description" : "A student at Lutwidge that, along with Reo, catches Oz`s attention as they can play the tune from his pocket watch. He first meets Oz in the Latowidge library where they get into a fight over a character in the novel series \"Holy Knight\" (Elliot spoils the ending for Oz`s favorite character, Edgar). He also doesn`t like Ada calling his name and despises how the Vessalius seem to get away with anything just because they were heroes 100 years ago. Ada, however, thinks he is a nice and dependable person deep down. He is the legitimate heir of the Nightray Dukedom and consequently the brother of the adopted Vincent and Gilbert. He is adept with the sword and keeps a blade with his family crest in a violin case. Elliot has a strong sense of right and wrong and tends to say things without consideration to the other party. It is through this straightforwardness, however, that Oz finally overcomes the shadows of his past.\nSource: Wikipedia",
