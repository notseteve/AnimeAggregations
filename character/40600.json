She demands not to hand over http://anidb.net/ch40719 [Yoriko] to http://anidb.net/ch40610 [Darklore] unopposed but objects http://anidb.net/ch40602 [Seiryuu]`s plan of using http://anidb.net/ch5895 [Kyouta] as Yoriko would then just be under the control of another mindbreaker. Later she performs a sneak attack at Kyouta; when Rumiko intervenes, Byakko secedes from http://anidb.net/ch40598 [Arayashiki].",
