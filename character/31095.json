  "description" : "An upbeat girl with short light-brown hair, who usually wears a green athletic jacket decorated with buttons. Her weapon is a pair of greaves. She has an obsession with Kung fu, and even uses their techniques in battle, similar to Lisa Silverman of Persona 2. Most of the time, she is friendly, cheerful, and energetic, but she has a short temper. Chie, Yukiko, and Rise are unskilled at cooking, often providing the main cast with unpalatable to terribly awful dishes through the course of the story. Yousuke refers to their horrible cooking as \"Mystery Food X.\"\nHer Persona is Tomoe of The Chariot Arcana, a muscular female figure wearing a yellow outfit reminiscent of Bruce Lee`s famous tracksuit (referencing her love for Kung-fu movies), wielding a double bladed naginata. Tomoe is shown to use both physical and low-level ice spells. Tomoe evolves into Suzuka Gongen after maxing out the Chie`s Social Link, the Chariot.\nChie`s Shadow takes the form of a masked dominatrix with long black hair, supported by three pale female students. It represents her jealousy of Yukiko`s feminine side and her talents, as well as her wish and need to maintain control over Yukiko.",
