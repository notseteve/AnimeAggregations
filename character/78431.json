  "description" : "Tierno`s Blastoise is the evolved form of Tierno`s Wartortle. It evolved sometime after the training session with Ash when it got captured by Team Rocket. Since that time, Tierno and Tierno`s Wartortle had been improving their dancing and battling, which caused it to evolve.\nTo help Serena`s Eevee overcome its shyness and to learn how to battle, Tierno`s Blastoise teamed up with Pikachu in a tag battle against Shauna`s Ivysaur and Serena`s Eevee. The battle was cut short though as Serena got an idea for a new performance and wanted to practice it immediately. Tierno`s Blastoise and Pikachu then had a battle but only the start of it was shown in the episode.",
