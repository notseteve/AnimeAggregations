  "description" : "Roger Smith is the series protagonist. He is the Negotiator. His job entails finding a resolution for the troubles of Paradigm City, the \"City of Amnesia\". He`d negotiate anything for anyone, but he is a professional and expects the parties to behave professionally. Despite this, he displays a certain aversion to the Paradigm Corporation, and takes the jobs he gets from them only if they happen to involve a threat to the city itself or are of personal interest to him. When memories betray the people and force them to reawaken monstrosities of the city`s past, Roger`s only option is to fight back with a monstrosity of his own, the black megadeus Big O.",
