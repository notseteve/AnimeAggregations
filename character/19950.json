  "description" : "1st Vongola Generation Sky Guardian\nThe Founder of the Vongola Famiglia and thus its first boss and the creator of the Zero Point Breakthrough. He first appeared in Chapter 158. After his retirement, he moved to Japan and started a family, of which Tsuna is a descendant. He is the great-great-great-grandfather of Tsuna. Tsuna has repeatedly been shown to be very much like him, as they have the same weapon and techniques (including the Zero Point Breakthrough), similar appearances, and equally unorthodox Families (the first Family included kings, military men, rival mafiosos, and religious people). Their Guardians are quite similar as well: Yamamoto, Hibari, Mukuro, Lambo, Gokudera, and Ryohei have already been shown to be very much like their predecessors in appearance, weapon of choice, and personality.
