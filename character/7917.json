  "description" : "Jun is a friend of Yuichi`s who sits behind him in high school. Before long they even start making odd jokes, such as the fact that they always wear the same clothes to school due to the dress code. Jun has a crush on Kaori Misaka and will often follow her around despite Kaori`s dismissal of his romantic affections. He is seemingly there for little more than character development, as well as being one of the male characters with a name.",
