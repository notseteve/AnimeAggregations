  "description" : "Yuusaku`s grandmother. She usually lives with Yuusaku`s parents out in the country in the Godai family restaurant, but she occasionally comes to visit her favorite grandson in Tokyo (though Yuusaku would rather prefer she didn`t). Akemi, Mrs. Ichinose and Yotsuya love when she visits as she always joins them in their drinking, however \"Grandma\" Godai does not torment Yuusaku in quite the same way. She truly cares for her grandson, recognizes his situation with Kyouko, and her schemes are ultimately constructive for the two of them (and, in contrast to Mrs. Ichinose, she`s far more successful at it).",
