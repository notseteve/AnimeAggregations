Though the Vanguard Frigate is the smallest warship of the Varauta fleet it has a balance of maneuverability, armor and weaponry suitable for many roles. The Vanguard Frigate is extremely reliable and the ship is deployed in numerous small-ship operations including vanguard, enemy detection, armed reconnaissance, defense and other such missions.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/varauta-vanguardfrigate.htm",
