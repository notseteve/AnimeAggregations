  "description" : "Kariya is the uncle of Shinji Matou and Master of Berserker. He is the only member of the Matou family who truly loves Sakura Matou like a daughter, and is upset that Tokiomi allowed his younger child to be adopted by Zouken. Kariya had previously left the Matou family ten years prior to the 4th Holy Grail War out of disgust for his own family, but returns and makes a deal with Zouken Matou that he will win the Grail War in exchange for Sakura`s freedom. Due to his lack of formal training, Kariya was implanted with the same magical worms as Sakura. This caused a number of side effects as the worms would literally eat away at their host, causing Kariya`s health to progressively fail in return for significantly expanding his magic circuits and magical potential. By the time of his summoning of a Servant, Kariya`s hair had turned white and the nerves on the left side of his face were dead. In addition, his natural lifespan had been shortened to such an extent that Zouken estimated he would only live on for one additional year. However, despite the Crest Worms and his own accelerated training, Kariya remained severely lacking as a Magus. At Zouken`s behest, he compensated for this by summoning the most powerful of the seven Servant classes, the Servant of Mad Enhancement, Berserker. However, the high volume of magical energy required to maintain Berserker causes him constant, excruciating pain.\nSource: Wikipedia",
