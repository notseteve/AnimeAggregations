  "description" : "Celestial Being is a private paramilitary force founded by the scientist http://anidb.net/ch2206 [Aeolia Schenberg]. It pursues the complete eradication of armed conflict mainly through the deployment of the revolutionary Gundam units, as well as other mobile units in aggressive, sometimes indiscriminate armed intervention. It acts upon the advisory of the artificial intelligence Veda, and its preferred mode of operation resembles guerilla or maneuver warfare. As of the initiation of its publicly visible activities in 2307, Schenberg appeared in a taped worldwide broadcast announcing the organization`s existence and intentions. Many people of Earth began a love/hate-like relationship with Celestial Being, though everyone does not desire war. Some people, like http://anidb.net/ch2193 [Marina Ismail] of Azadistan, believe that they create only more conflict by intervening.",
