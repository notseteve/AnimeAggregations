  "description" : "Samson Oak received a Vulpix egg from the Kanto region from his cousin, Professor Samuel Oak and he brought it into the Pok√©mon School classroom to show it off. He didn`t analyze the eggs to see what they were as he thought it`s much more fun to wait for it to hatch.\nHe had two eggs and he asked the class which one they wanted to raise and he would raise the other one. The class chose the egg discovered up on Mount Lanakila and he kept the Kanto egg to raise. In SM14, it hatched from an egg into a Vulpix.",
