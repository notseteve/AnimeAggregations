  "description" : "Kazehana is a tall and extremely buxom Sekirei whose first encounter with Minato was to stumble into his bed in a drunken stupor.\nShe takes an immediate interest in Minato, surmising that he could be Hiroto Minaka`s son because Minato possesses the same hand shape and cheek bones, but she keeps this belief to herself.\nDespite experiencing physical reactions to Minato, Kazehana initially keeps her distance, hoping that Minato will display some \"manliness\".\nAfter witnessing Minato`s concern and love for his Sekireis, Kazehana chooses him as her Ashikabi.\nKazehana displays an extremely relaxed personality, preferring to spend most of her time lounging and drinking sake, and often becomes giddy when discussing matters of love.\nHowever, when she becomes serious she displays a lot of power and lets nobody (with the exception of Minaka, Miya, and Minato) talk down to her.\nKazehana knew about Uzume`s secret, and while she didn`t condone Uzume`s actions, she understood Uzume`s motivations (love for her Ashikabi).\nPrior to meeting Minato, she had an unrequited love with Minaka, but was rejected because he loved someone else.\nAlong with Matsu, Kazehana was a member of the first Disciplinary Squad.\nKazehana has the ability to control and manipulate wind, which also grants her a limited ability of flight.\nHer name literally means \"Wind Flower\", with Miya`s nickname for her being \"Public Obscenity\".\nHer known attacks is the Flower Whirlwind (花旋風), Flower Dance (花の舞), Flower Feast (花宴) and Cherry Flower (花桜), and her Norito is \"Wind of my pledge, blow away the dark clouds for my Ashikabi!\"",
