  "description" : "Kirara is Kanna Village`s water priestess. Her title affords her a certain level of reverential treatment from the other villagers, even from her elders, and as such she has a somewhat high degree of freedom in comparison to most female villagers, generally being allowed into discussions where all men but only the elder women would take part. Regardless of her status, however, she is far from being arrogant, and in fact she volunteers to take the burden of seeking the samurai that will defend her village. Kirara has the best outcome for her village first and foremost in her mind, and her faith in the samurai she takes back home with her is unshakable.",
