  "description" : "In Space War I, the U.N. Spacy made extensive use of Glamor`s ES-11D Cat`s Eye reconnaissance spaceplane. The ES-11D was designed for operation both in an atmosphere and in space the Cat`s Eye makes use of two sets of engines for theatre-specific operation. In an atmosphere, the ES-11D makes use of two engines along either side of the dorsal-aft fuselage while in space it uses two wing-mounted reaction engines for propulsion and maneuvering. A very small crew of one pilot in the aft seat and one operations officer in the front seat work in the cockpit of the ES-11D which features numerous displays for operating the large radome atop the craft. Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] operated on board an ES-11D just before her capture and subsequent first contact with the Zentradi.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/catseye.htm",
