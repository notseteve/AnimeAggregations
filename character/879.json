  "description" : "Mudkip, known as the \"Mud Fish\" species of Pokémon, are featured as one of the selectable starter Pokémon in the third generation of the series. They are small blue Pokémon with a large fin on their head that allows them to sense movements within the air and water, acting as a radar. While in the water, they use the orange, spiky gills on their cheeks to breathe while using their large tail fin to propel themselves. They are extremely strong, despite their small bodies; they are able to lift large boulders by planting all four feet and heaving, and easily crush them. When it comes time to sleep, they bury themselves within the soil at the edge of the water. In the anime, Brock obtains a Mudkip at Dewford Island, which later evolves into a Marshtomp.\nThe phrase \"So i herd u liek mudkipz\" has become an Internet meme following its initial appearance on the imageboard 4chan. The meme has resulted in a large number of tribute videos on YouTube.",
