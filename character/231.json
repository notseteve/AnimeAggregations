  "description" : "Poliwhirl is a large, amphibious, froglet-like Pokémon. Its hands make it seem as though it is wearing white boxing gloves. It is capable of living in or out of water; in order to live out of water, it must sweat to keep its body slimy. prefers to live underwater in ponds where there is less danger.\nIn battle, it subtly undulates the spiral-shape on its belly to put the foe to sleep, using a type of hypnosis. It is also capable of easily escaping the grasp of foes due to its greasy skin. Poliwhirl`s spiral goes in the opposite direction of Poliwag`s. Poliwhirl`s mouth is no longer visible after evolution, but it is concluded that it moved to the center of its spiral, since it now sprays water from there.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Misty had a Poliwhirl in the Johto series, which later evolved into Politoed. Red owns one in the Pokémon adventures which eventually it evolves into a Poliwrath.",
