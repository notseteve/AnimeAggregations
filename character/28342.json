  "description" : "A surgeon at Eisler Memorial Hospital. He and another doctor were to be paired with Dr. Tenma to operate on Mayor Roedecker. Following Tenma operating on a young Johan Liebert, Dr. Boyer was the one who told Tenma that the doctors had to scramble to cover for him on operating on Mayor Roedecker at the last minute resulting in Mayor Roedecker`s death. Because of this, Director Heinemann ended up giving Dr. Boyer the position of Head of Neurosurgery. When it came to the Liebert Twins where Tenma catches Anna collapsing near Johan, Dr. Boyer was instructed to photograph the memory jog on her much to the objection of Tenma. Dr. Boyer told Tenma that Director Heinemann put him in charge of the Liebert Twins now and states to Tenma that he can`t argue with Director Heinemann. Tenma argued with Dr. Boyer stating that he can`t turn this into a media circus when Dr. Boyer has Tenma notice the awakened Johan. Dr. Boyer tells Tenma that he had served his purpose in saving Johan and orders Tenma to return to his post.\nBesides Director Heinemann and Dr. Oppenheim, Dr. Boyer was later found dead when the three of them were mysteriously poisoned by candy left by Johan Liebert.",
