  "description" : "Wanyuudou is the first of Ai`s three companions. He generally appears as an old man whose eyes remain mostly shut, wearing a traditional yukata with a long-sleeved haori, and a red scarf around his neck. When needed by Ai, he takes the form of the black straw doll, by wrapping his scarf tight around his neck, that Ai hands to her clients in the series. He also frequently takes the form of Ai`s coach with burning wheels when she goes to the human world to claim a soul.",
