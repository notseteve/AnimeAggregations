  "description" : "Sara (Af-77LC-CHN) is a 23 year old cyberdoll from Cyberdyne`s customer service division, and is apparently Chinese in origin. She is very addicted to ramen and seems to have an endless stomach for it. Her goal early on is to repossess Cyberdoll May because Kazuya did not pay for her. Sara`s name is inspired by Sarah Connor from the Terminator series. The company that she works for is yet another reference to the same movie series. She later develops a bit of a crush on Kazuya. It is worth noting that in the last episode another delivery CyberDoll comes to Kazuya`s apartment that looks exactly like Sara except with pink hair.",
