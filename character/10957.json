  "description" : "The decadent and amoral M`quve is the commander of a huge mining operation in Zeon-occupied Eastern Europe, which extracts vital mineral resources to feed Zeon`s war machine. He reports directly to Kycilia Zabi, taking great pains to conceal the scope of his operation from the other members of the Zabi family. After his base falls to the Federation`s Operation Odessa, M`quve continues serving Kycilia in space, eventually setting a trap for the Gundam at the devastated Texas colony.",
