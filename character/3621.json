  "description" : "Gifted swordsman extremely loyal to Xanxus. Squalo was actually the next candidate for Varia leadership, after defeating its leader Tyr. He had cut off his own left hand to better understand Tyr, who did not have a left hand. As such, Squalo has an artificial hand in its place which can flip into very severe angles, as to make up for his blind spots in sword-fighting. He submitted to Xanxus due to his \"fury\" and ambition, pledging to make Xanxus the next head of the Vongola Family.",
