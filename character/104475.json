  "description" : "The son of the second richest family in Japan and Mendou`s rival. Also called \"Ton\". Although he and Mendou were childhood friends—they still call each other \"Ton-chan\" and \"Shuu-chan\"—they had a falling out concerning a long-standing baseball rivalry, even though neither is any good at baseball—Ton can`t pitch and Mendou cannot swing, and so Ton returns to settle the score. At first, he is also disgusted by women, a notion that he is unaware of when he orders Lum off the baseball diamond only to learn that aluminum bats conduct electricity. Tobimaro takes a warrior`s approach to the game, training in the mountains year-round. Despite his immense wealth, he does not take advantage of it the way his rival does, choosing instead to dress in a ragged samurai robe and carries his bats on his back. He has also shown the odd ability to eat nearly anything (whole) that enters his mouth and fully regurgitate the same, most notably baseballs; however, he apparently can handle other things, such as when his sister fed him an entire bowl of rice he ate the whole thing including the bowl. There is a woman in his life: Ryoko Mendou, who scares him to death because of her love of torture. After he learns of his sister and her quickly developed terror of males, he refuses to accept her mistaken love for him, despite the frequent pain and extreme bodily damage that results.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
