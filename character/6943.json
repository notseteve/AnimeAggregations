  "description" : "The sixth Angel, Gaghiel, is an aquatic being with a massive body and long jaws filled with sharp teeth. It also has a small \"face\" similar to Sachiel`s on its forehead, and its core is located in its mouth. It is extremely strong, and can use parts of its body to easily slice up combat warships. Unlike the preceding Angels, it does not generate a visible AT field (though it does not appear to be damaged by any fire from the naval vessels around it).\nGaghiel attacked the UN Pacific fleet as it was delivering Unit 02 and (secretly) the preserved embryonic Adam to Nerv. Gaghiel was searching for the Adam embryo, but because the presence of the embryo was secret (apparently even from Seele), Nerv officially reported that Gaghiel was drawn by Unit 02. It managed to damage or destroy almost one third of the UN`s combined fleet.\nGaghiel fought with Unit 02, piloted jointly by Asuka Langley Souryu and Shinji Ikari in their first battle together. Asuka brashly challenges Gaghiel in Unit 02 wearing only B-type equipment (unsuited for marine combat). Gaghiel does not knock Unit 02 into the ocean. Instead, a miscalculation by Asuka makes Unit 02 step onto a flight deck elevator which collapses, throwing the Eva and the Angel into the water, where Asuka and Shinji find themselves immobilized. The Angel bites down on them, trapping them in its jaws. Misato hatches a plan, and Unit 02 forces the Angel`s mouth open (though only with Asuka and Shinji working and thinking in unison), allowing a pair of scuttled Iowa-class battleships (the Illinois and Kentucky) to lodge in its mouth (knocking out most of its teeth in the process) and fire (via remote control) at the Angel`s core, then self-destruct inside the Angel, killing it.",
