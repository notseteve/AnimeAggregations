  "description" : "Many, many years ago, so long ago that no one knows just how long ago it was (presumably at the world`s genesis), Ruby Eye and the shinzoku of his world, Flare Dragon Ceifeed, began a massive battle for control of the world. As a mazoku, Ruby Eye`s goal was to completely destroy the world, while Flare Dragon wanted to protect it from destruction. The length of this battle is unknown, but the conclusion was reached approximately around 4000 BK. Ceiphied was successful in weakening his demonic counterpart Ruby-Eye Shabranigdo by cutting the Ruby-Eyed Lord into seven pieces. Ceiphied died in so doing, but left behind four beings to continue his struggle: Aqualord Ragradia, Flarelord Valbazard, Earthlord Rangort and Airlord Valwyn.",
