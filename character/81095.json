  "description" : "Puck is the first of the companions that http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] makes during the latter`s days as the Black Swordsman. He is an elf of the pisky race, descendants of the ancient spirits of wind.\nAs an elf, Puck is, at first glance, similar to a miniature naked human. Upon closer inspection, Puck`s features as an elf become more distinct; his ears are elongated and pointed, he has insect-like wings on his back, and he lacks any kind of visible genitals. Puck sports blue hair that grows out in all directions at the front (similar to a tomato stem) and uniformly points backward in the back. Puck`s eyes are the same color as his hair, and he has a feminine facial structure, with large eyes and a soft jawline. He often holds a burdock, the closest thing to a weapon the elf possesses.\nPuck is a whimsical and lighthearted presence that stands out in the dark and unforgiving world he lives in. Not one to take people`s behavior at face value, Puck prefers to find the inherent good in those he meets rather than dismiss them for what he initially sees. As such, Puck displays a great deal of patience when dealing with less-than-reputable characters, and in some cases (like Guts`) Puck does eventually come to find that they do possess some manner of morality and a reason for their brash actions.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
