  "description" : "Golem is a megaton Pokémon made from living stone, and one of the heaviest of all Pokémon species. Golem inhabits rocky mountains and volcanoes, often disguising itself as an inanimate boulder. It will annually shed its skin like a reptile, with its new shell often being bigger than the one before. Its body is almost impenetrable, able to withstand dynamite blasts; it can even detonate its own body, launching itself great distances in order to travel from mountain to mountain. When earthquakes occur near where Golem live, they will tumble down mountains, rolling at an incredible speed.\nIn the video games, the only way to obtain Golem is to evolve a Graveler by trading it to another player.\nGolem has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in the episode \"The Bridge Bike Gang,\" in which Chopper, the leader of a bicycle gang, uses one to battle Ash`s Charmander.\nGolem`s name comes from the word \"golem,\" which is a humanoid clay or stone statue associated with Jewish mysticism.",
