  "description" : "Sakaki is the head mechanic of the SV2. His training was was in mechanics, and he doesn`t really understand the electronics and computers in the Labors. Even though he`s only the head mechanic he only seems to order a lot of the other staff around, including members of Division 2, and not do any of the `grunt` work. A very respected member of the SV2 (though some would say feared rather than respected).",
