  "description" : "Fuu Chein is a character in the manga and anime series Tenjho Tenge. He was Mitsuomi Takayanagi`s martial arts instructor, worked under Dougen Takayanagi, and was associated with Souhaku Kago.\nFuu Chein is from Taiwan. He was hired by Dougen Takayanagi to train Mitsuomi Takayanagi and to make him into an \"ultimate warrior\". He worked in conjunction with another man from the mainland named Pei. Pei provided the technology Fu was using to train Mitsuomi. According to Pei, Fu also has ties to the Chinese Mafia.\nFu is a very angry and vengeful person, and he dislikes receiving orders. He doesn`t seem to like the Japanese very much either; he only came to Japan for the money. Although he usually does as he is told and only mumbles his discontent when Dogen is not present, he does occasionally act on his own when he wants to make things interesting. Fu is also pretty arrogant, and tends to brag too much.",
