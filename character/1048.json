  "description" : "Baltoy is known as the \"Clay Doll Pokémon.\" The first Baltoy seen by humans was discovered in ancient ruins. It moves around by spinning skillfully on its single foot, and is proficient in using Psychic-type moves. Its native habitat is the desert. Baltoy sleeps while balancing on its foot. When seeing other Baltoy, this Pokémon congregates with them and all members of the group begin crying in unison. The reason for the behavior is unknown, but it could be some form of communication.",
