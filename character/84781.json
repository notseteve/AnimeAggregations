  "description" : "Built by http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Komui] with the intention of it lightening the workload of the Science Division, Komlin 2 was fully capable of performing surgery and repair work to anti-Akuma weaponry. Komui, though, programmed it to share his intelligence level and personality, resulting in it apparently sharing his love of coffee. It drank Komui`s coffee and went insane, first attempting to make http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Lenalee Lee] more masculine.\nWhen Komui told the robot that http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]`s Innocence was damaged, it made Allen its top priority and trapped it in the surgery room built into its hull. Lenalee then regained consciousness and kicked the robot (as well as her brother when he tried to defend it), making it explode.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
