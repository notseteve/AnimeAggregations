  "description" : "Xatu has a colorful and elaborate plumage with two red eyes imprinted on its breast; making the Pokémon look like an Native American totem pole. In Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, male Xatu have three yellow stripes along its lower area, while female Xatu only have two. It possesses the power of precognition, rendering it able to see into the past and the future. It often remains motionless for an entire day staring at the sun while it views the past and present. It will also meditate from morning to sunset without moving. Xatu is said to be overwhelmed by the visual feedback of seeing two different time periods at once, or in terror at seeing the perils the future holds. In the game it is said that in some South American countries, Xatu is highly revered as a mystical Pokémon for its abilities.",
