  "description" : "Komiya Saizou is a typical class bully with a playboy persona who is in the same class as Tsukune and Moka. It was stated in the manga that he was sent to Youkai Academy after causing a lot trouble in the human world, and that he was always chasing girls. He is infatuated with Moka and attempted to rape her, but is quickly knocked out by her super-vampire form and disappears from Youkai Academy for a while. The anime classifies him as an orc, while in the manga he was left unclassified. In the manga only, he reappears when Tsukune is elected class president and joins ANTI-THESIS in the hopes of exacting revenge, but ends up defeated when Tsukune temporarily transforms into a vampire. For hastily rushing ahead and bringing other members of ANTI-THESIS without consent, Saizou is killed for insubordination.",
