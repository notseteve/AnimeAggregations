  "description" : "Trubbish is known as the Trash Bag Pokémon. It is said that a trash bag that is thrown away chemically reacted with waste to become this Pokémon. It likes dirty places such as waste deposits.\nDespite finding Black and White`s Pokémon to be well-designed, IGN`s Audrey Drake found Trubbish and its evolution to be contrary to this. IGN AU`s Cam Shea mocked it, jokingly stating that nothing was cuter than an \"anthropomorphic bag of garbage\"; he jokingly suggested that they make similar Pokémon called \"Mediwastical\" and \"Stinkydiaperino\".",
