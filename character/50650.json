  "description" : "Soran`s Warrgle was first seen flying in the air while Ash and his friends were on their way to Higaki City where the Isshu League was to be held. Together with its trainer Soran, the sky warrior Warrgle controls everything in the sky. During tag battles, Soran`s Warrgle pairs up with Riiku`s Mogurew and they use a combination of moves for their attacks and name them appropriate to what the combination produces.\nSoran`s Warrgle had a tag battle against Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Unfezant. The move combinations proved to be effective in the tag battle against Ash and Cilan until they also decided to use their own combination of moves which ended up overpowering Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew and they lost the tag battle.",
