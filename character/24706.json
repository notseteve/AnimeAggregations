  "description" : "The Magic Council is the ruling body of Fiore. The Council oversees guilds and keeps them in check, and they are responsible for the events, caused by mages. For this reason, they do not hold the Fairy Tail Guild, mainly Natsu Dragneel, in high regard due to their idiocy and property damaging tactics. Due to the events of the Tower of Heaven arc, where two members were revealed to as traitors, several Council members have left. They have since been replaced as of the Oraci√≥n Seis arc. The Council has nine members at a time, along with a chairman that makes the final decisions.",
