  "description" : "Izumi Curtis is a skilled martial artist and alchemist living in the southern Amestrian town of Dublith where - with her husband http://anidb.net/ch10173 [Sig Curtis] - she runs a butcher shop. Though she doesn`t usually take on students, Izumi accepted http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric`s plea to accept them as her apprentices and instructed them in alchemical theory and practice for six months.\nAlthough Izumi takes apparent pride in being a housewife and introduces herself as such to anyone who asks, her attractive and humble exterior belies a fearsome disposition such that Ed and Al become terrified at the mere thought of her.\nShe is prone to swift acts of violence and is often seen doling out physical harm, though most acts of overexertion on her part are followed by a regurgitation of blood linked to an internal injury from a failed Human Transmutation several years before. As a result of this, she is one of the few characters able to perform alchemy without the aid of a Transmutation Circle. Izumi is among the strongest women (and indeed characters) in the series.\nShe also appears to enjoy travel (a trait she may have passed on to Edward), as many of her appearances in the series find her journeying outside her hometown. She even announces herself as a \"travelling housewife\".",
