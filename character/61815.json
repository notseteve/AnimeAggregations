  "description" : "Anetai Toyone is a third year at Miyamori Girl`s High, plays captain position. Toyone`s most distinguishing characteristic is that she is very tall (taller than Jun), usually wears large brim hats, and has very unique eyes. Recruited from a rural area in Iwate, she possesses the \"Rokuyou\" abilities. One is to declare a riichi after another player declares, winning off of the initial riichi, which is known as \"Senbu\". This is where she gains her nickname of Right-behind-you-Toyone. Her second ability is to win when she has one tile remaining in her hand, which is known as \"Tomobiki\". A third ability is called \"Shakkou\" and this ability allows her to call dora tiles by having the surrounding two tiles (for example, in the manga, when Toyone is told to use Shakkou, Toyone calls the four of bamboos, which is a dora tile, with the three and five of bamboos). It is unknown if Toyone has other abilities related to the other \"Rokuyou\".\nSource: Wiki",
