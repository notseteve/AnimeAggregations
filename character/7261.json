  "description" : "A mysterious man who finds enjoyment in mooching, voyeurism, and generally tormenting his next-door neighbor Yuusaku; he is famous for breaking a hole through the adjoining wall in order to be with \"young Godai\" (and to use a smaller hole in the wall of Yuusaku`s room to peep into Akemi`s). He is usually seen dressed in a business suit, a yukata or similarly formal attire and tends to speak in a very formal manner (even while drinking and partying with Akemi and Mrs. Ichinose), but what life he may have outside of Maison Ikkoku is a complete mystery to everyone. Yotsuya claims to have a job (but is not above stealing Yuusaku`s food) and comes and goes at odd and changing hours, keeping a schedule known only to himself. He torments Yuusaku directly and Kyouko indirectly, as it is her job to repair the damage done by him. He lives in Room 4 (Yon). His given name in unknown. He provided more than one given name, including Tamezo and Goro. His true name, like his profession, remains a mystery. Yotsuya, which means \"four valleys\" and is the name of a district in Tokyo associated with a famous ghost story.",
