  "description" : "Known as \"The Heretic\" witch, Arachne becomes the main antagonist in Soul Eater after Medusa takes on the form of a little girl. She is the leader of the massive Organisation \"Arachnophobia\" and is referred to as the mother of all Demon Weapons. She is the eldest of the three Gorgon Sisters and thus is Medusa`s older sister. She created a Demon Weapon by killing off humans and killing a witch. Her animal theme is the spider. Unlike Medusa, Arachne`s magic is more focused on manipulating the enemy from afar, not for direct combat. She can create thread that leaves a person immobilized for an unknown amount of time (it depends on how strong that person is) and has another type of magic allows her to pull a person inside themselves and control them by making them face their worst fears; should someone outside distract the targeted person, however, the spell will be broken.",
