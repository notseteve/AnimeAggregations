  "description" : "Toosaka Tokiomi is a magus specialized in the fire element. He`s a user of jewel magecraft and the head of the Toosaka family. He`s one of the Masters of the 4th Holy Grail War. He`s the father of http://anidb.net/ch35637 [Toosaka Rin] and http://anidb.net/ch35638 [Matou Sakura]. He is not particularly talented, and attempts to compensate that through training; still, his both daughters possess extremely rare talents. He is a prideful and arrogant man who keeps a good appearance and his calm at all times, believing that a magus may never fail to be elegant. He also believes in that which he calls \"the path of a magus\", which is a kind of noblesse oblige: he believes that the magus is a superior entity in comparison to regular humans, and as such has special, more important duties.",
