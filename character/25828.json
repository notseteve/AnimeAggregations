  "description" : "Kouda Mikako is a student at Yazawa Geijutsu Gakuen, a special high school for the arts in Tokyo.\nDriven by her dream of becoming a fashion designer and having all the stores sell her handiwork under the brand name \"Happy Berry\", Mikako is at her most conspicuous when she is inspired or in a stormy mood for one reason or another. The former earns her the admiration of her classmates while the latter incenses her teacher Hamada-sensei who thinks nothing of keeping her after school to revise her clumsy handiwork. Mikako has a ferocious rivalry with Mariko who she fears will wield Tsutomu to his detriment along with unrealistic expectations of Tsutomu that leads to a very vivacious and adversarial divergent concourse that often inflames matters on many occasions.\nHer younger sister is http://anidb.net/ch10014 [Sakurada Miwako], one of the protagonists of http://anidb.net/a3145 [Paradise Kiss].\nThe picture shows her the way she appears in Paradise Kiss, with pink hair. She is also known to feature brown and blond hair, as well as different lengths.",
