  "description" : "The chancellor (later Prime Minister) of the Shitoreiyu empire, Dagmyer`s father, Ulyte`s older brother, and the main antagonist of the series. He is the one who planned the invasion of the Holy Land so he could obtain the Seikishin Gaia and the Shield of Gaia within. It is later learned by the Church that Babalun wants not only Shitoreiyu and the Holy Land, but Havonia, Shurifon, and possibly the entire world of Geminar to himself. He later merged with Gaia to defeat Kenshi, only to meet his end by him and Ulyte, where it was later revealed that he is an entity created from one of the Core Crystals. A fragment of his Core Crystal was soon picked up by Dagmyer following his defeat. His personal war vessel is called the Babel, named and modeled after the Tower of Babel with an array of cannons equipped on its hull.\nSource: Wiki",
