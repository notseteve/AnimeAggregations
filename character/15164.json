His parents were killed by Gaichuu when he was young, leading Zazie to become a Letter Bee so that he could seek revenge against all Gaichuu. Because he is so focused on killing Gaichuu, delivering Letters is of course little interest to him. Zazie is very fond of cats. His Dingo is a big cat resembling a black panther, named Wasiolka.",
