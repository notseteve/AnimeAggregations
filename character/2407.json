  "description" : "Saya Minatsuki is an accomplished sweeper, whose fun loving spirit and easy likeability allows her to form a friendship with Train. Her involvement with him leads to his more human outlook on life and his departure from Chronos.\nShe is killed by Creed, who believes that Train`s personality change is a curse due to her. Before dying, she tells Train to \"forget about her\", which causes him to struggle while deciding to get revenge on Creed or not. Her \"spirit\" lives on, often guiding Train and his friends and giving them strength.\nSaya has no memories of her life before the age of ten, due to heavy abuse from her parents. Her first real memory is waking up in hospital and being carried off to a relative`s house. She constantly feels alone until becoming a sweeper, which best suits her personality and way of thinking. She constantly wears a yukata, though it is strange to others, just because she thinks she looks cute in it. She develops the \"Reflect Shot\" over the course of five years. It allows her to fire bullets that ricochet off hard surfaces and strike opponents at odd angles and different velocities. It requires heavy marksmanship experience and a great deal of projectile calculation.",
