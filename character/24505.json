  "description" : "Rhyanna`s Misdreavus had a Pokemon battle with her younger brother in which it defeated his Murkrow fairly easily. He didn`t like the fact that he was defeated so easily and got mad at his sister.\nWith the help of her Misdreavus, Brock found the Dusk Stone under a large rock but Team Rocket showed up and tried to take the Dusk Stone.\nMisdreavus was captured with Meowth`s net which shocked it when it tried to get away. Brock`s Sudowoodo was unable to defeat the large mecha and it captured Lucile, Misdreavus and the Dusk Stone. It wasn`t until Mitchell arrived that it was rescued.",
