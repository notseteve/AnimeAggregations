  "description" : "Minamito Sui is one of Yagyu 4 Ten`ou.\nHe was very weak and vain, being easily beaten by http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita]. However, http://anidb.net/ch1671 [Nishino] threw Kagura into http://anidb.net/ch1168 [Okita] before Minamito`s plate could be smashed. He later woke up from his beating and asked http://anidb.net/ch1668 [Toujou] to allow him to redeem himself by finding and defeating the other members of http://anidb.net/ch1163 [Shinpachi]`s team. http://anidb.net/ch1668 [Toujou] replied by smashing Minamito`s plate and noting that Minamito was a disgrace to the Yagyu clan.",
