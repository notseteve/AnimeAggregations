  "description" : "The dark guild Eisenwald was a guild that specialized in assassinations. Because the Magic Council prohibits mages from taking assassination requests, the guild was ousted from the Mage Guild League six years ago, and became categorized as a Dark Guild. After a failed plot to assassinate the guild masters, they were all put in jail. It was later revealed at the beginning of the Oracion Seis arc that Eisenwald was actually one of the subordinate guilds to Oracion Seis.",
