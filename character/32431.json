  "description" : "First introduced as a stalker of http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka]. \"His\" first meeting with the http://anidb.net/ch37939 [Neighbor`s Club] resulted in gender confusion, as \"his\" appearance is decidedly feminine despite \"his\" assertions of male hood (which are ultimately shown to be false, when her true biological gender is finally revealed).\nA gullible student with low self-esteem, she admiringly believes Kodaka to be a romantic and masculine criminal who lives life the way he wants to, and eagerly pledges to become his underling on the basis that she can learn to become less effeminate through him; however, she also appears to harbor a crush on Kodaka. She fittingly refers to Kodaka as \"aniki\". She tends to do everything Kodaka says to the extreme; when Kodaka asked her to bring http://anidb.net/ch32434 [Maria] something healthy to eat, Yukimura brought a protein shake and tried to force it down her throat until she finished it all.\nSource: Wiki",
