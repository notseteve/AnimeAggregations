  "description" : "A second year from Suminohana Girl`s School, Igarashi is Mitsuru`s kouhai from his junior high school days.\nIgarashi cultivates a \"tough\" exterior, referring to herself as \"ore.\" (\"Ore,\" meaning \"I/me,\" is a pronoun properly used only by men and usually only in the company of other men! Shinobu uses the less rough pronoun \"boku\" in mixed company and Shun uses \"boku\" all the time).\nIgarashi`s quirk gets her into trouble and only the gang of four can help her.",
