  "description" : "Yuuta is a Pokethlon competitor and uses science and computers to improve and check his Pokemon`s performance. Yuuta and his Kabigon encountered Satoshi and his friends in the forest where they were training. He invited them back to his lab to show them his training setup. After telling them about an upcoming Pokethlon event he was going to enter, Satoshi decided he would enter as well.\nCatch Saucer (キャッチソーサー) was the first event that Yuuta entered and he competed with his Sawamular. He left his Kabigon unknowingly in the hands of the Rocket Gang who were posing as masseuses. When he returned to get his Kabigon for the Dash Hurdle (ダッシュハードル) event, Rocket Gang tried to get away but Kabigon was connected to the balloon with a rope and its weight prevented them from escaping. Musashi sent out her Yanamega to cut the rope, but Kabigon used a trampoline from the Bound Field (バウンドフィールド) event to send Rocket Gang flying and free Pikachu.\nIn the final event, Yuuta`s Kabigon went up against Satoshi`s Pikachu. It ended up being a photo finish as Kabigon barely won. Yuuta ended up winning the Tsubaki Town Pokéthlon.",
