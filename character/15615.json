  "description" : "The Shinkirou (lit. Mirage) is a unique eighth-generation Knightmare Frame built by Rakshata Chawla for Lelouch`s personal use. It possesses an Absolute Defense Field, which is an array of hexagonal energy fields driven by a Druid System that can be used to erect a powerful barrier with the proper calculations. The Field is strong enough to resist sustained fire from the Mordred`s Stark Hadron Cannon. Weapons include the Structural Phase Transition Cannon, where the Shinkirou releases a prism-like object into which a powerful beam is fired, which refracts it into dozens of deadly pinpoint lasers. It also has a pair of hadron blasters which fire powerful spherical globes of energy which are sufficient to destroy an unprotected Knightmare Frame in a single shot. It is also able to transform into a submarine, which Lelouch uses to secretly leave and return to Ashford Academy using the hidden underwater passageways beneath the school.",
