She along with Tierno and Trevor are childhood friends who got their starter Pokémon from Professor Sycamore on the same day and then started their journey towards their respective dreams. They occasionally come together at events like the Pokémon Summer Camp to get each other up to speed on their journey.\nHer dream is to become the world`s number one Pokémon Performer. Every time she enters a Pokémon Center, she checks out the newest PokéVisions. Whenever she gets a new Pokémon or obtains a cute ribbon or something, she gets the urge to make a new PokéVision video.\nShauna watched Serena`s PokéVision video and she recognized her at the Pokémon Summer Camp. She kept telling Trevor there was this really cute girl in the video and showed him Serena`s PokéVision numerous times. Shauna took a liking to Serena`s Fennekin and seeing it in the flesh was a great experience for her.",
