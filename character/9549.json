  "description" : "The Lunar Priestess; in sharp contrast with Himeko, Chikane is a very commanding girl of the same age. She has a very noble and elegant aura, lives in a large mansion with many maids, and is considered to be of the highest standing at their school; she has a considerable fan following of both genders and is the frequent target of love confessions. She is a member of the prestigious kyudou (Japanese archery) club and frequently uses the bow as her weapon of preference during confrontations with the Orochi, thus to defeat the other Orochi she uses the Orochi mark as a target. Later events show that she is also skilled in the use of the tantou. Her combat skills are somewhat reminiscent of those taught to the brides of samurai; possibly another indication of Chikane`s family`s high standing. Chikane is also exceptionally skilled in the areas of tennis and, more significantly, the piano; she apparently enjoys playing for Himeko, who enjoys listening to her perform. Many at school believe she has a relationship with Souma, though this is proven to be untrue. She has been in love with Himeko since they first met, although she does not reveal it until much later.\nChikane carries the lunar symbol on her back.",
