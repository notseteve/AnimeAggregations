  "description" : "Rimuru is a slime who was once a human on Earth that reincarnated as a powerful slime due to certain requests he made as he died.\nWhile he technically does not have a gender, he identifies as a male due to his past gender, but http://anidb.net/ch96309 [the feminine body] he obtains from http://anidb.net/ch96300 [Shizu] complicates this slightly. He has the skill, Devour, which allows him to eat almost anything and obtain skills and items from the devoured object. He can even mimic the appearance of any item he has devoured.\nSource: Wikipedia",
