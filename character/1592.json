  "description" : "Togusa is 27 years old, married and has a young daughter, although it depends on the incarnation; in the S.A.C. universe, he also has a son. Togusa`s personality varies somewhat between the manga, movies, and series. In the manga he tends to be very emotional and plagued with feelings of failure; in the films he is savvier but still aware of his inexperience, and in the Stand Alone Complex his personality is a combination of the two. He also tends to be the most emotional and temperamental, getting so outraged at one criminal committing murder right under his nose in an episode of http://anidb.net/a1176 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG] he seriously wounded the man and ends up on trial. He seems very friendly with http://anidb.net/ch1584 [Batou] and he was arguably the one who cracked the Laughing Man case.",
