  "description" : "A very gentle, very frail, anaemic, clumsy, and softly-spoken 20 year old girl. Despite her poor physical health, she is very resilient and is able to quickly recover from any injury, much like Keitarou. She has a very sweet and generous personality, often sacrificing her own happiness for others. She lives on or near the island of Okinawa and has an affinity for watermelons and turtles. She met Keitarou and Naru while taking some time off for a brief vacation after flunking her entrance exam to Toudai for the third time in a row, just like Keitarou.",
