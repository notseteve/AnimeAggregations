  "description" : "Aizawa Kakeru is the younger brother of Aizawa Suguru, who is a soccer prodigy representing Japan in the Under-15 national team. Prior to the series, Kakeru quits his position as a forward after a traumatic experience prevented him from using his left leg and settles for the manager position. After the horrible car accident that left Suguru dead and Kakeru fatally injuried, Kakeru received a heart transplant of Suguru`s heart. With it, Kakeru returns to the soccer field in hope of realizing his and his brother`s unfulfilled dream of winning the world cup.\nPersonality\nKakeru is generally a very positive and kind person. According to Suguru, Kakeru`s fatal flaw is his lack of confidence which is the main cause that prevented him from using his left leg and scoring goals. Even after he fully embraces soccer and awakened as a striker, he still maintained part of his old unconfident self, which can be seen when other top players marked him as a formidable opponent. However, when it`s time to play on the field, Kakeru is very determined and courageous.\nKakeru can also be very sensitive, which is shown when Kakeru still let the traumatic incident prevent him from playing his full potential after all these years. The incident left such a deep impact that Kakeru even considered quitting soccer because of it. He only manages to get over this fear when Hibino directly told him to stop worrying and play his full potential or else they will never be friends again.\nSource: areanokishi.wikia",
