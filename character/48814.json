  "description" : "A deadly addition to the Zentradi Regult mecha forces, the Tactical Scout is the reconnaissance variant of the standard Regult battle pod. Removing all weaponry, the Tactical Scout is equipped with many additional sensor clusters and long-range detection equipment. Always found operating among other Regult mecha, the Scout is capable of early warning enemy detection as well as ECM/ECCM roles (Electronic Countermeasures/Electronic Counter-Countermeasures). In Space War One, the Tactical Scout was utilized to devastating effect, often providing radar jamming, communication relay and superior tactical positioning for the many Zentradi mecha forces.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/reguld-scout.htm",
