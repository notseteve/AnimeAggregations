  "description" : "Tomo is a Pokémon Trainer that qualified for the Kalos League and was matched up against Ash in the first round. He almost won the match by default as Ash almost didn`t arrive on time before the referee called the match.\nMost of the battle was not showcased but Ash defeated Tomo to eliminate him from the competition. As the first round was a 3-on-3 battle, he has at least 2 other Pokémon that were in the match but were not shown at all.",
