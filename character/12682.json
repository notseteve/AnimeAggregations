  "description" : "The WD-M01 Turn A Gundam is a mecha from the Correct Century (正暦 Seireki) calendar system in the anime Turn A Gundam. It is mainly piloted by the hero of the series, and acted as the symbol of the earth militia forces against the superior moonrace.\n∀ Gundam is designed by Syd Mead, for the series Turn A Gundam. The original design of the mecha was rejected by Yoshiyuki Tomino due to its exotic appearance and Tomino decided that he wanted a figure that is closer to the previous Gundam designs. The old design was renamed and used for the Mobile Suit Sumo instead. The design is still exotic to Gundam anime fans, however, Syd Mead designed ∀ Gundam using real world industrial design aspects, which was aimed to make it look simple and realistic. The shield was designed by Syd Mead with little constraint form the production team, it needs to be big enough so that the suit can hide behind it, making it easier for the anime production staff to draw. Syd Mead imagined it to be like a clam shell and finally settled with a design that looked like MS-14 Gelgoog`s shield.\nThe System-∀99 (WD-M01) ∀ Gundam (also known as \"Turn A\") first appeared in the show when the Moonrace`s Diana Counter army arrived on Earth and attacked the city of Nocis; which at the time was holding a Coming of Age ceremony for Loran Cehack and Sochie Heim, who danced and offered prayers in front of the \"White Doll\" statue. When the Moonrace forces attack, the \"White Doll\" statue crumbled, revealing the Turn A. Loran and Sochie take shelter inside the cockpit, which activates and automatically fires at the unaware Moonrace forces. After several battles with the Moonrace, the Turn A became the symbol of the struggle to resist the Moonrace`s attempts at colonizing Earth.",
