  "description" : "Mikura Kazuma is a long-time friend of Ikki who`s always by his side. He is a speed-type rider who has recently inherited the title of Flame King following the path of the Flame Road, along with Spitfires old AT`s. Due to his speed he got the nickname Stealth. His special techniques allows him to `manipulate time` (this technique is actually just an illusion, where he moves too fast for the normal human eye, thus making him able to fool the opponent with his speed, one of these tricks being the `cloning` which is just all his afterimages) and literally marking out a `Flame Road`, where he rides his AT`s at such high speeds that the heat caused by the friction of the wheels creates the illusion of flames. These two techniques are, at some level, inherited from Yasuyoshi Sano, the Aeon Clock, and Spitfire, the former Flame King, respectively. This is highly likely, as they both followed the Flame Road.",
