  "description" : "Chapeau-jii is a spirit sent by the Judge of the Afterlife to watch over http://anidb.net/ch29099 [Enma]-kun and his Spirit Patrol.\nHe is an old spirit in the form of a hat that possesses great knowledge in all matters that relate to the underworld and spirits, so much so that he is known as the \"Underworld`s Living Encyclopaedia\". However he isn`t having the easiest time watching over Enma-kun... it seems that Enma-kun is a lot more interested in http://anidb.net/ch29110 [Yukiko-hime] than searching for spirits... and getting him to listen to some words of wisdom certainly isn`t a simple task for Chapeau-jii.\nSource: Official Site",
