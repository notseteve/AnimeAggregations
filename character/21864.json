  "description" : "Graduating from the same naval academy as http://anidb.net/ch21857 [Oogami Ichirou], Kayama was intended as the original replacement for http://anidb.net/ch21853 [Maria Tachibana] as the leader of the Hanagumi. However, after it was found that his above average spiritual power was still not enough to power a Koubu, http://anidb.net/ch21858 [Lt. General Yoneda] found a different use for him.\nGiven command of the Tsukigumi, or \"Moon Division\" (the reconnaissance and intelligence unit for the Hanagumi), Kayama`s role is to carry out any and all covert missions for the general.\nAs part of his duties he is often seen in disguise, whilst discreetly passing on information to Yoneda.",
