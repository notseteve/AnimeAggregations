  "description" : "Tesla is a Pok√©mon Trainer that traveled in the Kalos region with his older brother Nikola. He had been training with his brother in preparation for his first battle at the Battle Chateau. They are a hip hop duo and speak with a hip-hop dialect which seems to annoy Serena who thought they were rappers.\nIn his debut Battle Chateau match, he faced Ash Ketchum. Unfortuantely for him, Pikachu had a super effective type advantage over Tesla`s Fletchling and also had a lot more battle experience so it wasn`t long until Pikachu was able to defeat it. Ash Ketchum was awarded the title of Baron for winning the match. Tesla was polite and little frustrated but he congratulated Ash Ketchum and looked forward to his next match by vowing to train harder with his brother.",
