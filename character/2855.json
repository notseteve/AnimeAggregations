  "description" : "Quatre is a young aristocrat, the thirtieth child - and only son - of a wealthy family of space colony developers. Though he`s the most tender-hearted and gentle of the Gundam pilots, Quatre is just as brave and determined, and has defied his family`s wishes in order to join the battle against Oz. Quatre is aided by a troop of forty loyal underlings and can draw on the Winner family`s vast resources, assets which more than make up for his relative lack of fighting skill.",
