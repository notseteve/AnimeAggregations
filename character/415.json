  "description" : "Gelus appears in a flashback when Rem explains how to kill a Shinigami. He is a small, doll-like Shinigami whose appearance suggests that he was poorly sewn together from mismatched fabric. He only has one eye, despite having two eye sockets.\nIn the flashback, Rem recalls Gelus watching over a younger Amane Misa in the human world. Knowing that it was Misa`s final day, she watches with him. Having fallen in love with Misa, Gelus uses his Death Note to kill Misa`s destined murderer, against Rem`s protests. Gelus is reduced to a pile of dust as punishment for extending a human life, leaving behind only his Death Note. Rem delivers his Death Note to Misa because it was her that he saved. In the film, he simply drops it and it lands near Misa.",
