  "description" : "Scrib Lowengren is seen in minor roles in Shadow Skill parts 1 and 2. He is the personal apprentice to the Kuruda King, Iba Stol. Upon hearing of Gau`s emerging talent, Low challenged him at least twice. One challenge ended in a draw, the other ended in Gau forgetting all his fear and releasing the full power of Shadow Skill on the older boy. Now they are good friends, and two sides of an uneven love triangle involving Kyou. (Low likes Kyou, Kyou likes Gau. At least in the TV series. The manga has a different take on things.) He wears big, red, cherry-like earrings which play a role in Gau`s most crucial fight at the end of the series.",
