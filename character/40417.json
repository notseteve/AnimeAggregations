  "description" : "Leon`s Beheeyem was instructed by its owner Leon to become friends with so that Leon could capture Ash and his friends Pokémon. It lead them to a illusionary building for them to rest for the night and while they were sleeping, it stole all their Pokémon and Poké balls.\nLeon`s Beheeyem kept creating layers of illusionary dream worlds which required someone to be asleep for the illusion to stay. Ash and his friends Pokémon kept hitting an exit sign once they had awoken to leave the dream world. While in the illusionary dream worlds, Leon`s Beheeyem was a lot more powerful and could do a lot more things than it normally could in the real world like create a large space ship or protect itself from numerous attacks without getting injured.\nOnce Ash and his friends managed to break themselves free of Leon`s Beheeyem`s illusions, Pikachu was able to defeat it quite easily and it was arrested with its owner Leon by Officer Jenny (Isshu).",
