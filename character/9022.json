  "description" : "Yayoi is the original pilot of the white Core Robot, which Kazuki named \"Hartzenen\". After suffering a serious head injury in battle, Yayoi experienced a feedback loop, effectively cutting off her connection to robots and ending her career as a pilot. Kazuki climbed into Hartzenen and took control, saving Yayoi`s life. She refers to Kazuki as \"her prince,\" and falls in love with him.\nYayoi goes to great lengths to spend time with Kazuki, signing up to be his combat instructor and school teacher, and even moving in next door to the Sanada home and building a door into Kazuki`s room.\nWhen Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Yayoi is Kazuki`s homeroom teacher.",
