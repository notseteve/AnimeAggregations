  "description" : "Niwa Hanamichi is a tall and intimidating upperclassman from http://anidb.net/ch87717 [Kurusu Kurogo]`s school. He is silent and usually covered in bruises causing many to believe he is a delinquent. He practised dance for a long time and had a promising future but decided to quit it, in favour of more aggressive hobbies like bodybuilding and martial arts. It turns out however that Niwa is a rather effeminate individual with a liking towards feminine things (such as female dancing or even cooking), but his continuous growth and masculine traits made it exceedingly awkward to do so. Furthermore he went out with a friend he was interested on, who unfortunately had a boyfriend of her own and mostly saw Niwa as more of a female friend than a love interest, which caused him to force himself into a more masculine persona. However he is able to accept himself through Kurusu`s encouragement. He is one of the performers in the kabuki club and also helps teach the other members to dance.\nSource: English Wikipedia",
