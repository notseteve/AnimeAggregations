  "description" : "Exsedol Folmo is an alien Zentradi records keeping officer (a walking living encyclopedia) attached to fleet commander http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], and would always be seen at the side of his superior during Space War I giving advice. He is a Zem First Class \"Archivist\" Official in the http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] Fleet and his memory capacity is said to surpass any electronic device that ever existed, as he keeps details of every combat in the entire 500,000 year old Zentradi history for instant recall. During their first contact with the humans and upon their discovery that they were miclones, Exsedol advised that they should be left alone, quoting an ancient Zentradi battle directive. However, this particular piece of advice was ignored by his superiors.Much later, when the http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] fleet had decided to defect to the humans side, he was micloned and sent to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] as a peace envoy. When the war ended and UN Spacy was re-established he joined up as an advisor. Some time later, he reverted to his larger size and his body went through major alterations as a precaution against him losing the trove of information lying in his mind, which explains his altered appearance in the later Macross productions.Source: wiki",
