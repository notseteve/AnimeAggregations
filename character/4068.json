  "description" : "The main protagonist, the series follows his rapid development from living an average life to becoming an outstanding guitarist. Since he is extremely polite, he cannot help but let others push him around, a possible metaphoric stereotype on the very proper and manner-conscious Japanese society. Recruited as the last member of BECK, he serves as the second and overdriven guitarist and vocalist, and has a very beautiful voice that is mostly used for Beck`s slower songs.",
