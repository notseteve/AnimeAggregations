  "description" : "Rebecca is the Pokémon Co-ordinator that Zoey faced in the final round of the Mecabbage Town Pokémon Contest. She owns a Shuckle that battled against Zoey`s Glameow in the final battle of the contest. Even though, at first, she was giving Zoey a hard time by skillfully using her Shuckle`s Withdraw attack, she ended up losing to Zoey after Glameow penetrated Shuckle`s defenses with a powerful Shadow Claw, and then knocked it out using Iron Tail.",
