He then got the idea to make a Maracacchi Musical so that it might incite many people to gather in his hometown once again. Tobio realized that the future of his hometown depended on what he called: \"Trio the Maracacchi\" (トリオ・ザ・マラカッチ).\nTobio practiced the climax of their performance which Cacchin played an integral part in so they could do well in a Pokémon Performance Contest that would held in the town. His Pokémon Ma-kun and Ra-kun high five while Cacchin was supposed to jump up into the air and stand on top of them and fire Sunny Day, making Petal Dance and Pin Missile shine and creating a rainbow. The whole musical routine was called \"Over the Rainbow\". Cacchin was having problems with the final part of the routine, so Iris`s Emolga was sent out to show it how to jump properly.\nTobio got mad at Cacchin as it wasn`t able to perfect its jump move because it was a bit scared of heights. Cacchin then ran away into the forest where it got into trouble with a wild Penror. After Tobio tried to protect Cacchin from the Penror, Cacchin came to his rescue and then ended up overcoming its fear of heights and was able to perfect the climax of the performance and land on Ma and Ra. Cacchin was able to gain confidence from that experience and was able to land the jump perfectly during the Pokémon Performance Contest.",
