  "description" : "Haku/Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi, a young boy who helps Chihiro after her parents have transformed into pigs. Haku works as Yubaba`s direct subordinate, often running errands and performing missions for her. He has the ability to fly and his true form is a dragon. Toward the end of the story Chihiro recalls falling into the Kohaku (コハク) river, of which Haku is the spirit; she thus frees him from Yubaba`s service by helping him remember his real name and past, which he had forgotten due to the name change and the curse which Yubaba has placed on him. Haku had entered the spirit world seeking to learn magic from Yubaba, and as a result became an apprentice who followed her every command. When Yubaba is nearby, Haku is as sharp-voiced to Chihiro as to anyone else.",
