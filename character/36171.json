  "description" : "Self proclaimed fianc√©e of Ooyama Takeru. She feels strongly for Takeru, and although he doesn`t remember her much she has decided to wait until he fully does.\nHer maken, \"Kamudo\", takes the shape of a gauntlet that when brandished, greatly increases her strength and speed as demonstrated in chapter 7 when she used it to protect Takeru and the cat (later named Monji) he had saved by breaking a huge rock falling on them and then rushing in front of them to deflect the broken fragments. However, overusing it puts enough stress on her to knock her unconscious.",
