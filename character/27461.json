  "description" : "Virizion is known as the Grassland Pokémon. It resembles an antelope. It is closely related to Cobalion and Terrakion. It can be found in a sealed off area of the Pinwheel Forest after winning the trust of Cobalion.\nLegends say that it, along with Terrakion and Cobalion, fought for the rights of Pokémon against the humans that were abusing them.\nVirizion is one of the members of the Sacred Swordsman and was one of the Pokémon that helped Keldeo learn the true weight of its sword to become part of the Sacred Swordsman. Virizion is awesome and is always keeping her cool. Amongst the Sacred Swordsman, she`s the smartest and the fastest Pokémon.\nThe English dub has an odd pronunciation of the legendary Pokémon Virizion (ビリジオン) and it makes it sound exactly the same as Verizon, a large telco in the United States. It`s unclear why they would want to make such a horrible pronunciation of the name to confuse it with a large companies name which is trademarked. The Japanese version of the movie does not pronounce it the same way and the English dub should have stayed consistent with its pronunciation.",
