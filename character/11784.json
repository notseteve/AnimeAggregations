  "description" : "The previous Endless Witch and teacher of Beatrice. Her name comes from the Divine Comedy character Virgil, who guides Dante through Hell and Purgatory to Beatrice, who is his guide through Heaven. She is a silver-haired witch with great powers, despite surrendering most of them to Beatrice with the title of the \"Endless Witch\". She assists Battler during Banquet of the golden witch, helping him to come up with theories to counter the claims that Beatrice sets forth. At the same time, she also assists Beatrice, making her motives unclear. She is a dangerous opponent, as she can beat Beatrice in combat if not for a surprise attack. She is also somewhat bumbling as well.",
