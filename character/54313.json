  "description" : "Hiroto`s Dewott is a member of the Pokémon Gulf Coast Relief Corps which operates out of Pokéwood. It is one of the three main Pokémon that actively help do rescues.\nDuring a training exercise, Hiroto`s Watchog used its precognitive abilities to realize that part of the building was about to fall on its other team members. It quickly pushed them all to safety before the piece hit the ground. Hiroto`s Dewott and the other were all grateful to be saved but Hiroto`s Watchog wanted to help participate in the rescues instead of just supervising. Hiroto`s Dewott got a bit angry even though it was rescued. It knew that Hiroto`s Watchog saved it and the other members, but Hiroto`s Dewott said what Hiroto`s Watchog did was wrong. Hiroto`s Dewott explained with Hiroto help that Hiroto`s Watchog job is to supervise so civilians don`t enter the danger zone.\nHiroto decided to put Hiroto`s Watchog through some training exercises with Hiroto`s Dewott going first each time to see if Hiroto`s Watchog could cope. Hiroto`s Dewott did quite well until in all the tasks.",
