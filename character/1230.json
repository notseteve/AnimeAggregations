  "description" : "Garchomp is the fourth-generation non-legendary Pokémon with high total stats (especially HP, Speed, and Attack); comparable to Metagross, Salamence, Tyranitar and Dragonite. It evolves from Gabite at Level 48. The Champion Cynthia of the Sinnoh Pokémon League has a Garchomp. Garchomp has earned some notoriety as only the second non-legendary Pokémon (after Wobbuffet) to be banned from standard gameplay.\nIts appearance is based off a fictional creature known as a land shark or sand shark. In the anime, Cynthia uses Garchomp in her battle against Paul, where it managed to defeat his team with relative ease. They usually prey off of Zigzagoon, Bidoof, Barboach and Whiscash but their prime favorites are Corphish, Crawdaunt, Krabby and Kingler.",
