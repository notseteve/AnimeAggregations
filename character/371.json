  "description" : "Marowak`s name is a portmanteau of marrow and whack (to strike), with \"marrow\" to represent Marowak`s skull-like head, and \"whack\" to represent Marowak`s nature of striking its opponent with bones. Its Japanese name most likely refers to がらがら garagara, the onomatopoeia for \"clattering,\" as in of bones. Marowak always carries a thick bone in its hand, which it bludgeons foes with. This Pokémon evolves from Cubone and, unlike Cubone, hides its feelings of despair for its loss mother with anger. In Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Marowak`s ghost haunts the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town. Team Rocket is indicated by Cubone`s caretaker to have been the cause of the death. Unlike the skull helmet on a Cubone, a Marowak`s skull helmet is tightly fitted over its face.",
