  "description" : "Renton Thurston is the main protagonist of the Eureka Seven series. He is referred to in episode previews simply as \"the boy\". Renton thinks his life is mundane and dreams of doing the extraordinary. At the beginning of the series, he becomes a member of http://anidb.net/ch2961 [Gekkostate] in order to be near his idol, http://anidb.net/ch2900 [Holland], and his love at first sight, http://anidb.net/ch2875 [Eureka]. In seasons one and two, the other crew members generally see Renton as Gekkostate`s \"busboy\", doing chores such as cooking and cleaning. He occasionally rides with Eureka in the http://anidb.net/ch2958 [Nirvash typeZERO] and is able to lift. In the third season, Renton is shown to mature a bit. Eureka and Renton continue to pilot the typeZERO, and his relationship with Eureka deepens, though the kids (http://anidb.net/ch2895 [Maurice], http://anidb.net/ch2896 [Maeter], and http://anidb.net/ch2897 [Linck]) still refuse to regard Renton as their \"papa\". In season four Renton matures even further, coming into his own as a father to the kids and a prominent member of Gekkostate.",
