  "description" : "Megurine Luka is the third Japanese Vocaloid 2 from Crypton released on January 30, 2009. Her surname combines Meguri (巡, circulate or around) and Ne (音, sound), while the name Luka invokes the homonymous Japanese words of nagare (流, flow) and ka (歌, song) or ka (香, scent); thus making songs to all around the world as scent spreads. Her voice is sampled from Japanese voice actress http://anidb.net/cr82 [Asakawa Yuu].",
