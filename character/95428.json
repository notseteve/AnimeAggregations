  "description" : "The Great Tomb of Nazarick is the guild headquarters of http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz Ooal Gown], widely renowned for being an unconquerable dungeon throughout DMMO-RPG named Yggdrasil.\nPrior to Ainz Ooal Gown conquering this dungeon, the Great Tomb of Nazarick was originally set to have only six floors. After he conquered it, the dungeon was completely reconstructed and was stretched to over ten floors. For travel between floors, there are specific points on each floor, where gates open to allow magical transit. Each floor has its own guardians as well as numerous monsters under their command.\nAt the start of the series, the Great Tomb of Nazarick was transported to another world along with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who also came to life as a result of this. After finding himself in an unknown world, Ainz began to strengthen the tomb and collect information to protect it from any threats.\nSource: Overlord Wiki",
