  "description" : "The 14th Noah was the extra member of the http://anidb.net/ch10022 [Noah Family]. He was the only member, other than http://anidb.net/ch82914 [Road] and the http://anidb.net/ch9471 [Earl], who was able to control the Ark. Before the story`s timeline, he gave this power away to a human and ran, betraying the Earl and the Clan of Noah.\nHe attempted to kill the Earl in order to become the new Earl himself, but was killed in return by the Earl, an ending which greatly depressed the Earl. Later, it was revealed that the 14th had chosen http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen Walker] as his next host. Some time before his death, he told http://anidb.net/ch9409 [Cross Marian] that if http://anidb.net/ch83365 [Mana] was looked after, he would return to him one day.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
