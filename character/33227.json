Feeling restless and tormented by his death as he lay in his grave, Khrist√≥s put aside his Saint title and joined Eris, who revived him with a new body. When he gets an advantage over Cygnus Hyouga, Khristos is betrayed by Eris, who sees this as a good opportunity. She throws a spear into Khristos`s back, which pierces right through his heart, killing him and injuring Hyouga at the same time.",
