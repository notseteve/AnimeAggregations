  "description" : "Luce is the original holder of the Orange (Sky) Pacifier. Her name is pronounced as \"lu-chay\", and it means \"light\" in Italian. She is the mother of Aria and the grandmother of Yuni. She is also the former leader of the Giglio Nero Famiglia.As of the time the Arcobaleno trials were conducted, her status and whereabouts are unknown. In the anime, she seems to have had a good relationship with Reborn and thinks Reborn`s sideburns are his most attractive features. In Reborn`s recollections, it seems that she has some power to see the future, enabling her to know beforehand the curse that comes together with taking care of the Pacifier.\nSource: reborn.wikia",
