  "description" : "Eboshi was the strong-willed and independent leader of Irontown. Though seemingly callous and distant to others, she actually cared a lot about the welfare of her people; the guns they produce are primarily intended to secure their independence from hostile parties. She also takes in lepers, treating them as humans instead of parasites, and helps them with their wounds - a fact which Ashitaka acknowledges to the point that he cannot condemn her for inflicting him (indirectly) with the curse.\nEboshi had many enemies, including San, other humans, and the animal gods. Eboshi and her ishibiya troops were responsible for the cursed iron bullet in Nago, which eventually affected Ashitaka. She shot the Shishigami`s head off, causing it to turn into a God of death and sending forth a dark liquid that killed anything it touched. The liquid fell on Moro`s body, separating her head from her body. After Eboshi threw the Shishigami`s head to Jigo, Moro`s head resurrected long enough to bite off Eboshi`s right arm. This event redeemed her, and she decided to rebuild Irontown not as an industrial center, but as a modest settlement.",
