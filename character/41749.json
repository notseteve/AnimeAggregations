  "description" : "The F/A-27C is the primary fighter-attack aircraft fielded by the Imperial Japanese Navy. A single-seat, single-engine design featuring forward canards, twin vertical/horizontal stabilizers, a vectored-thrust engine nozzle and generous weapon carrying ability, the F/A-27C is a versatile aircraft.
