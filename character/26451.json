  "description" : "Tsurara is Mizore`s mother. Like her daughter, she is very shy and serene, including the tendency to hide behind corners and having a lollipop in her mouth. She comes to the Academy`s festival under the belief from her daughter`s stories that Tsukune is Mizore`s boyfriend. She has a bad habit of making sharp ice spears when she gets emotional. Tsurara is also an avid gun collector, with a wide variety of handguns and rifles stored in her home, once dreaming of becoming a spy.\nExclusively in Rosario + Vampire Capu2, Tsurara and Ageha hold a long grudge against one another, being rivals for the affection of a student during their days as students at Youkai Academy. She also runs a ski resort in the human world. Due to having a long-time grudge against Ageha, she is similar to the Goldie Hawn character Helen from the Robert Zemeckis film Death Becomes Her.",
