  "description" : "Private Schmidt was part of the engine room staff on board the Hameln II. A university graduate majoring in astrophysics, he was drafted into the military and ended up in a role which made no use of his skills.\nIn a twist of fate, the predicament of the Hameln II provided an opportunity for him to show his talent -- his careful observations of the red giant Altmuel enabled him to come up with their eventually successful plan to use the energy from its periodic solar flare eruptions to out-accelerate and escape the Alliance ambush.",
