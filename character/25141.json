  "description" : "Akira is the first member of the Shiseiten to appear in the story. He was a peasant boy whom Kyou found in a village that he completely destroyed. Though Akira was very young and the only survivor, he refused to cry and instead faced Kyou with the intention of fighting him. Kyou was impressed with Akira`s fighting spirit and adopted him, promising to make him the strongest man in the world - after Kyou, of course. He was nicknamed the Twin Headed Dragon for two reasons: one, because his techniques require two swords, called Chisakatana (小さ刀, lit. Small sword, one shorter than the second as noted by Saishi), and two, because of his two personalities. One moment he is docile, kind, and gentle, and in a flash, he is a blood-thirsty killer akin to Kyou himself. Akira was incapable of unlocking his full potential because he didn`t have samurai/noble blood, but he overcame this limitation by intentionally blinding himself. He gained the \"eye of the heart\", making him even more perceptive than those who can see.",
