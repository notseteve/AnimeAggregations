  "description" : "Satsuki is Hajiki`s younger sister. A dancer, Satsuki is convinced she will someday become a professional, if she gets a new leotard so she doesn`t look shabby in front of the other girls. Both Hajiki and her mother give her money for this, because it`s the one thing she likes to do, and they support her in that, even if they`re poor.\nSatsuki is always worried about her brother and knows he`s out getting himself in trouble, and has no problem shouting at him for being out too late and worrying their poor Mom. Katana takes her hostage to get to Hajiki.\nSource: wiki",
