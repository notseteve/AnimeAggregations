  "description" : "The 22-year-old head at the main Pantasia branch, and a Harvard graduate with a Food Science diploma (he had a girlfriend named Cathy there but they got separated when he had to travel back to Japan). His passion and talent is food tasting, at which he excels. His strait-laced no-nonsense attitude belies his very silly quirk of making strange pun-based reactions to the delicious bread he`s eating. He used to be the student of Ken, but Ken drove Ryou away with his behaviour. He is also one of the many people who make fun of Kawachi.",
