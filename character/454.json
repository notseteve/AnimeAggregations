  "description" : "Omanyte is a prehistoric Pok√©mon that is long extinct. Some can be revived using helix fossils, and a small number have been shown to be in deep hibernation. It lives in the deep in the primordial sea where it navigates by twisting its ten tentacles, and uses air in its shell to rise and sink. It eats plankton off of the sea floor, and withdraws into its shell to escape harm. Omanyte is based on the ammonite a creature which resembles it, and sounds similar in name.",
