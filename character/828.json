  "description" : "Houndour is a small, black dog with a red underbelly, resembling the Doberman and Rottweiler breeds in shape and coloration. Houndour is a nocturnal carnivorous Pok√©mon that organizes itself in packs. A Houndour pack works with perfect teamwork to pursue prey. Individual members of the pack approach the intended target from different spots and begin the hunt. They then communicate their location to each other using special howls, ensuring that the victim is eventually surrounded and unable to escape.",
