  "description" : "Tyrogue is a fighting Pokémon with three different evolutions, the first generation`s Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan, and one introduced in the same generation, Hitmontop. The Pokémon that it evolves into is based upon the attack and defense statistics of the Tyrogue at the point of evolution. Tyrogue is very energetic; it puts this energy into training. It constantly challenges, or randomly attacks, different Pokémon in order to get stronger, though it often ends up with injuries caused by much stronger Pokémon. Even if it loses, it will never give up on its training. If a captive Tyrogue doesn`t have various set training methods established by its trainer, it will often become stressed. Tyrogue and its evolutions are based as all male.",
