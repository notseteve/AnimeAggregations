  "description" : "Regigigas, known as the Colossal Pokémon, is one of the legendary Pokémon that premieres in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl; the name meaning king of the giants. It is similar to the three Regis - Regirock, Regice, and Registeel - in both name, body structure and the fact that all Regis are weak to Fighting-type attacks. It will only appear in the game if the three Regis, after being transferred via Pal Park, are in your party while examining Regigigas` body. Regigigas was sealed in the Snowpoint Temple for thousands of years, so long that moss have grown over its body, and modern humans thought it was just a statue of the Pokémon. A Sinnoh legend has it in the past Regigigas towed continents using ropes. The legend says that it had unbelievable strength, but seemingly since it has not used it in ages, it has trouble getting its act together at the beginning of a battle, evidenced by its ability, Slow Start. In Platinum, Regigigas` level is reduced to 1, making it the lowest level non-glitch wild & legendary Pokémon, more evidence of the fact that it has not used its powers for millennia.",
