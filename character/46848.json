  "description" : "Senritsu (Melody) is an Music Hunter and is the kind and understanding member of Neon`s bodyguards. She is always ready to listen to anyone`s confessions and has the gift to make people open up to her. As Leorio notes, she is one of the very few characters who has made Kurapika open up to her. Melody`s physical appearance is in short contrast to her kind soul. Due to effects of the \"Sonata of Darkness\", a musical piece said to have been written by Satan himself and possibly inspired by the Devil`s Trill Sonata, her body is a short and her face disfigured. However, she was not always like this; she was once a normal person. She was transformed when she and a friend listened to the Sonata of Darkness. It is composed of four parts: piano, violin, flute, and harp, and it is said that whomever listens to it will be greatly cursed. Melody`s goal is to find the sonata and destroy it. Melody has the ability to emit her aura to people to soothe ease fatigue when she plays an instrument. She also has a very sharp sense of hearing and can tell a person`s psychological state just by listening to their heartbeat. For example, she knows when people are lying or when someone has completely lost his/her temper.\nSource: Wiki",
