  "description" : "Known by ringnames such as the \"Executioner\" or \"Shinigami (God of Death)\" by those who watch his matches, Mashiba is one of the most intimidating boxers in the series. He effectively combines an inhuman reach and the offensive Detroit version of the Hitman stance that was used by the American boxer Thomas Hearns who ruled 5 classes of boxing weights by this style to create a devastating whip like technique known as the Flicker Jab to eat away at his opponent`s guard and resolve. Those fortunate and/or skilled enough to make it through his barrier-like Flicker still have to deal with his power-packed Chopping Right, which cuts down those who would deal damage up-close.\nVoiced by: Masahiko Tanaka",
