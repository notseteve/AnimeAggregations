  "description" : "Nikaidou Nozumu appears only in the manga and the movie. His lines are largely given to Yotsuya or Kentarou in the TV series.\nNozomu`s family name, Ni-kai-dou, means \"two-story temple\". In ancient Japan, two-story buildings were extremely rare, especially in the rural areas, and an occasional two-story building constructed at Buddhist Temples would awe the locals to such an extent that Ni-kai-dou would become the place name for the area.",
