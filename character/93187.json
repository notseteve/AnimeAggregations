  "description" : "Laeticia is an ordinary French girl who got dragged in the Great Holy Grail War, after http://anidb.net/ch58806 [Ruler] chose her as her possession vessel. She`s a decent and honest person who has no Magic Circuits, but her religious piety alone surpasses that of others. Though she has lived an extremely normal life, she loaned her body upon Jeanne d`Arc`s request. Her facial features and style is only partly similar to Ruler`s. Due the effects of the possession, her body was somewhat changed to match Ruler`s.\nDespite being dragged into the Great Holy Grail War, emotionally it was like watching a movie inside a dream for her. She served as the witness to Ruler and http://anidb.net/ch88726 [Sieg]`s relationship, and she was, in a certain sense, the final stronghold for Jeanne, a sheep that allowed Jeanne not to notice her own feelings of love.\nAfter Ruler left her body, her appearance returned to normal and her memories of the Great Holy Grail War vanished. Despite this, she found a direction for her prayers in the form of wishing that \"those two may find happiness together\", and she prays believing in such small miracles every day.\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
