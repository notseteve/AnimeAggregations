  "description" : "An ordinary student in Hojo High School. Since she carelessly offended Kai during her summer job, she becomes Kai`s Honey during this semester. At first Yuzuru doesn`t like Kai because he always finds ways to sexually harass Yuzuru (which makes her feel empty since she feels nothing but a play-thing), but later she finds out Kai harasses her because he likes her, and she realizes that she doesn`t mind it as much as she did before. Yuzuru`s parents are very greedy and rapacious; they are very poor as well. Yuzuru performs badly in both her studies and sports, and constantly refers to herself as \"such a measly Honey\" or \"a Honey like me\" (because she`s afraid of displeasing him, and not being the best she can be for him). She needs to be reassured occasionally that she`s not at fault and that even though she doesn`t do things the way other Honeys do, Kai still loves her and wants HER, not any other Honey. She detests Kai at first but finally falls in love with him later on. Since Chihaya once encroached upon her, Yuzuru is afraid of him. Throughout the manga series, Yuzuru and Kai remain in love despite what Chihaya does to separate them. Later Kai proposes to Yuzuru during a bath, and she accepts. They marry in the last chapter.",
