They brought back Pesu to http://anidb.net/ch1677 [Prince Hata] and http://anidb.net/ch1655 [Hasegawa] and were told cooking it in hot water will bring it to its normal size. Kagura, however, boiled it in a big pot of water, making it grow large. Pasu went on a rampage and was killed shortly after by Gintoki.",
