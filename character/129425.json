  "description" : "Ash, Goh and Chloe all met with the man to ask him questions about the mysterious Pokémon that he apparently saw on the Crown Tundra. He wasn`t too sure about the shape or color of the Pokémon. He initially thought it looked yellow, and then white and then both colors. The sighting was vague, probably because it was in the middle of a snowstorm.\nWhile not actually confirmed in the Japanese version of the episode or the credits, this characters design resembles the Freezington`s Mayor from the Pokémon Sword and Shield Crown Tundra DLC.",
