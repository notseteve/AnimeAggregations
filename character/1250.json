  "description" : "Magnezone, known as the Magnet Area Pokémon, is the evolution of Magneton, and has an appearance similar to that of a UFO. Magneton evolves from exposure to a unique magnetic field, which can only be found inside Mt. Coronet in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This causes a mutation in the Magneton; one of the Magnemite that this Pokémon consists of has grown bigger than the other two; its pupil has dilated and turned red; and the screw on top appears to have been replaced by a yellow antenna upon evolution. The remaining Magnemite form the \"shoulders\" of Magnezone, and the screws on the top of their head have grown significantly larger. They also appear to have lost one magnet each. Magnezone has three horse-shoe magnets. Two are positioned in a fashion that resembles a pair of claws, and a third is positioned as a tail. Its body is surrounded by a thin metal rim. It is approximately three times heavier than Magneton. The body has a silver color like Magnezone`s pre-evolved forms. \"Magneton must level up in Mt. Coronet in order to evolve\"\nIn Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness, a Magnezone serves as the police chief, taking away the outlaws the main character defeats.",
