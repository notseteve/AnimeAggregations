  "description" : "She is the landlady of the Izumo Inn who specializes in swordsmanship. She states she never refuses anyone needing shelter. However, she prohibits fighting and obscenity in her house, although she passively does wiretapping using a rubber duck speaker with glasses and a #2 on its forehead that she refers to as \"Duck-san\" (made by Matsu). She trains both Musubi and Tsukiumi to help them win the Sekirei battle. Whenever she becomes angry, annoyed, or if any person breaks the rules of the house, and when she is giving threats, a demonic visage appears behind her and is frightening enough to scare even Homura and Tsukiumi into submission.",
