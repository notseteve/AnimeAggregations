  "description" : "The Hyaku Shiki is a prototype machine created as part of the AEUG`s secret \"Zeta Project.\" Its name, which means \"Type 100,\" reflects both its model number and the ambition of its designer Dr. Nagano that this mobile suit would last a hundred years. Originally designed as a transformable model, the Hyaku Shiki`s transformation mechanisms proved to be defective, and it was redesigned as a high-performance non-transformable mobile suit. The Hyaku Shiki`s beam-resistant coating gives it an eye-catching golden exterior, well suited for the use of the AEUG`s principal pilot.",
