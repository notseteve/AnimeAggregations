  "description" : "Pandora`s Actor is the area Guardian in charge of the Treasury and finances of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick], who was created by http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Momonga] himself. He`s a high level Doppelgänger whose face is a simple egghead with three holes dressed in a Neo-Nazi-esque uniform but can transform himself into others, even copying their abilities and powers.\nIn Momonga`s original design, he`s the combination of everything that he thought was cool, with exaggerated gestures and body language but now that he is actually alive, he embarrasses Momonga. Despite his appearance and personality, he is on the same level as the Floor Guardians and is considered as intelligent as http://anidb.net/ch72778 [Albedo] and http://anidb.net/ch72782 [Demiurge]. He is granted permission to secretly call Ainz his father—secretly he does not want rumors of favoritism to spread.\nSource: Wikipedia",
