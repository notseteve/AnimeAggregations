  "description" : "Melpha is high-ranking priestess who is widely respected by her followers as a holy woman. Compared to the other competitors, her fighting ability in close quarters is minimal (she is only armed with a spiked flail and a small shield), but through the use of the \"Divine Power\", she possesses the ability to heal her own wounds and inflict divine punishment on her opponents through the use of provocative \"Holy Poses\". In the anime, Melpha idolizes Nanael as an Angel of Heaven, which Nanael abuses in order to boss Melpha around as a servant. Much like Cattleya, her breasts are larger than normal.\nSource: Wiki",
