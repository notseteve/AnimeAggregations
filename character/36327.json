  "description" : "The Fifth Branch Chef, he wears a jogging suit, sport shades, and some kind of shell with a mask made from the body of an IGO agent that he used his ability on. He has approximately 4,000 bones and 4,600 joints, which he can easily detach and manipulate to allow him complete mobility and flexibility. He uses this quirk for his Lodge, a technique which allows him to inhabit another creature, assuming its form. Even if his bones are broken and removed, he can manipulate the rest of his unnatural capacity to compensate, barring the sacrum. However, even if the sacrum would happen to be removed or dislocated, his body will adjust in time and repair the nervous system, this process takes time but will be fully healed afterwards.",
