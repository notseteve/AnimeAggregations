  "description" : "The captain of the kendo club. Energetic and enthusiastic, she dreams of leading the team to the nationals. Her family owns a deli named \"Chiba Deli\". Kirino is very happy that Kojirou has finally begun to put more effort into training his kendo team, but she is oblivious to the real reason that her teacher has suddenly begun to train the team so enthusiastically. She is proud that she is the captain of the kendo club and is more responsible than she appears (such as picking up the shinai when the other members leave them lying around on the floor). Kirino seems to find Tamaki quite adorable, as she and Sayako will often treat Tamaki as a \"little sister\" type. Despite that, however, she has great confidence in Tamaki. She is described as being the heart of the group by Kojirou.",
