  "description" : "Mokona is a mischievous, nonsensical rabbit-like creature, with a striking similarity to a manju bun, with a red gem in his forehead above his eyes. From this gem he can produce a tent for the Magic Knights to sleep in, food, and other necessary supplies. Unlike the nearly identical Mokona Modoki/Soel from xxxHOLIC and Tsubasa Chronicle, he is unable to speak, and is limited to making `puu` sounds, however Fuu is somehow able to understand him.\nThis Mokona is quite distinct from Soel, even though they have nearly identical appearance. The dimension witch Yuuko hints that her Mokonas, Soel and Larg, were based on this original creature from Cephiro.\nMokona is named after Mokona, one of CLAMP`s artists.",
