  "description" : "Minegenius is a mysterious witch that http://anidb.net/ch141210 [Kurumi Mirai] met when she was younger. She gave Kurumi a magic notebook urging her to become a magician one day.\nIt is implied that she is the same person as http://anidb.net/ch142074 [Minami Suzuki] (both also being voiced by http://anidb.net/cr61 [Horie Yui]) but the exact circumstances as to why she appears different are unknown (it is worth noting that Minami Suzuki`s appearance resembles that of http://anidb.net/ch147221 [Hazel], with whom Minegenius attended the Rettoran Magic Academy).",
