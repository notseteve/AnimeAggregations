  "description" : "Sawako is a shy yet honest girl who is in search of friendship, but her resemblance to horror film character Sadako and Sawako`s tendency to shy away from correcting people of misconceptions prevent her from doing so. Thanks to Kazehaya`s kind and open nature, she is able to gradually make friends, open up to her classmates, and talk to different people. She is grateful (and at first, worships) Kazehaya for giving her the opportunities to make close friends, which come to include Yano, Yoshida, Kazehaya and Ryuu.",
