  "description" : "Angela is a 16-year-old girl, who is Tsubasa`s subordinate, who Yoichi described as being as tall as a model with a dynamic body. Initially Angela was hired by Sakinomiya Ukyou to assassinate Yoichi. She has been observing Tsubasa, because she thought that the next heir of Tsubame Tenryu Ryouge should assassinate Yoichi.\nAfter she witnesses Tsubasa`s lack of interest in proceeding with the job, she ripped off Tsubasa`s clothes so she would turn into a deadly weapon. But the fight between Tsubasa and Yoichi was interrupted by Washizu. After Tsubasa left because of the embarrassment, Angela followed her and was in deep shock after hearing Tsubasa say that she hates both martial arts and Angela. She attempted to assassinate Yoichi that night by herself but that fails. Ahe explained everything to the Ikarugas about the assassination plot and her assassination attempt. Yoichi lectured her about her mercenary ways and that she should use her martial art skills with pride as a member of the Tsubame Tenryu Ryouge as well for the revival of her martial arts school. After that, she left the house and encountered Tsubasa, who had already forgiven Angela for her previous actions. Angela started a ramen shop with Tsubasa the next day. Angela also likes Yoichi romantically.\nSource: Wikipedia",
