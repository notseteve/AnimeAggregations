  "description" : "Vulpix is a fox-like creature with six curled tails, based on the Japanese fox spirit kitsune. Most commonly female, Vulpix are especially known for being beautiful. As Vulpix undergo Pokemon evolution, their red fur turns pale yellow and they grow three extra tails. Vulpix usually have a friendly, if not spoiled, temperament. Because of the flame in their bodies, when the temperature outside increases, they let flames out of their mouths to prevent their body temperature from getting too hot. In the wild, Vulpix will feign injury to escape from more powerful predators.\nDuring the first season of the Pokemon anime, Vulpix appears often as one of Brock`s Pokemon. It was given to him by a girl named Susie who felt she could not take care of it well. Brock, who felt he was only \"babysitting\", gives it back to Susie in the season four episode called \"Beauty and the Breeder\".\nIts Japanese name, Rokon is a portmanteau of six (六, roku) and kon (from kon kon, an onomatopoeic word describing the bark of a fox), or an alternate reading of the Japanese word for kitsune (狐, kitsune), meaning fox - in this case, the reading is ko (こ). Its English name may have been derived from the scientific name for a group of foxes, Vulpes.",
