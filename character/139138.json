  "description" : "Part of the eldritch Flood, this creature is responsible for much of the events of Halo, and was even responsible for the temporary truce between the Spartans and the Covenant.\nDuring the Forerunner-Flood War, the first known Gravemind came into existence as a centralized intelligence to coordinate Flood efforts against the Forerunners. Eventually Forerunner space navy tactics began to fail. The Forerunners developed the Halo Array as a desperate countermeasure, which would destroy all sentient life in the Galaxy, thus denying the Flood “food” for growth.",
