  "description" : "Kaji is a boatman who transported Team 7 and Tazuna to the Land of Waves. Whilst travelling, he left the boat`s motor off so that they could slip in without being heard. With the same reason in mind, he scolded Naruto for shouting whilst near the bridge. He was able to take them to the edge of the Land of Waves, at which point he turned the motor on and left, wishing the group luck on their journey.",
