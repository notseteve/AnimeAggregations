  "description" : "Considering how well she maintains herself, it is difficult to believe that Akie is Kaoru`s actress mother who divorced Kaoru`s father five years ago when Kaoru was delivered into B.A.B.E.L. stewardship. Considering the time frame, it is not that much of a stretch to surmise that Kaoru`s father has either been driven off or killed by Kaoru`s Level 7 telekinesis going out of control which frightens Akie right out of administrating over her younger daughter`s childhood development in contrast to Minamoto actually setting limits for Kaoru -- and enduring the verbal and telekinetic objections thereof. Akie`s inability or unwillingness to see Kaoru as her daughter that happens to be an esper leads her to behave a heavy emphasis upon her work.",
