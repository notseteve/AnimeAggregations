  "description" : "Minatsu is the student of Kazemi affiliated junior high class 1-1, a robot who runs on bananas, but claims to hate them. She is upset over the fact that she is a robot but does not have a rocket punch. Like the android Miharu from `Da Capo`, one of her power sources is a spring motor that needs to be wound periodically (also with a key inserted into a hole on her back), though doing so causes Minatsu to experience a sensation similar to Sexual arousal. In the first season of the anime, Minatsu is friends with Yume. She also claims to hate humans in the beginning stages of the anime but starts to fully understand that not all humans are like that.",
