  "description" : "Patrat, known as the Lookout Pokémon, is a rodent-like Pokémon that resembles a chipmunk. It continues keeping watch for several days, saving up food in its cheek pouches. It signals to its companions with its tail. They are extremely wary and keep watch outside their burrows in turns. They become anxious if no one keeps watch.\nPatrat first appeared in the first few episodes of the Pokémon: Black and White anime. Multiple Patrat made a brief cameo in Black and White episode 3 with multiple Pidove and Deerling where they needed help from Ash and his friends. In the Pokémon Master Black & White manga, Monta captures a Patrat in the first chapter.\nPatrat and its evolution Watchog were called \"fairly unremarkable aside from their intense facial expressions\" by GamesRadar`s Carolyn Gudmundson. Gudmundson later noted it as a \"Bidoof analog\", in spite of the fact that it can only learn one Hidden Machine, whereas Bidoof can learn many. She adds that it is very easy to become bored of it. Official Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling commented that Patrat was the \"new Bidoof\".",
