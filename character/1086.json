  "description" : "Beldum lacks a circulatory system of blood. Instead, it is powered by a strong magnetic force. It can exert magnetic forces from its body in order to communicate with others of its species, and can even communicate with brain waves. Beldum move together in a synchronized pattern, attracted by the magnetism of one another. They can repel Earth`s natural magnetism with their own, allowing them to levitate. Beldum live on cliffs by planting their leg into the cliff-rock. Ash captures one in a city.",
