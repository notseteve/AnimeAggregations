  "description" : "Dontores is the original Rumble King whose Regalia is placed on his forearms rather than the AT like Yoshitsune. He is considered the weakest member within Sleeping Forest by his teammates (though probably not including Ine). In the past, he was possibly a famous rapper, continuing to hold concerts during his time with Sleeping Forest. Using his regalia he manipulates the density in the air creating solid defensive walls that can push back his enemies, and in enclosed spaces he is able to use the echoes generated off the walls to amplify his power many times over. This helps him generate dense blasts of air to hammer at his opponents. It is called his \"audience of the overroad\" since the echoes respond like the audience of a crowd of tens of thousands of people. When not in use his regalia is disguised as a boom box which he carries across his shoulder.",
