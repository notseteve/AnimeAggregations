  "description" : "An incredibly powerful robot found with D. It sat dormant in the EDF`s headquarters for years until Kazuki awakened it during Rara`s assault.\nZinv has many unique abilities revolving around the manipulation of gravimetric forces, including gravitational projectiles, super speed, and crushing enemy mecha. Zinv also comes equipped with a nano-repair system that can fix any damage inflicted. Zinv only responds to Kazuki`s Life Sympathy, and sometimes activates itself when Kazuki is not aboard.\nZinv defeats the lesser version of Himiko quite easily, but Himiko`s final form takes the upper hand. When D removes the limiter preventing males from piloting it (Kazuki skirts this by BEING Zinv), Zinv instantly repairs itself and generates Light Hawk Wings. With this newfound power, Kazuki decimates Himiko and creates a black hole, reducing the Rara fortress to nothing.\nWith the two worlds dangerously close to oblivion, Zinv and Kazuki agree to destroy Zinv, ensuring that both worlds will live on. However, Zinv survives the explosion that consumes it, regenerating at the bottom of the ocean and returning to Kazuki in the third universe.\nFollowers of Tenchi Muyo! will recognize the Light Hawk Wings, as well as the Zinv look-alike in Tenchi Muyo GXP.",
