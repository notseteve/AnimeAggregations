  "description" : "The oldest member of the Casull children. She is a powerful magic-user and able to cast spells faster than many others. She has assumed a motherly role in the family and always maintain a calm, kind attitude. She is Shannon`s sister and Pacifica`s foster sister. Like Shannon, she has a striking resemblance to Celia and Beckenham Mauser`s sister due to the genetic engineering used in their birth. It is however noted that she is often left the odd one out because of Shannon and Pacifica`s close relationship. She doesn`t seem to mind, but she is considerably less close to either of her younger siblings as they are to each other. But in some episodes it can be seen that she is actually concerned about Pacifica, for example when they went to the cave of bugs to look for plants for Pacifica`s antidote, she actually says that she didn`t mind the risks because her sister`s life was in danger. Raquel often encourages Shannon`s close relationship with Pacifica by sending her brother out to look for and comfort Pacifica. She`s quite the type of comforting Pacifica by doing something not by telling it. And despite her kind, calm and sometimes goofy nature, she will not hesitate to strike down anyone in her way of protecting Pacifica or Shannon. Raquel`s normal kindness often serves as a cover for a more aggressive and tactical mind that asserts itself whenever Pacifica or Shannon are in danger. As the oldest, Raquel prepaired her father, Yuhma, for death and lit the pyre.",
