  "description" : "Haruka works at Fuhshin Shinbun. She is an avid drinker of sake, and as such is usually drunk. While intoxicated, she will often make advances on the other women, especially younger girls. For this, Kana fears her greatly. She attends college, studying bio-fermentation, and creates numerous different beverages from biologic substances (the resulting concoction almost always being alcoholic), which she tests on her friends.",
