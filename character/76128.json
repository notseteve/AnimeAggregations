  "description" : "Sacred Heart is Vivio`s Intelligent Device. Vivio additionally gave it a \"mascot name\" Chris, which she uses most of the time. Its standby form is a plush bunny that floats in the air to follow Vivio, and it does not change its form when it is activated but grants Vivio stronger magical power and control to let her maintain the Adult Mode.",
