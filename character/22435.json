  "description" : "Duplica introduced herself as from the House of Imitay which is known for imitating. Duplica likes to dress up and change into costumes so she can imitate people like Officer Jenny and Nurse Joy. Duplica explained to Ash and his friends that she wants to become the greatest Ditto Master and a big star, not a Pokémon Master like Ash. Duplica is known for her perky and curious personality. She also has a large wardrobe of clothes that she uses as costumes so she can transform her looks.\nWhen Ash and his friends first met Duplica, she was training her Ditto which was having problems transforming perfectly. Her Imitehouse theater wasn`t getting any patrons because they didn`t want to see a Ditto that couldn`t transform perfectly. Team Rocket appeared and stole Duplica`s Ditto and tried to get it to transform. It wasn`t until Meowth threatened to use its claw on Duplica`s Ditto that it finally was able to transform properly. Duplica`s Ditto tried to transform again and was able to transform perfectly from that point on. Duplica was very grateful and thanked Team Rocket for getting her Ditto to transform perfectly.\nDuplica reopened the Imitehouse theater after her Ditto could transform perfectly in the hopes that passing travelers would visit and watch her act with her Ditto.",
