  "description" : "The young daughter of a viscount who falls in love with William. Her feelings for William are often reinforced by misunderstandings from William`s courtesy and accommodation. Though her family is of the peerage, her family`s financial situation is deteriorating. Due to this, her father very much wants Eleanor to marry into the wealthier, but lower class, Jones family.\nEleanor is a very shy girl, yet in the same time she always tries to catch William`s attention, for example by inviting him into a tea-party in her mansion, and visiting to William`s mansion for `seeing the rose blooming`. She is very shy whenever William is around, yet finally she was able to tell him her feelings when they were watching opera. She is (almost) always accompanied by her faithful servant Annie, who takes care of her since she was a child (in the 4th volume of the manga, it was shown that since Eleanor was still a child Annie has been serving her.)\n(Wikipedia)",
