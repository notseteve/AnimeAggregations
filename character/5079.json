  "description" : "Nakasato Hikari is http://anidb.net/ch5077 [Kenji] and http://anidb.net/ch5080 [Suzuka]`s older cousin. She is short and has long, golden-brown hair done in twin tails; because of her childish behavior she is http://anidb.net/ch39853 [sometimes] mistaken for a middle schooler despite being one year Kenji`s senior. She is somewhat quick-tempered, stubborn, and a tomboy. Hikari may be annoying but she really cares for her cousins and http://anidb.net/ch5078 [Nanami], and is willing to help them when they`re in trouble. She is often pestered by Kenji`s friend and classmate http://anidb.net/ch30241 [Hatano] who is crazy about her every time she visits her cousins during summer; he would do anything for her to the point of becoming her slave, and she gleefully takes advantage of this. She loves spicy foods, milk and carbonated soft-drinks.",
