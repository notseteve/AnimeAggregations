When she went to have her gym battle with Elesa that she had booked, she noticed that Elesa was at a fashion show and decided to go watch her. Ash and his friends also decided to watch her as well as Cilan suggest that it would be a good idea to go to find out what kind of person she was. While modeling on the catwalk, Elesa spotted Pikachu and noted she had never seen a Pikachu before and noted it was sparkling and shining.\nGym Battle against Bianca\nBoth Bianca and Ash wanted to do their gym battles right away but because Bianca had made a reservation and Ash hadn`t, Bianca was first. Elesa suggested to Bianca that their Gym match be a test so show her father how much she`d grown since she`d started traveling. Ash realized that Elesa was being fair and noted that he should have made a reservation too. Elesa battle against Bianca was a lot easier than she anticipated and none of her Pokémon were knocked out.\nGym Battle against Ash\nAs she had just finished a gym battle with Bianca, Elesa told Ash she`d be waiting for him the next day for their gym battle as she had to take her Zebraika to the Pokémon Center. The next day, Ash proved to be a lot tougher to battle against as his Pikachu 1-hit knocked out Elesa`s Tynamo and Elesa`s Emolga on his way to victory. Elesa was extremely impressed with Ash and his Pikachu after the battle.",
