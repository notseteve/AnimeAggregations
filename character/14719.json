  "description" : "This second-year student is the chief editor of the Cinq Lumi√®res Tsuushin (a school paper). She tends to appropriate the paper for herself a little. Her name is a pun of masukomi (mass communication/media). Mika gets close to getting her \"scoop\" on the Pretty Cures, but is always distracted by Nuts` human form, making the next day`s paper all about him and her and reducing the article on the Cures to a small, almost unreadable size.",
