He and Koharu now form the Konoha Council. He is a target for http://anidb.net/ch7719 [Uchiha Sasuke]`s assassination. Ever since their childhood, Homura and Hiruzen Sarutobi have been close friends. Under the guidance of the Second Hokage, http://anidb.net/ch8862 [Senju Tobirama], they and their third teammate, Koharu Utatane, have completed numerous missions together. When Hiruzen became the Third Hokage, Homura and Koharu became his councilors. With their years of experience and knowledge and their unending effort to make Konohagakure a better place, they eventually gained similar respect and social status as the Hokage himself. Thanks to his prudence and efficiency, Homura especially has gained the absolute faith of the Konoha shinobi.",
