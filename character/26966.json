  "description" : "Takeda Ikki, also known as Takeda the Puncher, is part of the Three Man Army with Kouga and Ukita and used to be a rising boxing star. However, an incident where he came to the aid of his friend caused harm to his left arm, leaving it paralyzed. He fights Ken`ichi to test how strong Ken`ichi is, but Ken`ichi defeats him by attacking his lower body, which is a boxer`s weakness. Ken`ichi spares him and takes him to Akisame`s clinic, where Akisame fixes his left arm. Takeda acknowledges Ken`ichi`s strength and quits Ragnarok to become a pro boxer once again. He later joins the Shinpaku Alliance and comes to Ken`ichi`s aid on several occasions.",
