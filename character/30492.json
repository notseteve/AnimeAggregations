  "description" : "After Burgh`s Dwebble was defeated by Ash`s Sewaddle, Burgh`s Whirlipede was sent out to battle Ash`s Sewaddle. Ash had not encountered this Pok√©mon before on his journey and he quickly pulled out his dex to learn some information about it. Burgh`s Whirlipede`s Steamroller dealt significant damage to Ash`s Sewaddle and Burgh thought he could finish off Ash`s Sewaddle with a SolarBeam but Ash`s Sewaddle evolved right after the attack finished. The battle quickly changed due to the evolution as Ash`s Swadloon`s Energy Ball, which it had just learned, was a useful attack allowing it to defeat Burgh`s Whirlipede.",
