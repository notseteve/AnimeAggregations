  "description" : "The Anti-United Nations Forces arose from resistance to a single unified world government, a proposal in which many of the world`s nations wished solidarity against the possibility of invasion by aliens following the revelation of the crashed Alien Space Ship-1 on South Ataria Island. Backed by several of the world`s most powerful countries, the Anti-United Nations Forces have a long history of espionage. So it was with little surprise the U.N. Government`s development of the http://anidb.net/ch49024 [F-203 Dragon II] fighter based on OverTechnology from the Alien Space Ship-1 was followed by the Anti-United Nations development of their own aircraft with OverTechnology. The Mikolev MIM-31 Karyovin was also a delta wing craft and the A.U.N.`s answer to the http://anidb.net/ch49024 [F-203]. Using most of the same materials, the Karyovin was a comparable aircraft and was a step ahead of the conventional aircraft of its time.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/karyovin.htm",
