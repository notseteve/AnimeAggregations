  "description" : "A nameless entity who was conceived by http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] and http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca] shortly before the eclipse, corrupted by the semen of http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith] when he raped Casca after his ascension as http://anidb.net/ch2050 [Femto]. This resulted in the child being born prematurely as a disfigured fetal abomination that appears at night, acting of instinct to be with his parents, following Guts for two years before traveling to be by Casca`s side as her protector.\nProtecting Casca drains the Child of his life force, and he is near death by the time the http://anidb.net/ch91831 [Egg of the Perfect World] consumes him so neither of them would die alone. As a result of the Egg`s action, the Child became the vessel of Griffith`s new physical body.\nBut the Child`s presence still lingers on in Griffith, compelling him to protect Casca during Guts`s fight with Zodd. It would later be revealed that Child is able to regain use of his body on the night of a full moon, traveling to wherever Guts and Casca are in the form of a raven-haired youth. During the nights he is able to appear, the Child helps Guts and his group during their journey to Elfhelm.\nWikipedia",
