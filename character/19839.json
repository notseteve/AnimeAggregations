  "description" : "Julie Makimoto, Julie Heyward in Japan, is a 12 1/2 year old girl from Australia who tries to stay happy even when the worst has happened (for example, when Billy ended up under the control of Masquerade); she acts happy after something bad happened but she generally does that just to cover up her true feelings. Julie forgets things easily, proving that she is a little scatterbrained at times. In the Japanese version, Julie spices her speech with American phrases, differentiating her personality from the others. She is a Subterra battler and her guardian Bakugan is her Subterra Gorem. Gorem then evolves into Subterra Hammer Gorem. Julie has a sister named Daisy who has bested her in everything since she was a child. She reached 8th in the rankings. She chose not to brawl against Zenoheld in the final showdown as Gorem did not want to put her into trouble. She returns in Gundalian Invaders as a neighbor of Dan`s once he moves. She works at a cafe and in episode two it is revealed she is a cheerleader for the team Jake plays for. This strongly suggests she is already in high school in her first year with Dan. She`s believed to be about 16 years old.",
