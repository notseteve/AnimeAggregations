  "description" : "The president and owner of the ghost sweeping agency Mikami GS, a strong-willed first class Ghost Sweeper, 20 years old. She was initially trained by the pastor father Karasu, but unlike her mentor, she was not satisfied with a life of poverty. Although she is wealthy from the success of her exorcism business, she is stingy when it comes to paying her employees, and often gouges her clients for a higher fee.\nWith her motto being \"the current profit comes first\", her motivation is not to help the people in need, but to earn the big money and to chase after the thrill. Her biggest weaknesses are small children, cockroaches and the thought of not being able to earn money.\nEven though she would never admit it, she does show feelings towards Yokoshima. The two are revealed to have been connected together in a previous life and are told that they will most probably marry in the future.\nSource: Wiki",
