  "description" : "Ryuu is very intelligent and handsome, and his dark background somehow links him to the organization known as Pluto. When his parents died, Pluto took care of him. As a child he was never allowed to socialize with others. He often viewed his house as more of a prison than a home. Even with his cold personality he is still friendly with the other members of Class Q, and shares a special link with Kyu, since he was the first one who could understand him. He admits that Kyu is smarter than he is despite his childish behaviour. Ryuu also has a Pluto mark on the back of his neck, which is seen at the Last Opening Video of Detective Academy Q.\nSource: Wiki",
