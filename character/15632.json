After Nanami became a vampire, he goes looking for her in the subways where he was nearly attacked by one, if Vera didn`t stop him. He later goes to help Mina and Akira to save Nanami, where she blurted out her true feelings for him without realizing that he was there. After reciprocating these feelings, he allows himself to be turned into a Vampire by Nanami so he could live with her in the Bund.",
