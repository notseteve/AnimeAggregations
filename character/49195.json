  "description" : "When testing the next generation of advanced variable fighters and other spacecraft, the U.N. Spacy often employs various unmanned fighter craft as material for space flight exercises. In the early 2040`s an unmanned version of the VF-11 produced by the UN Forces saw active use in such test exercises. The cockpit pod is removed and is replaced by an automated control module. A simpler forward nose with smaller canard wings is installed and two smaller sensors are fitted on either side of the forward nose. This new autonomous hardware is used to control the craft without the need for a pilot. A set of FAST Packs (without armament or missile launching ports) is installed to provide optimal performance for the target craft in space. Once complete, the VF-11 unmanned target craft can be launched and take part in any test exercise required. During the 2040 space combat trials of the http://anidb.net/ch48628 [Ghost X-9] Fighter in Earth orbit, the U.N. Spacy made use of dozens of these VF-11 unmanned target craft to act as stationary and mobile targets for live fire tests.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/vf-11-target.htm",
