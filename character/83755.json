Kind and strong-willed, she is most beloved by her people and is forced to take command of her country`s defense when her http://anidb.net/ch84454 [father] dies from illness shortly after the beginning of the Germanian invasion of Elystadt.\nFiine and http://anidb.net/ch83754 [Izetta] met in their childhood, but instead of being afraid, Fiine came to admire Izetta`s magical powers and became her closest friend, even once shielding her against a peasant mob after Izetta had inadvertently set a shed on fire. Because of her affection for her, she is reluctant to send Izetta into battle, fearing for her safety.\nSource: Wikipedia",
