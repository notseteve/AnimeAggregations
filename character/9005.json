  "description" : "This form was first achieved by Gokuu when battling Baby Vegeta. Throughout mid Dragon Ball GT (after the Baby Saga), Super Saiyan 4 became Goku`s weapon of choice as the villains became even stronger. After being pushed to the limit by Baby, Golden Great Ape Goku transformed into a Super Saiyan 4 after Pan calmed him down. In this form, Goku completely dominated Baby (none of the villain`s attacks could even hurt him) and eventually finished him off with a 10x Kamehameha wave.",
