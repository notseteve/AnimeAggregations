  "description" : "Sylveon (ニンフィア), the Intertwining Pokémon, is a Fairy type Pokémon and a brand new evolution of the first generation Pokémon Eevee. Its type was kept a mystery until the official reveal. Sylveon possesses abilities to move its antenna-like ribbons on its body which uses it to relieve the feelings of both humans and Pokémon. Also the ribbons act as a leash when it walks with its trainer. Sylveon can learn a new Fairy-type move, Moonblast, that allows it to borrow energy from the moon and attack the opponent with a powerful blast.\nSylveon appears in the short feature Pikachu and Eevee Friends that accompanies the film Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened in theaters, wherein it is voiced by Shoko Nakagawa.",
