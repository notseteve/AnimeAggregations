  "description" : "Hun is a member of Team Rocket. He appeared along with his partner, Attila, in \"The Legend of Thunder!\".\nLike the other Rocket duos, his and his partner`s names together form the name of a famous historical villain, in this case, Attila the Hun.\nHun and Attila both seem somewhat set in their rank, and approach missions casually. They seem to be able to keep their cool even when they lose; even in these situations, they calmly retreat. Despite physical stereotypes, Hun is the dominant partner telling Attila to do things that he could do himself. Attila doesn`t object or show any signs of aggravation over this role.\nAttila has no recorded history with his partner Hun though, while the dub states that they are new partners, their body language and the familiarity of the behavior towards each other shows that they do have some history together.\nThe pair takes mission orders from Professor Sebastian, but it is implied in the original that they have never met him before \"The Legend of Thunder!\". Still, in the dub, he seems to have some kind of friendship with the professor.\nHun was male in the original Japanese version. However, his gender was controversially changed to female in the English dubbed version. Closer analysis showed that Hun was never referred to as a female (but he has long hair and bangs, a feminine hairstyle in some countries). The only pronouns are those used collectively with Attila, such as \"those men\" or \"those guys\". So, Hun may just be a male with a female voice. In the Brazilian version, however, Hun was referred to as ela and dela. Likewise, in the European Portuguese he is named Ana, which is a name that usually is given to woman.",
