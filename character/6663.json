  "description" : "While the Titans` transformable mobile suits prove to be very effective in battle, their complexity and high performance make them unsuitable for the average pilot. As a result, the Titans develop this final mass production model, a non-transformable machine with better performance and cost-effectiveness than the AEUG`s Nemo. However, only limited numbers of these formidable mobile suits have reached the battlefield by the time the conflict ends.",
