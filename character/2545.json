  "description" : "Al is a fifth-grade student living at Side 6`s Libot space colony. To distract himself from his parents` strained relationship and his own troubles at school, he spends most of his time collecting military paraphernalia with his friends and trading breathless stories of the ferocious battles taking place outside the neutral colonies of Side 6. Al`s fascination with war takes a new turn as the conflict begins to directly affect his home colony.",
