  "description" : "A new model of transformable mobile suit designed for aerial combat and classified as an Aerial Maneuver Attacker. Currently being deployed as a successor to the DINN, the BABI has far greater firepower than its predecessor. In mobile armor form, its high speed and the anti-air weapons installed in its wings make the BABI an effective interceptor, and in mobile suit form it can use the Ardor beam cannon in its chest to attack and destroy large ground targets.",
