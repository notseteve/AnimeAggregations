  "description" : "Vittorio is extremely strong warrior from Ancient Rome who was designated to fight for the princess of his kingdom, Sandra. He fought endlessly for her sake in constant fear that if he were to lose a single fight, the princess would have to marry the winner. He was eventually chosen by a fragment of Innocence one thousand years ago due to his prayer of not wanting to lose the princess at a temple, leading to his title \"The Millennium Swordsman\".\nVittorio refused to fight any woman who tried to fight him. Because of this, http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee] couldn`t help http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda] and http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]. The Innocence he carried allowed him to remain ageless over hundreds of years and kept him from noticing that the kingdom and princess he had sworn to protect have already disappeared a long time ago.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
