  "description" : "An organisation led by Ikari Gendou and tasked with defending Earth against the Angels through use of the Evangelion units. It was formerly known as Gehirn, a UN Research Agency. It was reorganised into Nerv once Nerv HQ and Tokyo-3 became fully operational. There are several global branches of Nerv besides the main headquarters under Tokyo-3 itself.\nThe Nerv Logo is half a fig leaf covering its name, with the motto \"God`s In His Heaven... All`s Right With The World\" forming the quarter circle on the bottom. The motto comes from Robert Browning`s poem \"Pippa Passes.\"\nIn Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their \"nakedness\" with fig leaves. The fig leaf has covered nakedness in art and sculpture for hundreds of years, symbolically representing the guilt of original sin.",
