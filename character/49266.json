  "description" : "Like the UN Spacy from which their technology derived, the Varauta (Protodeviln) also adopted the military protocols of their enemy. In doing so, the Varauta built specially enhanced versions of their variable fighters for use by team leaders and squadron commanders. A variant designated \"F\" was built from the standard Fz-109 Elgerzorene heavy variable fighter and fleet leader Gigile pilots one such fighter in his battles against the UN Forces. The Fz-109F variant fighter features an incredible increase in firepower with four additional laser guns, one additional barrel to the rear rapid-fire laser gun placement and two medium-scale missile launcher bays. The \"F\" variant is also built with more powerful engines that not only compensate for the additional weight, but improve speed beyond the standard Elgerzorene model variable fighter. Gigile` leads the Varauta Army forces in his Fz-109F Elgerzorene, a very distinct sight upon the battlefield in a deep maroon colored hull.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/fz-109f.htm",
