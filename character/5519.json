  "description" : "Nyx is a young woman who, as a child, was once a peasant girl in the service of Count Vance. She was looked down upon and despised by those of higher station, and was frequently humiliated and abused by the Count`s daughter, Elina. However, her life changed when she stumbled upon Funikura, an evil sentient staff, and was granted immeasurable magical powers. The staff also gives her a split personality: one with the kind and timid side she was born with, and the angry and vengeful side developed through the mistreatment from her career as a servant by Elina (when injected with Funikura`s liquid). However, she is unable to control them effectively, and despite possessing a strong sense of justice, she is just as likely to set an entire village aflame to punish its evil leader. She takes on a gaudy clothing style mannerism so as not to be overlooked by her former tormentors, but the malevolent will of the evil staff she struggles to command continues to oppress her by sexually assaulting her. She entered the Queen`s Blade tournament to prove her worth to those who have looked down on her through her whole life, as well as seek revenge against Elina, her former tormentor.\nNyx is named after the Greek goddess Nyx, who is known as the Goddess of the Night.\nSource: Wiki",
