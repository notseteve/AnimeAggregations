  "description" : "Envy is a genderless (though is referred to as `he` as well as `it`) homunculus who has the ability of shape-shifting. It uses this power to assume the form of any person and even copy their voice.\nEnvy is most comfortable in the \"adorable\" and \"beautiful\" form of an androgynous teenager. It usually serves as a spy, but abilities are also extremely useful for assassinations, as demonstrated by the murder of http://anidb.net/ch6590 [Maes Hughes]. Envy`s most frequently used assassination technique is to impersonate someone whom the target loved or cared about, and use the target`s hesitation as an opportunity to kill him or her. Envy may not be as smart as some of the other Homunculi, but is by no means an idiot. In fact, it can be just as good a puppet master as http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust]. But this is overshadowed by its cockiness and bad temper. Its temper can easily be set off by insulting his large and delicate ego, causing it to make mistakes.",
