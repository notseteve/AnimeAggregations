  "description" : "A servant at Weda`s parent`s estate, he has very scary eyes (though it wasn`t always the case, was stated to have beautiful eyes when he was younger). Loves Weda, but she thinks of him as a brother. He is often the one who goes to pick up Weda after nights where she had been drinking specifically heavily (revealed to be quite frequent due to Weda`s habits). Often coming up with ideas that seem not to be possible, Har√© is put off by him from their first meeting.",
