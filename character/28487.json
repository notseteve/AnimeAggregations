  "description" : "Mukai Kozue is a student in the cram school Manaka and Toujou attend during their second year of high school. Although she has an attractive body, she has a chronic fear of males, freezing up and even cowering in terror in their presence. Ironically, she also tends to have very vivid romantic fantasies with those she fears. She quickly falls in love with Manaka, the first boy she feels comfortable enough to talk to. She appears to be an extreme version of Toujo; she is far more shy and reserved, and falls over just as often.",
