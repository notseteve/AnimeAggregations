  "description" : "Rider of Black was http://anidb.net/ch89997 [Celenike Icecolle Yggdmillennia]`s Servant, but became http://anidb.net/ch88726 [Sieg]`s Servant after Celenike`s death.\n[spoiler=\"True Name and Noble Phantasm\"]His true name is Astolfo, one of the Twelve Paladins of Charlemagne. Among his fellow paladins, he is said to be the most handsome, eternally optimistic and completely lacking in sense. As the legends go, Astolfo was quite the ladies` man.\nAstolfo has created many legends as he was an adventurer who flew to all over the world and even reached the Moon in the end. Through his journeys, he had won numerous Mystic Codes such as his flute, his grimoire, and his shining golden lance. Astolfo brought rise to various legends on the back of mounts like a griffin and the famous Rabicano, but particularly famous among them is something inconceivable for this world—the Hippogriff.\nAlthough many are the glorious tales of Astolfo, it is said that he has made just as many mistakes. He was continually defeated in riding tournaments, fell victim to many thaumaturgical traps and even lost—in a matter of hours—the reason that he had picked up at the moon. However, Astolfo never faltered; he did not seem to consider failure or defeat as blunders in the first place.\nHis Noble Phantasm is Trap of Argalia, which can disable any living thing with a touch.
