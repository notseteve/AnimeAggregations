  "description" : "Junichirou is a young man around Najimi`s age who she first met in an adult game store while she was buying one such game to help her with drawing her doujinshi. He later became her first customer the first time she was selling her doujinshi, though he was the only customer at that time. Later, when Najimi gets a job at a cosplay restaurant, he appears there every day, eventually making Justice believe that he stalks Najimi due to him showing up so often. He does in fact have a crush on her, and has to persevere against Justice`s antics to get close to her.",
