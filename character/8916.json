  "description" : "Aeka is typically shown as the beautiful first princess of the planet Jurai who has fallen in love with the title character, Masaki Tenchi. Aeka is portrayed as being modest, well mannered, traditional, and aristocratic, but can also be snobbish (her proper accent is evidence of her aristocratic upbringing). She can also be very fierce when she feels that anyone or anything she cares for is in danger, such as Tenchi or her younger sister Sasami, of whom she is very protective.\nAeka is a rival of Ryouko for Tenchi`s affections. Often the conflict between the two comes out of their decidedly different personalities and backgrounds, with Ryouko being more blunt, open and sexual in her attempts to gain Tenchi`s love. The level of the rivalry can vary between being equatable to a pair of bickering siblings to an all-out feud. Ryoko`s teasing and efforts often bring out some of Aeka`s worse aspects. However, there are times when Aeka puts aside her rivalry whenever Tenchi is in danger, such as the battle with Kagato.",
