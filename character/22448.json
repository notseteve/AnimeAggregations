  "description" : "The Hippie is a calm, old man who plays the PokéFlute. In exchange for his concerts, he expects visitors to repay him with some food. However, usually his visitors pass on by without giving him anything.\nThe Hippie has befriended a Snorlax that eats and sleeps. If the Snorlax is causing trouble (blocking something important), it can easily be awaken with the use of the PokéFlute. In the episode \"Wake Up Snorlax!\" a Snorlax was blocking a town`s water supply, causing crops to dry out and food to be scarce. The old Hippie used his PokéFlute to solve the problem.\nThe Hippie also has a job of waking up many Snorlax. He owns a device that tells him when a Snorlax needs to be awaken.",
