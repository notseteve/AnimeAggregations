  "description" : "Godai Yuusaku is the protagonist of the series. He begins as a poor 20-year-old rounin studying for his college entrance exams after failing in the past year. He eventually gets into a third-tier college (with Kyouko`s help). He is kind-hearted and handsome, but indecisive and spacey.\nYuusaku is often played by the other tenants of Ikkoku, who habitually take advantage of him (e.g. they use his room for frequent drinking binges and steal food from his care packages).\nHe falls in love with Kyouko at first sight, but lacks the courage to tell her how he feels. Instead, he daydreams a lot and does numerous silly things.\nDuring the course of the series Yuusaku matures into an honorable man who becomes worthy of Kyouko, as his love for her grows from an infatuation to a lasting and devoted love.\nHe lives in Room 5 (Go).",
