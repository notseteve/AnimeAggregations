  "description" : "Ul is a very powerful ice mage that trained both Leon and Gray. While Ul and her first apprentice Leon were walking through a town where the evil demon Deliora had just rampaged they found one lone survivor who happened to be Gray. From that day on Ul had trained both the boys to become ice mages and even began seeing them as her own two sons.\nIt was later revealed that Ultear is Ul`s daughter and Sieglein commented that if Ul was alive, she would most likely be one of the Ten Holy Mages.\nUl died in a battle with Deliora that was caused by Gray. He had run away from Ul and challenged Deliora himself. That forced Ul to use Iced Shell to freeze her opponent forever, freezing herself in the process.",
