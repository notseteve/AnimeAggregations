  "description" : "While taking a recreational stroll while struggling with his graduate research, Clemont encountered this Kolink in the park and quickly took it to Nurse Joy. It was quite weak so it took a while for it to recover but Nurse Joy made a suggestion that it would be nice if there was a place in the town where Electric Pok√©mon could freely absorb electric energy. This became Clemont`s project and he befriended Kolink.\nDuring his research and development stage for the Citronic Shower, Kolink often visited Clemont and tested the experiment. Upon graduation, Clemont was planning to ask Kolink to be his my partner and come with him to Miare. He even got a cake with blended just the right amount of sweetness for Kolink but Clemont was sidetracked by the Mayor of the town and he missed his meeting with Kolink.",
