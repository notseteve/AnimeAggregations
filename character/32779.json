  "description" : "Chaoji Han is a 20 year-old crew-member of a ship helping the Exorcists to Japan and is one of surviving shipmates after the ship is lost to sea after an Akuma attack. He was raised by http://anidb.net/ch32776 [Anita], a supporter of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order], after his mother was killed by an Akuma and he becomes extremely loyal to Anita and the crew of her ship; he develops an extreme hatred of all Noah and Akuma even after their deaths, going so far as to accuse http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen] of being evil for sparing the life of http://anidb.net/ch7370 [Tyki Mikk].\nHe is later discovered to be an Accommodator, and he happily becomes an Exorcist under http://anidb.net/ch32784 [General Tiedoll] to avenge those he lost at the hands of the http://anidb.net/ch9471 [Earl].\nHis Equipment-type anti-Akuma, the Arm of Baptism, grants him superhuman strength. It appears as a pair of gloves with buttons on each knuckle and cloth-like extensions at the wrists. When revoked, it takes the form of two linked bracelets on his left wrist.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
