  "description" : "She is Kaname`s older sister. She is a lazy ditz but, Kaname considers her on the \"genius side\" for her great learning capacity. In contrast with that, she usually misunderstands important things and she gets really confused in the blink of an eye. Her favourite hobby is probably playing video games and she usually nags Kaname into playing with her.\nSource: Tonikaku Kawaii Wiki",
