  "description" : "Slugma is a diurnal slug-like Pok√©mon made of lava. It usually lives in areas of great heat, because it requires heat to live. It can only be motionless for an amount of time if it stays near heated areas. If it strays from a heated area, it must remain in constant motion, or its skin will harden. If it stops moving in this case, it will die slowly from starvation. Despite this, Slugma has the ability to harden at will for protection.",
