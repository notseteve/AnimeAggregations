  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch10207 [Canti], when an enemy is sited, loses control of himself and turns red. In this mode he is the opposite of his normal shy and obedient self - a true fighter. In addition, though he can fight on his own, he needs a \"pilot\", that must literally be eaten to assume his position in the \"cockpit\".\nOnly in this form he can transform in a cannon.\nThere are some strong hints in the plot, that Canti is being controlled by http://anidb.net/ch10127 [Atomsk]. Actually, this state is his original, that was \"cut off\" by http://anidb.net/ch5487 [Haruko] when hit on the head.\nLater on revealed that Cannon-form uses the pilot as the ammunition for shooting. This is a joke-reply by GAINAX to the Xenogears game by Square, which was heavily influenced by http://anidb.net/a22 [NGE] and where one of the strongest attacks was shooting the pilot as a bullet from the transformed mecha.\nPossibly, only with N.O.-capable pilot Canti gains the ability to open N.O. channel to transport matter (Atomsk`s guitar and later himself).",
