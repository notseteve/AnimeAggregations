  "description" : "The Conbinart Three Star Factory Ship is largely an immense cluster of factories encircling a large-scale OverTechnology reactor. The Factory Ship is designed for function over form and as new facilities are constantly added the vessel is left looking somewhat haphazard in appearance. The Three Star can produce any product the fleet requires from ammunition magazines to complete space warships. To disperse the incredible amount of heat produced during operation, the Factory Ship has a 15 kilometer long heat dissipation film that trails behind the ship.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/threestar.htm",
