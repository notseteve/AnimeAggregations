  "description" : "An artificial sphere 45km in diameter and weighing 40 trillion tonnes, Geiersberg (Vulture`s Castle) was an Imperial fortress in the same class as http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn], though smaller in magnitude. Its primary armament, the Geiers Haken (ガイエスハーケン, Vulture`s Claw) was an X-ray beam cannon with a wavelength of 100 angstroms and a total power output of 740,000,000 MW, comparable to Iserlohn`s Thor Hammer. Its hangars could berth a fleet of 16,000 ships. The surface was composed of alloys, ceramic and hydro-metal.\nDue to the gradual sublimation of some of the fluid metal over the course of the years since its construction, the surface had acquired a skeletal appearance, with various \"pools\" or \"lakes\" of fluid metal. One of these was thought to resemble a vulture, leading to the fortress acquiring its fanciful name.\nIt was used by the high nobles as their headquarters during the Lippstadt Rebellion. It was later augmented with 12 warp engines, as per http://anidb.net/ch218 [Admiral Schaft]`s plan, allowing it to warp into the Iserlohn Corridor and mount an assault on Iserlohn. For this operation, it was placed under the command of http://anidb.net/ch190 [Admiral Kempf].",
