  "description" : "Originally the leader of an Ikaruga unit, Tager suffered a mortal wound during the Ikaruga Civil War and was forced to withdraw. He was revived as Iron Tager, an enormous cyborg, by Kokonoe whom he pledged loyalty to afterward. After his revival, he bears a similar resemblance to a demon, which resulted in him dubbed as the \"Red Devil of Sector Seven\". He is feared by many, but in truth he is very calm and calculated, only engaging in violence when necessary. He has resumed his duties since his revival as a cyborg and is currently not only pursuing Hakumen, but also Ragna as a secondary target. In the true ending of Continuum Shift, he and Makoto travel with Noel to Ikaruga after Noel has been saved by Ragna.\nSource: Wiki",
