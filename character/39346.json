  "description" : "The head of the Long Clan and formal leader of colony A02026. His granddaughter Meilan was married to Chang Wufei, making him related to the future Gundam pilot in a way. When Operation Meteor`s true form was revealed, it was planned for A02026 to be the colony dropped on the Earth, an action that Wufei greatly opposed. Before the brash young man could leave, Shirin gave him the clan`s heirloom, a jade statue of their guardian, the two-headed dragon Altron, to sell for supplies. In the series, Wufei returns to the colony after receiving Altron Gundam to rediscover his purpose. When OZ attacked A02026 to root out the Gundam, Shirin activates the colony`s self destruct system to keep his people out of OZ`s hands, and to give Wufei a reminder of what he`s fighting for.",
