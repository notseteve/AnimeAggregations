  "description" : "The Great One (known as the Shin`ou) is the first King of Shin Makoku. His soul watches over the lands of Shin Makoku, and priestess such as Ulrike and Ondine can communicate with him in a limited fashion, one they call \"hearing His Majesty`s voice\". Murata also appears to be able to communicate with him, and is often seen scolding him for meddling in Shin Makoku`s affairs.\n4000 years ago, the Great One sealed the Soushu into four boxes, which became known as the \"Four Forbidden Boxes\". However, while part of the Soushu was sealed in the boxes, a small part of the Soushu infected the Great One to the extent where his right arm seemed slightly decayed. The Great One knew that the Soushu would eventually take over his mind and body completely, so the Great One came up with a plan along with his Great Sage to completely eradicate the Soushu in the future. This involved sealing the Soushu with a pure soul, and destroying it. This soul turned out to be the Great One, but Yuuri manages to eradicate the Soushu without harming the Great One, earning Yuuri the title of the greatest Maou. The Original King commented that he was glad he chose Yuuri as the Maou.",
