  "description" : "The \"maid guy\" of the title, a towering, superpowered man in a maid uniform. Kogarashi is boldly confident in his numerous Maid Guy abilities, from cooking & cleaning to USB connectivity and X-ray vision, even claiming to have 37 senses. He is extremely loyal to Naeka, but unafraid to criticize her faults. Ironically, Kogarashi himself lacks any regard for personal space or decency. He is as much a source of problems for the Fujiwara home as he is the solution. Fubuki even notes to Zenjurou that to Naeka that using Kogarashi to protect her is like using poison to fight poison.",
