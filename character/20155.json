  "description" : "Aoyama Mio is an elitist daughter of Aoyama Central Industry`s president. She is imperious and disdainful, being from a wealthy family; however, not known to the public, she is no longer rich—a secret which Keima discovers after stalking her to a shabby apartment. Despite her financial situation Mio continues to think of herself as a rich woman and is unable to let go of her late father`s memory. In order to get closer to her Keima took on the role of her chauffeur and driving her to school in various rickshaws. He then confronts her at an evening party, convincing her to accept the past and move on. Keima encounter Mio several chapters later, while occupying Yui`s body and learns that instead of him meeting her at the party, she remembers her old chauffeur Morita.\nThe prototype version of Mio appeared in Tamiki Wakaki`s one-shot Koishite!? Kami-sama!!, with her surname being Tsumagawa.\nHer name comes from Aoyamacho Station (青山町駅, Aoyamacho-eki).",
