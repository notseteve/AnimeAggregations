  "description" : "A highly intelligent high-tech robot injected with the personality data of http://anidb.net/ch17304 [Professor Hayashi], this model resembles human beings the most. Data corruption led it to stage a coup d`etat to establish a `nation of robotic maids` to accompany his dead daughter whose personality data the living http://anidb.net/ch17304 [Professor Hayashi] has injected into http://anidb.net/ch7827 [Tama]. It was able to think up of the plan to gather all the robots, all the while making use of Professor http://anidb.net/ch17299 [Meguro] to implement it, and even killed http://anidb.net/ch17299 [Professor Meguro] in the end.\nNo. 502 has the ability to regenerate itself no matter what kind of damage it suffers. Its data chip is only 1 micron in size, making it extremely hard to pin-point and destroy. Its arms can turn into long-range sharp weapons which it can manipulate at will, and its eyes have the ability to track and analyze moving targets.",
