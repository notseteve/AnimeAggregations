  "description" : "Unnamed and known in the manga as only as \"Princess\", Tamao is the fianc√©e of Ranmaru because of an arranged marriage by both their parents. She is extremely wealthy and studies at an all girls` school. Aside from hoping Tamao`s calm demeanor will change Ranmaru`s womanizing habits, both Ranmaru`s parents are extremely fond of her and would like her to become their daughter-in-law. Her character is a perfect example of a \"lady\" as she foils Noi`s loud mouth and Sunako`s un-ladylike nature. Despite Ranmaru`s playboy qualities, she has fallen in love with him, to the extent of admitting her feelings. His rejection of her does not faze her, hoping that eventually he would come to feel the same way.",
