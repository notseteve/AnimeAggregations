  "description" : "Seadra was Mandi`s second choice of Pokémon after his Exeguttor was beaten by Ash`s Krabby which, after the victory had just evolved into Kingler.\nSeadra charged quickly towards Kingler whose attempted to counter with a water gun was dodged. As Seadra got closer, Kingler changed its attack to a Bubble and managed to send Seadra skywards as it could not dodge and maneuver around the attacks.
