  "description" : "Shiina is a female ninja who fights with dual-wielding kodachi and shuriken. She is able to sense when danger is coming and is a highly capable fighter. Despite her serious demeanor, she has a weakness for cute things like stuffed animals. She is strict in her training and is very self-critical when she fails, especially to a newcomer like http://anidb.net/ch12094 [Otonashi]. She rarely speaks but will normally remark that those around her are \"shallow-minded\" whenever the obvious or something stupid is said.",
