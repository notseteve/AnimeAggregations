  "description" : "A female officer of XAT. She is Hermann`s partner, and Malek`s adoptive sister. She is hesitant in her orders to kill Blue/Joseph, and after Malek is turned into a Demoniac, attempts to stop XAT from killing him. When almost all XAT officers and civilian personnel were killed or turned to Amalgams, Amanda was one of two human survivors along with Hermann, and the only one to apparently save herself when the helicopter used in their escape was destroyed. She was later admitted into Zwölf and offered a role as an operative, although she accepted only for Malek`s sake, proudly stating that so long someone from XAT lived, XAT itself continued to exist. During the chaos that preceded Xargin`s assault, she stormed Zwölf`s HQ with Hermann and rescued Malek, turning to her aunt for protection and shelter. She stayed there when Joseph went to his doomed fight with Xargin, and in the years later she managed to rebuild XAT, serving as an instructor to the new task force. Following Joseph`s death, after the end of the series, she becomes the new pilot of GARM and thus Elea`s partner.\nWhile Amanda is an ordinary human, she shows a high degree of experience in firearms and melee fights similar to her former colleagues. Also, after the destruction of XAT, she becomes the pilot of her team`s lone remaining Paladin, which is embedded with the names of her deceased friends as a memento of their sacrifice.",
