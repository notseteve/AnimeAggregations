  "description" : "A powerful demon with the ability to read fate. He is one of the four Holy Ones. He has known Ginshu since he was a child.Their first encounter he had tried to kill her, but found out that it was futile (as she had said she was just a decoy for Shinshu). He was very fond of Ginshu (it was mutual) but unlike Ginshu, he did not like to openly admit it and often spoke to her rudely. He spent most of the winter as a child playing with Ginshu in various games. However, their relationship changed drastically after the priestess of the Sakigami shrine severely injured Tsuyukusa. A bloody battle took place, and as Ginshu and Byakuroku killed each other, a deal was made with Heaven, so that Shinshu`s power was transferred to Bonten, and he replaced Byakuroku taking his place as Heaven`s Seat.",
