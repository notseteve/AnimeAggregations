  "description" : "Aki Honda was the leader of a gang of middle-school bullies whose favorite victim was Hiroko Kaizuka, whom they often tormented out of jealousy for her high grades, which skewed the class`s performance numbers against them. Aki was such a terror, boys in the class feared her, and one member of her group often faced as much bullying as Hiroko herself, for merely expressing mild opposition to some of what they did.",
