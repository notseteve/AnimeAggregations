  "description" : "A girl band always searching for that sparkling, heart-pounding beat, based on Kasumi`s (Gt. & Vo.) childhood observation of the stars shining in the night sky. The other four members are music-lover Tae (Gt.), shy but confident girl Rimi (Ba.), kind and family-oriented Saaya (Dr.), and constant contrarian Arisa (Key.). They have band practice in Arisa`s basement, and what they lack in skill and experience, they more than make up for in gusto.\nSource: bandori.fandom.com",
