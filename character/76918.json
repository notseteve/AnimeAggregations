  "description" : "Count Pump is the master of a castle in the Kalos region. He is fat and his appearance resembles a Pumpkaboo. The prince had fallen in love at first sight with Jessie`s Pumpkaboo and ordered his butler to invite them to the castle to be introduced and to have a meal. Upon meeting them, Pump noticed that Jessie`s Pumpkaboo was a truly excellent Bakeccha and that he`d never seen such a big one before.\nHe then asked Jessie to trade her Bakeccha so that the prince could wed her. Despite initial hesitation, Jessie agreed and traded her Bakeccha for his Kucheat because he told her that it is a Pok√©mon reported to mega evolve. During the trade process, Jessie`s Pumpkaboo evolved into Jessie`s Gourgeist. Pump then realized that Pumpjin is a trade evolution and the prince liked the way Bakeccha looked better.\nAfter Rocket Gang reveal themselves as the true villians, Pump apologized to Clemont and friends for erroneously attempting to take Pikachu and Clemont`s Chespin who was dressed up as a Pikachu for the festival. He then invited them to a meal at the castle to make it up to them.",
