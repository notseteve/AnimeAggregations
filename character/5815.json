After Wakaba`s death, Akaishi switches to catcher to fulfill Wakaba`s last dream in which Kou pitches to him at Koushien. At the start of high school, he refuses to take Coach Daimon`s placement test and is placed on the prefab team with Kou, and plans the boys` strategy to get rid of Daimon. Kou describes Akaishi as a brilliant catcher, and according to Aoba, Akaishi is one of the few people able to catch her pitches at full power. Coach Maeno sometimes consults with him over game strategy, and makes Akaishi the team captain during his third year. He is greatly shocked when he meets Akane Takigawa because of her resemblance to Wakaba, and while he has feelings for her, he actively works to bring her and Kou together.",
