  "description" : "Professor Marble works as the head researcher at the Tesseed Laboratories in a port city near Tachiwaki City. Professor Marble was initally away on an academic meeting when Ash and his friends as well as Georgia were taken on a tour of the facility by Clay. When he arrived back at the laboratory, he noticed something was very wrong and quickly ran inside to see what was going on.\nHe was able to quickly diagnose the problem as he realized that the Tesseed that absorbed the power of the Electric Stones were the ones creating the outbreak of moss. He then concocted a medicine from the extractions of Lum Berries and Mago Berries blended with White Herbs which he told Nurse Joy (Isshu) how to make and treated Pikachu with. He then figured out how to stop the Tesseed from continuing to create moss by putting them under containment and letting them discharge the electricity. The plan was a success and he apologized to his Tesseed for making them suffer and to everyone else for all the trouble.",
