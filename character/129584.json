  "description" : "Ilima`s Kangaskhan is one of Ilima`s Pok√©mon, probably caught in the Kalos region. It can Mega Evolve.\nIt battled against Guzma`s Scizor in the Top 16 round of the Alola League. Initially Scizor wasn`t able to land attacks, but then its strategy changed as Guzma made sure that Scizor always lined up in front Kangaskhan and its little one to use it as a shield. Kangaskhan was always worried that its attacks could hit the little one and because of that its moment were too slow. Despite Mega Evolving during the battle, it couldn`t keep up with Scizor and it lost the match.",
