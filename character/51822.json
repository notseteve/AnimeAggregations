  "description" : "Rumi is a girl who transferred into Kouhei`s school. She used to be in the kendo club but had to quit after hip complications. Her goal is to become a \"true maiden\" and to that end, she behaves maidenly toward those around her, but she shows her true character just to Kouhei who leaves a terrible first impression. She does not belong to any club, but she tries to join in literature activities. She likes her old school`s uniform, and even though she has the new school`s uniform in her possession, she continues to wear her old one. She is bad at putting her own hair into pigtails.\nSource: Wikipedia",
