It defeated Noivern in a highly contested battle but once it finally it with Ice Beam and caused ice to build up on its wings, it fell into the stream and Weavile finished it off with a Night Slash.\nThe second opponent it faced in the finals was Ash`s Hawlucha who was out for revenge after Ash`s Noivern was knocked out plus it had a move type advantage as Fighting type moves are super effective against Weavile. Weavile tried to turn the match around by freezing the stream on the battlefield but it backfired as Hawlucha used it to its advantage and then went on the offensive and finished off Weavile with a Flying Press.",
