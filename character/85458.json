  "description" : "Lavi is a cheerful 18-year-old red-haired Exorcist of mixed heritage. He aims to become a Bookman, a person who records the hidden history of the world, and has been trained from a young age to achieve that goal. He travels extensively with the http://anidb.net/ch7367 [Bookman Senior], archiving various instances of history from a supposedly non-interferative standpoint. He is later shown to possess heightened combat and intuitive skills, and extremely photographic memorization abilities.\nLavi is the 49th alias he assumed after casting away his real name to reach that goal. He works alongside the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order] just to be close to the events that must be seen, but slowly becomes more attached to his friends in Black Order, and his original Bookman self is constantly being clouded by his growing care for them.\nHis Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, Iron Hammer, often referred to as \"Big Hammer, Little Hammer\", is capable of growing and extending to undefined sizes and lengths. The weapon allows him to use \"Seals\" that control several elements of nature.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
