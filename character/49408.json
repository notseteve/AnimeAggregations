  "description" : "Though serving as an entertainment vessel, the Hollywood Amusement Ship (ship class unknown) is actually much more. Designed as the eyes and ears of the fleet, the Hollywood is a collection of sensors and communications systems. The whole of the ship is a massive antenna with a largely hollow interior. The Hollywood is equipped with a powerful fold communications facility for broadcasting within the galaxy network signal and the actual communications and transmitting/receiving system accounts for only a small portion of the internal space within the ship. There are several theme parks within the hollow interior and thus these facilities have given rise to the perception of the ship as an amusement center by the civilian population of the 37th Long-Distance Colonization Fleet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/hollywood.htm",
