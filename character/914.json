  "description" : "Dustox is a moth-like Pokémon and one of two flying insect Pokémon forms that Wurmple can eventually evolve into, the other being Beautifly. Dustox`s green wings are coated with a fine and powerfully toxic dust which it uses to defend itself and deter bird Pokémon that might attack it. It feeds on leaves on trees it seeks out with its radar-like antennae, and it is instinctively attracted to bright light like many real moths. Swarms of Dustox can end up attracted to the bright lights of major cities at night, and end up causing unintentional havoc with the trees of those cities.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Dustox becomes Jesse`s primary Pokémon for use in Pokémon contests early on, and is often treated as a rival to May`s Beautifly. Jessie often tries to cheat with her Dustox, however, they still seem to always lose to May`s Beautifly. Jessie later releases Dustox so it could be with its mate.",
