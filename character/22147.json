In addition to the standard linear gun, the Moebius Zero is equipped with a set of wire-guided gunbarrels, which can overwhelm enemy mobile suits with a simultaneous multi-directional attack. Mu La Flaga, one of the few pilots capable of operating these gunbarrels, earned the nickname \"Hawk of Endymion\" by using his Moebius Zero to destroy five GINNs in a battle on the lunar surface.",
