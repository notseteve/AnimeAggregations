  "description" : "The members of the LXE (the League of Extraordinary Elects) serve as the main antagonists for the first half of Buso Renkin, and consist mainly of humanoid homunculi. The organization was formed by Dr. Butterfly a hundred years ago when he found Victor injured, and pledged to heal him in exchange for his alchemic knowledge. The LXE was formed specifically to protect Victor until the treatment was complete. While most of the organization are homunculi, the LXE also employs humans as \"Familiars\", who are lowest in their hierarchy. These Familiars either use their influence to protect the LXE, such as spying, controlling large crowds through propaganda, or other grunt work, with the aim of becoming a humanoid homunculus. When a Familiar`s work is completed, either in success or failure, he or she is devoured. Because all the members of the LXE are either human or humanoid, they can use Buso Renkin; however, according to Kinjo, very few members receive kakugane, typically only those high in the ranks. The Hayasaka twins were granted kakugane to defeat Kazuki and Tokiko.",
