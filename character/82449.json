  "description" : "Nina is a member of Luca`s group of traveling prostitutes. She`s a relatively selfish and cowardly person. While she means well, she is too afraid to stand up for others for fear of punishment. On a few occasions, she lashes out at both Luca and Casca, but she is quick to cry and apologize for it.\nShe suffers from an undefined infection. One several occasions she had persistent vaginal bleeding along with purulent discharge. This suggested a sexually transmitted disease; however, there was no evidence that Joachim or any of her other customers suffered from it, nor that Luca prevented her from continuing to work when she could. Due to that, she is ever worried that she will die soon. She has very little hope for a long future, and many of her decisions are based on immediate results.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
