  "description" : "It`s one of Langran`s four Masoukishin, and is also one of the seventeen Masouki that were designed to fight against the revival of Volkruss and its minions.\nIt`s been blessed with protection from the Wind class` Saint Grade spirit, Cyfith. This Masoukishin is one of the fastest units ever created, and the only one to gain the ability to transform. In Cybird form, it allows the Cybuster to have even more speed and agility, which also allows it to travel at high-speeds in any atmospheric areas.\nThe Cybuster is basically equipped with same system equipment as other Masouki, but what makes it different is the Laplace Demon Computer; a computer system which is sought out by many, as it has the power to foretell the future.\nDuring one of its early appearances on Earth, the Earth Federation designated this mech as AGX-05, which was later declared a misnomer, seeing as the Cybuster was also fighting against the Aerogators.",
