  "description" : "Sasa Kanako is a short, energetic girl who thinks of herself as everyone`s friend and becomes distressed when her friends fight among themselves. She acts as a mediator between her friends in such times and tries not to leave anyone alone. She has been friends with http://anidb.net/ch21555 [Yoshino] since pre-school, and later becomes close with http://anidb.net/ch23419 [Chizuru]. Sasa, as she is often called, is an innocent, childish girl who does not have many worries aside from her friends` quarrels. She tends to be a handful for her mother, who picks out her clothes for her and even helps her get ready for school in the morning. She mentions that if she thinks too hard about something, her brain becomes itchy.",
