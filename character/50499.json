  "description" : "The VF-0D Phoenix is a two-seat variant of the standard VF-0 variable fighter and features larger main wings for improved range. For maneuverability, the VF-0D has two large canards mounted ahead of the main wings and two ventral stabilizers near the intakes. The increased surface are of the main wing allows the VF-0D to carry 20% greater maximum payload than the VF-0A/S variants and is capable of mounting most former United States/NATO standard aviation weaponry. http://anidb.net/ch14110 [Kudou Shin] and http://anidb.net/ch14116 [Edgar LaSalle] piloted a VF-0D during the events surrounding the island of Mayan in 2008.\nNOTE: During development of the Macross game for the Playstation 2, when the VF-0 was being considered for inclusion, it was named \"Phoenix\" (ultimately, the VF-0 was not included in the game). This \"pet name\" was then dropped only to reappear in 2008 on the official Macross Frontier website. The Macross Chronicle (2008) has since made the name \"Phoenix\" official.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/vf-0d.htm",
