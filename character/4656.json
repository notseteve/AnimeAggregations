  "description" : "Blue Breaker (also known as STW-9000) is an infamous auto-enforcer created by The Third. Blue Breaker has a complex AI system and a fighting prowess far beyond normal auto-enforcers. He also has a stealth coat, an energy field that makes him completely invisible - which means that many of his victims never see their killer. A cold assassin with no remorse, he is The Third`s final punishment for those who refuse to follow the law.",
