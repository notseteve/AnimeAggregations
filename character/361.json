  "description" : "Ryouko appears to be a compassionate and hard-working high school girl. One of Kyon`s friends, Taniguchi, places her in the top three first-year girls in the school with a grade of A++: indicative of her pleasant personality, beauty, and athleticism. Her enormous popularity made her the unanimous choice for class president of Kyon`s homeroom class. She also showed particular concern about how Haruhi had distanced herself from the rest of the class.",
