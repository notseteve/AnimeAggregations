He was tricked by http://anidb.net/ch91215 [Cartaphilus] to kill cats in order to create a potion to strengthen his wife`s body. Instead, she melted and he became mad.\nStill, he believed that he can still cure his wife, so he continued killing cats. The First Cat King stopped him and he and the remaining cats devoured Matthew. He became part of the stagnation by the lake with his wife as a core.\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki, edited.",
