  "description" : "Kamijou Touma is the main protagonist of Toaru Majutsu no Index and a recurring character in its spin-off Railgun.\nHe has the lowest psychic rank possible at Level 0— largely because the people testing psychic abilities cannot detect or classify his abilities. Due to this, the founder of Academy City considers him neither a Psychic nor a Magician but rather a normal person with a unique ability.\nActually his power is Imagine Breaker (幻想殺し, Gensou Goroshi, \"Imagine Killer\"), a power which negates all magic, psychic, or divine powers but also his own good luck. He tends to stay away from trouble but possesses a strong sense of justice, albeit somewhat shallow and dogmatic. In order to save Index from the need of a memory reset, he had activated her self-protection system and destroyed the spell responsible for her mind strain but ended up losing all of his past memories, including everything about Index, when he came in contact with Feather of Light (光の羽, Hikari no Hane); this remains a secret to everyone except himself, the doctor that takes care of him (who is, unknown to Touma, the Heaven Canceler) and later Mikoto in the sixteenth novel. Though he no longer remembers the past, he has not completely forgotten the people he cares about.\nThroughout the series, he tries to live his life normally while still facing against the many adversaries from the worlds of science and most of the magic and the conflicts that follow. Despite his very bad luck, he has managed to get the interests and hearts of many ladies who are infatuated with him, which Aisa jokes about, that his life is like a dating sim where he is bound to unlock more paths to more girls.",
