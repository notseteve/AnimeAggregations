Before joining the Order, he worked for Black Order supporter http://anidb.net/ch32776 [Anita], along with his friends http://anidb.net/ch83358 [Maosa] and http://anidb.net/ch32790 [Kie], who also joined the Order as Finders after Anita died.\nHis Equipment-type anti-Akuma, the Arm of Baptism, grants him superhuman strength. It appears as a pair of gloves with buttons on each knuckle and cloth-like extensions at the wrists. When revoked, it takes the form of two linked bracelets on his left wrist.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
