  "description" : "Relius Clover is one of the main antagonists of the series and is also Carl and Ada`s father, and Ignis` husband. He`s a genius alchemist known as the Puppeteer. His experiments include the creation of Nox Nyctores named Deus Machina: Nirvana, which he harvested his daughter`s body to create. He completed this project with help from Kokonoe of Sector Seven. His own puppet, the Fluctus Redactum: Ignis, was created from the body of his wife, Ignis, who is similar in appearance to Nirvana. He was also involved with the creation of Murakumo Units. Relius is seen alongside Phantom and the Imperator of the Novus Orbis Librarium. He is also working with Hazama to achieve his goals, which at this point are unknown.\nSource: Wiki",
