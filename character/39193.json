  "description" : "Matsumi Yuu is a third year at Achiga Girls School. Yuu is the older sister of Matsumi Kuro and the fourth member to join the new club. When she was younger she wanted to join with the others in the mahjong club but she felt it would be awkward because she was older. Yuu is very sensitive to the cold, so she covers herself head to toe when she goes anywhere.\nSource: Saki Wikia",
