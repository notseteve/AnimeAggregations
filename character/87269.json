  "description" : "Yaha-kui Zashunina A being from a separate spacetime known as the \"anisotropic\" whose intention is to accelerate the evolution of humanity. He chose to enter Japan due to the strong feeling of the Japanese that they are superior to other countries.\nHe progressively introduces four devices to humanity:\n\n* Kado (a cube with powerful computing capabilities),\n* Wam (a pair of spheres containing infinite energy),\n* Sansa (a cross-sectioned brain which induces a sense of the anisotropic when looked at) and\n* Nanomis-hein (a fragmented sphere which can alter mass, inertia and gravity).\n\nWhile not posing a threat initially, Zashunina later reveals his true forceful nature in achieving his goals.\nSource: Wikipedia",
