  "description" : "The third Steel Angel built on the design by Dr Ayanakouji, she was activated by the Academy to destroy Kurumi. She is very strong due to being installed with two Angel Hearts instead of one (however this also means she is exempted from following the orders of Dr. Walski, her creator). She is very temperamental, devious, and has occasionally shown traits of sadism (shown explicitly during the time she held Saki hostage). She later joins Nakahito and the group, originally to figure out Kurumi`s power, but she eventually develops a crush on Nakahito.",
