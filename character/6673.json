  "description" : "This huge transformable mobile armour is a handmade creation of the brilliant Paptimus Scirocco, constructed aboard the transport ship Jupitris during its round trip to the outer reaches of the solar system. The Messala`s powerful engines are designed to counter the pull of Jupiter`s gravity, and its mega particle cannons and missile pods give it firepower comparable to that of a space warship. In its mobile suit form, the Messala`s beam sabres, forearm claws, and grenade launchers make it a formidable foe in close combat as well. As Scirocco continues his mobile suit development efforts, he hands this early work down to a succession of his loyal followers.",
