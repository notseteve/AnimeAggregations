  "description" : "Anna lives with her grandpa in the mountainous area of the Unova Region. She met Virgil and his Pokémon when they had to land near her house to do repairs. She looks up to her grandpa but she is a bit of a trickster and a bit naive still. She fed him some lunch but initially tricked him by giving him a spicy sandwich made from Matoma Berries. One day when she was hiking in the mountains with her grandpa, the cliff gave way and she began to slide down. Mooland came to her rescue but just as she was about to be rescued by her grandpa, the cliff also gave way on him and they all fell off the cliff. They ended up being saved by Mewtwo. Many of the Pokémon of the forest near her house are all friends with Anna. She asked them to help find Mewtwo so they could give it a Revival Herb.",
