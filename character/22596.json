  "description" : "Umberto lived on an island where there were many Kabuto fossils and he beleived that should the fossils ever be disturbed that the moon would turn red and the island would sink into the sea.\nWhen an expedition team led by Nurse Joy arrived on the island, Umberto tried to ward them off the island by attempting to make a boulder fall on the team.\nAsh managed to track Umberto down and he admitted that he was not trying to harm them, just warn them away. Nurse Joy did not beleive the tale of the red moon and continued looking for the Kabuto fossils.\nAfter the expedition team disturbed the fossils the moon turned red and the island began to rumble and the island began to shake. The team did not have time to reach their boats so Umberto told them to build rafts from the trees and managed to sail away from the island along with Ash, Tracey, Misty and the expedition team.",
