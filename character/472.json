  "description" : "A boy from another underground village, Adai, in which the people worship the Gunmen as gods. A modest but intelligent person, he`s often seen looking after the young Gimmy and Darry. When the twins are chosen to leave the village, he decides to go with them, thus the trio joins Team Gurren. Before he leaves, the village elder gives him a book that seems to withhold some secrets from humanity`s past, with the task to find someone able to read it, as no one in his village can decipher its content. After Kamina`s death, Rossiu temporarily begins piloting Gurren in his place, though initially has trouble, due to Simon`s breakdown",
