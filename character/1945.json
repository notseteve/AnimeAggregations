  "description" : "The one who gave Shiki the \"Mystic-eye-killer glasses\" (which she stole from her sister) to prevent him from seeing the lines of death. She is also the one who taught Shiki to value living things, whether it be humans, animals, or even plants.\nIn the original game and manga she is shown to have a bright cheerful personality that reacts very strongly to careless actions. In the anime she is depicted differently, as having a very quiet attitude. However, despite her personality before Shiki, she is a very powerful sorceress, one of the five sorceresses left in the world. (Please note that there is a large difference between sorceresses and magicians: sorceresses are capable of \"miracles\" that even magicians cannot pull off.) Her title as a sorceress is \"Miss Blue, Magic Gunner\", and is notorious in the supernatural world for her lightning-fast temper and capability to destroy, having the power to wipe out entire cities at will. Her sister Aozaki Touko appears in Kara no Kyoukai, and is the original creator of the glasses.",
