  "description" : "Bayleef is the evolution of Chikorita and first appeared in Pokémon Gold and Silver. It has a pale yellow body supported by four legs and a rather long neck and tail. On top of its head is a single large leaf. Its most defining trait is the \"necklace\" of seven tubular leaves that is located around its neck. Each of these curled up leaves contains inside it a tree shoot. From these leaves wafts a spicy scent that has stimulating properties. It can cheer people up, restore their health, make them more energetic and even heighten their drive for competition.\nBayleef is one of the Pokémon that Ash has used in its team. It evolved from Chikorita in the episode \"Current Events\". Like its pre-evolved form, Bayleef feels a strong bond of affection towards its trainer, which it usually expresses that feeling by trying to climb all over him, a matter complicated by the dramatic increase in mass. Ash used Bayleef in many battles in Johto, including gym battles and Johto League, where it battled against various opponents. Bayleef is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore left all of his Pokémon except Pikachu with Professor Oak.",
