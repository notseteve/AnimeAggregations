  "description" : "Niizuma Eiji is a 16-year-old high school student hailed as a genius by many people. He wins the Tezuka Award for his manga Large bander, after which http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro Moritaka] and http://anidb.net/ch16787 [Takagi Akito] declare him their rival. Although Mashiro and Takagi view him as a rival, he is very friendly upon meeting them and states he is a fan of theirs. He moves to Tokyo to work on the serialization of his manga Crow on the condition he is able to cancel one series in the Weekly Shounen Jump after becoming the magazine`s most popular author. The head editor has described the difference between Mashiro and Takagi to Niizuma is love of manga, indeed, Niizuma seems to have been obsessed with and drawing manga since he was 6, and makes loud sound effects with his mouth while drawing. Niizuma tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he is more humble, even claiming to not be good enough of a Mangaka to be judging other people`s work when asked by his editor to judge for the treasure magazine. He works under the direction of the Weekly Shounen Jump editor http://anidb.net/ch19973 [Hattori Yuujirou] and works with two assistants, http://anidb.net/ch19975 [Fukuda Shinta] and http://anidb.net/ch19967 [Nakai Takurou].\nSource: Wikipedia",
