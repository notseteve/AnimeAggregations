  "description" : "Named after the \"00 buck\" shotgun load, Siesta 00 wears a black uniform and has long blonde hair. She has an eyepatch over her right eye, and her left bunny-ear has a scar. As the leader of the summoned Siestas, she is very composed and serious in her work, though in general besides her work she is a nice-hearted and gentle. She is also known for going full force in battle, and lost her eye for it. She is in charge of guard and recon. Although she works under Erica for now, she shows some reluctance to do so.",
