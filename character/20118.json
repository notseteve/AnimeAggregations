  "description" : "A local police chief, Chief Muraki is a good friend of Kenshin`s and often informs him of local disturbances. During the Jinchuu arc, Uramura`s residence is attacked along with the Maekawa dojo and the Akabeko as part of Yukishiro Enishi`s plan to strike at the places in Tokyo most important to Kenshin; fortunately Uramura and his family are saved by Kenshin. As a favour to Kenshin, he deliberately points the police in the wrong direction when they attempt to arrest Sanosuke toward the end of the manga. He was not given a name until the Jinchuu arc in the manga.",
