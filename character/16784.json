  "description" : "Azuki Miho is http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro]`s former classmate and fianc√©e. She aspires to become a voice actress and shows promise in the field. She promises to marry Mashiro after they achieve their dreams. However, they must not see each other until then. Since this promise, Azuki has picked up a voicing role, and is gaining growing popularity, not because of her skills, but for her looks. At one point Azuki`s agent urged her to bring out a photo book, in effect becoming a gravure idol. With Mashiro`s support, however, she turned down the offer and persevered in her voice acting. Her mother is the woman Mashiro`s uncle fell in love with. She and Mashiro often communicate through text and sometimes through phone calls, but rarely meet.\nSource: Wikipedia",
