  "description" : "Ling Yao is a Xingese character exclusive to the Manga and the 2nd Anime. He first appears in Chapter 32, in Rush Valley. He is the twelfth prince of the eastern nation of Xing. He is the essence of \"Noblesse Oblige\" - \"privilege entails to responsibility\". Though naughty, arrogant and ambitious, he cares deeply for his servants and people - a feeling that is returned, especially from his bodyguard, http://anidb.net/ch10406 [Lan Fan]. Those outside his responsibilities are often less fortunate - as http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Ed] learns from his habit of running up room service bills. His goal in life is to become immortal and become the emperor of his country of origin. He enjoys flirting with http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry] and becomes a close friend of Ed.",
