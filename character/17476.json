  "description" : "Akimichi Chouza is the father of http://anidb.net/ch8617 [Akimichi Chouji] and former teammate of Nara Shikaku and http://anidb.net/ch10962 [Yamanaka Inoichi]. Together they were the previous Ino-Shika-Cho trio. The kanji on his chest armor means \"food\".\nChouza is the head of the Akimichi clan, and was part of the first \"Ino-Shika-Cho Trio\" alongside Nara Shikaku and Yamanaka Inoichi, his name being the Cho part of the group name. He is a seemingly gentle and caring man with great wisdom and understanding of the world, and has deep love for his son, Chouji. Like the rest of his clan, he has a large appetite, and is prone to eat everything on an entire page on the menu.\nHe seems very keen to fight with his teammates, and shares a very strong friendship.",
