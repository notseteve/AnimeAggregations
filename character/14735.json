  "description" : "Fujiwara Hazuki is a friend of Doremi since kindergarten, is a shy, passive and sweet girl. Hazuki cares about her family very much, especially her mother; she did not really like the dresses she got from her mother, but would do everything that she was asked to do. Hazuki has a large fear of ghosts and tries to counter it with thoughts of Majo Rika; this seldom works. In the end, she chose a specially reputated secondary school rather than staying with Doremi. Her fairy is Rere.",
