  "description" : "The Raider Gundam is one of three new Earth Alliance prototypes deployed in the invasion of the Orb Union. Based on an X300-series frame similar to that of the Aegis Gundam, this machine transforms into a birdlike mobile armour for high-speed flight, and in this form it can also carry another mobile suit on its back. Because the Raider is designed for close combat, its armament consists mainly of short-range beam cannons and machine guns, as well as a mace-like spherical breaker. This mobile suit is assigned to the biological CPU Clotho Buer.",
