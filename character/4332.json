  "description" : "Ootani`s next door neighbour. She is in love with Ootani, and brings him milk every day so he could reach her height, about the same as Risa`s. Since Ootani does not not have feelings toward her but does have feelings for Risa (who is exactly the same height as Mimi), she becomes jealous of her. She acts accordingly two-faced between them both: acting sweet towards Ootani, yet acting sour to Risa behind his back.",
