  "description" : "Chihiro is Hikaru`s childhood friend and has had romantic feelings for him since they were little, although she knows he is in love with Sayaka. She is mature compared to the rest of her classmates and is also strong-willed; in addition, she is popular for her beauty. Chihiro is the manager of the basketball team, but her interest in the sport dates to before that â€” she used to play basketball and wanted to become a professional until she was injured during a competition that prevented her from pursuing her dream.\nAlthough Chihiro loves Hikaru, she begins to develop feelings for Shinobu as well. She was originally going to attend Kaijou High School with Shinobu, but after observing Hikaru`s pent-up suffering without Sayaka, she decided to stay with him instead. To this day, she continues to blame herself for hurting Shinobu deeply. When Sayaka re-enters their lives, Chihiro gives up on her love with Hikaru after he rejects her confession.",
