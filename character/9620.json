  "description" : "She was a student of genetic engineering at Kyoto University, where she met Fuyutsuki, who took an interest in her research and would later become a mentor and trusted friend, as well as her future husband Gendo. Afterwards, she joined the Artificial Evolution Laboratory (which would become Gehirn) in Hakone, Japan, and played an integral role in Project E.\nDespite Fuyutsuki`s misgivings, Yui served as the test subject for the Contact Experiment of Unit 01 in 2004, saying that \"everything happens as it must.\" She invited her son Shinji to Gehirn to watch what would be her final moments: Yui \"disappeared\" during testing — leaving no body behind — and was proclaimed dead that same year after efforts to recover her failed. Although Gehirn considered it an accident, it is arguably clear that what happened was Yui`s intention. Living on as the soul of the Eva, she continues to ensure a \"bright future\" for Shinji and the rest of humanity, seeing to it personally that Seele`s scenario is never entirely fulfilled.",
