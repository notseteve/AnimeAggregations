  "description" : "Saber Alter is what becomes of http://anidb.net/ch38 [Saber] after being consumed by evil. This version of Saber appears in the Heaven`s Feel route of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel.\nSaber becomes Saber Alter after being consumed and regurgitated by http://anidb.net/ch39799 [Dark Sakura]. In that situation, Saber has a much stronger offensive ability when compared to how she was as http://anidb.net/ch1904 [Emiya Shirou]`s servant, but the evil in her decreases other abilities, like her magical resistance. She doesn`t lose her mind, but her personality is twisted, and her inherent character alignment changes from Lawful Good to Lawful Evil. Her ties with her original objectives and the people she cared for are severed, and her choices spin around Dark Sakura`s goals instead.",
