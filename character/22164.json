  "description" : "The Duel Gundam is one of four prototype Earth Alliance mobile suits captured by ZAFT. The Duel is the earliest and the most orthodox of the GAT-X units, and this general-purpose machine served as a development base for the more specialized Buster and Strike. The Duel is armed with a beam rifle and two beam sabers, and it carries a shield similar to that of the Strike, with an anti-beam coating that protects the mobile suit from energy weapons. After its capture, this machine is assigned to ZAFT pilot Yzak Joule.",
