  "description" : "After the successful design of the first destroids, the U.N. Government began exploring various concepts in destroid technology to build main battle robots (MBRs) suited to different operational roles. One such concept was to create an anti-aircraft destroid that could mount powerful, super-far-range weaponry for firing in space. A joint development program by Viggers-Chrauler was authorized by the U.N. Government and resulted in the eventual deployment of the Mk X Defender Destroid. Utilizing the standard destroid ambulatory system, the Defender featured a new upper chassis with two, double barrel Erlikon Contraves II weapons systems firing 78mm rounds. These impressive wide-bore guns fired 500 rounds per minute from each of the four barrels and had a muzzle velocity of 3,300 meters per second. Two large ammunition drums mounted on top of the chassis fed through the weapons bays for fast firing and designs were eventually made for enlarged magazines featuring a much greater ammunition capacity.\nThe Mk X Defender Destroid proved successful and was approved for mass production. Unfortunately the weapons systems were prohibitively expensive and notoriously difficult to manufacture, resulting in a lengthy lead-time to deployment. The first Defender units saw action shortly after the beginning of Space War I but only in limited numbers. Forty units were manufactured aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and served throughout the war along side other destroid units. Though the Defender was a capable mecha, as a defensive unit in constant front line engagements, these destroids suffered heavy losses during the war.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/destroid-defender.htm",
