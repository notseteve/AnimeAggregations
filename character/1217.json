  "description" : "Chingling is a small, yellow bell-like Pokémon. Chingling moves by lightly bouncing around. It makes a ringing sound every time it bounces. The ringing sound isn`t always a delightful chime-it can deafen an opponent with the high-frequency rings. The creature appears in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl at Mt. Coronet. It is the pre-evolution of Chimecho of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald.",
