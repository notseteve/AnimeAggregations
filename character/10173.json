  "description" : "Sig is the large, doting husband of http://anidb.net/ch10172 [Izumi Curtis]. Together with his wife, he runs a Meat shop in Dublith and housed http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric during their alchemy apprenticeship, though he himself is not an alchemist. Despite his perpetually angry-looking face, Sig is quite a nice person and laments the repellent nature of his visage. He is very devoted to and protective of Izumi, constantly worrying about her bad health and often needlessly rushing to her rescue when he senses danger (as he did when she was approached by Ulchi at Devil`s Nest and when she was \"stabbed\" by Van Hohenheim ) and becoming jealous when Izumi speaks fondly of other men. He has also been shown to be able to sleep with his eyes wide open. Sig has mentioned that he blames himself for not realizing sooner that Izumi had been experimenting with Human Transmutation.",
