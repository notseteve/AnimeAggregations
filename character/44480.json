  "description" : "During the early events of Char`s Counterattack, the Noa family is seen attempting to leave Earth and rejoin Bright from a spaceport in the path of Char`s first asteroid drop (although they are unaware of the drop). Mirai sends Hathaway to space by himself, sacrificing her seat on the shuttle. She tells her son that she and Cheimin will follow on the next flight, but they are unable to leave Hong Kong and at the end of the movie they watch the bright lights after Amuro had destroyed the Axis Asteroid.\nSource: Wiki",
