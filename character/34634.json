  "description" : "Rikuo`s father and the second head of the Nura group. The son of Nurarihyon and Yohime, he is a hanyou (half youkai) and the Nura group`s power reached its peak under his leadership. Mostly because of his wife, Yamabuki Otome encouraging him. He didn`t want Rikuo to know about the yakuza aspect of the youkai world, and raised the boy in such a way as to prevent him from learning of it. He was killed by Hagoromo Gitsune when Rikuo was young.\nIt was later revealed that before he married his current wife, Rihan fell in love with and wedded Yamabuki Otome, a beautiful ayakashi. However, due to Hagoromo-Gitsune`s curse on Nurarihyon (that his youkai bloodline would die out), they couldn`t have children. Blaming it on herself, Yamabuki Otome eventually left Rihan a poem grieving her infertility and disappeared, presumably dead. In a scheme to get rid of Rihan to revive Hagoromo-Gitsune, Abe no Seimei and Sanmoto Gorouzaemon revived Yamabuki Otome as a child or her younger self and Hagoromo-Gitsune, who possessed her body and fabricated her memories. As her form resembled his late first wife, Rihan got close to her. It was only then when Rihan turned his back from Hagoromo-Gitsune that she recited Yamabuki Otome`s farewell poem (The `key` to his death) and slashed him from behind, killing Rihan with young Rikuo witnessing his father`s death.\nSource: wiki",
