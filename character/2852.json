  "description" : "Relena is the pampered daughter of the Earth Alliance`s vice minister for foreign affairs. Her father is responsible for the negotiations with the space colonists, an assignment which leaves Mr. Darlian little time for his wife and child. Her family`s wealth and status make Relena the star of her private school`s social scene, but do little to reduce her boredom and loneliness. When her quiet existence is disrupted by the Gundam pilots, this poor little rich girl discovers her own, previously untapped, reserves of strength and courage.",
