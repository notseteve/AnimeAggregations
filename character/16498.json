  "description" : "Garfiel is a skilled automail engineer and the proprietor of Atelier Garfiel in the town of Rush Valley. When http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell] is referred to him by http://anidb.net/ch16497 [Dominic], Garfiel is only too happy to accept the cute young girl as his live-in apprentice and joins the rest of the Rush Valley community in treating her like a beloved family member. Garfiel is rather effeminate and appears to prefer the company of men, which results in his acting largely as a source of comic relief in scenes that involve him.",
