  "description" : "Also known as the Master of the Sky in the anime, he is the sadistic and ruthless leader of Synapse. He finds enjoyment in torturing the Angeloids he owns (both physically and emotionally), seeing them as merely his playthings to which he can do with as he pleases, and discarding them while considering them nothing more than trash. He is condescending towards humans, referring to them as \"Downers\", a trait that would be later shared with Nymph. Though because of his arrogant ways and believing that the Angeloids that serve him will obey his every order, he always reacts surprised when he witnesses one of them break their chain or go against his orders. He is often seen on his throne with two Angeloids beside him, and like Daedalus, his face is obscured in all of his appearances.",
