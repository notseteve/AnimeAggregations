  "description" : "Bart Garsus is a first-class citizen from Taraak, coming from rich parents who owned a food production company. He is initially an easily excitable, weak, and cowardly character, and ends up becoming the helmsman of the Nirvana when the ship chose him for the job. He usually liked to run away from any difficulty presented to him and made a fuss every time he was injured.\nEarly in Vandread: The Second Stage, Bart showed compassion for a sick little girl on a polluted planet. She listened to his embellished stories and laughed at his jokes. When a Harvest ship threatened the planet, he showed courage and resolve on another`s behalf for the first time by fighting the ships off almost single handedly with the transformed weapons of the Nirvana. But while he was gone, she passed away from her illness. She left a doll of Bart she was making, without finishing the hair. In her memory, Bart shaved his head, closely bringing his appearance to that of the unfinished doll and hung it around his neck like a pendant.\nTowards the end of the series, he develops feelings for BC, not knowing her secret, but even after he finds out, he is not swayed, and continues to pursue BC for a relationship[citation needed]. While more settled late in the series, Bart remains a comic relief character.\nBart appears for a brief moment in the manga, but does not join the Nirvana.",
