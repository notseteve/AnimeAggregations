  "description" : "Sanson is the brawn side of the team and serves as the Gratan`s navigation pilot. Depite his slight yet muscular build, his strength overcomes even the most powerful of mecha. When he was younger he was slimmer and girls made fun of him; as he trained day by day he became stronger but incredibly vain. Sanson also is an outstanding marksman. He was the chauffeur to Granva`s family before they lost their fortune, and he remains faithful to her until the end of the series. In the epilogue, he has married a grown-up Marie and they are expecting their first child.",
