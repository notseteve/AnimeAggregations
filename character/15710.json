  "description" : "An ancient vampire who resides in the Castle of Chaythe, where Meier and Charlotte go hoping that a still-functional ship can take them away from Earth. Many years earlier, Carmilla`s bloodlust had become so rampant that D`s father, the Lord of Vampires, impaled her in her sleep, leaving her body to rot and her spirit imprisoned within her haunted castle. Carmilla turns out to be the true villain of the film: her invitation to Meier Link and Charlotte is a ruse, and her true intention is to sacrifice Charlotte and steal her body. Her plan is foiled, and she is killed once and for all by D with aid from Link.",
