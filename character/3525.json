  "description" : "Kanna is a young girl also known as Kannabi no Mikoto, since `-bi no mikoto` is the formal suffix given to all winged beings. She is one of the last winged beings in history. Kanna was deified out of fear for the awesome power inherent in all of her kind, so from birth, Kanna had been kept in isolated areas away from the general populace. Not long after meeting Ryuuya and Uraha, she escaped with them in order to find her mother, the only other winged being left. While not knowing much about the outside world, Kanna adamantly took up learning how to juggle in the hope that she would one day be able to show her mother upon their reunion.",
