  "description" : "Pump`s Pumpkaboo is the prince of a castle in the Kalos region. The prince had fallen in love at first sight with Jessie`s Pumpkaboo and Pump ordered his butler to invite them to the castle to be introduced and to have a meal. Upon meeting them, Pump noticed that Jessie`s Pumpkaboo was a truly excellent Bakeccha and that he`d never seen such a big one before. Pump`s Pumpkaboo though was a lot smaller than Jessie`s Pumpkaboo.\nPump then asked Jessie to trade her Bakeccha so that the prince could wed her. Despite initial hesitation, Jessie agreed and traded her Bakeccha. During the trade process, Jessie`s Pumpkaboo evolved into Jessie`s Gourgeist. Pump then realized that Pumpjin is a trade evolution and the prince liked the way Bakeccha looked better and no longer wished to get married.",
