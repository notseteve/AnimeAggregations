  "description" : "The leader of the black knights and determined to crush the \"fragments\". In actual, he is one of the 14 saints from Index, called \"George of the Rainbow\". He was sent out with his subordinates to eliminate Index top priority threat, Liselotte Wreckmeister. After a seemingly losing battle with Liselotte at Ayame`s Hill 70 years ago, he used his last resort, the forbidden technique, Contract of the Rainbow to split Liselotte`s soul and the piece of Emerald Tablet within her into seven fragments to weaken her. Liselotte with one of the fragments remains in her body was sealed within the crystal. The other fragments, due to the technique, was scattered across 6 parallel worlds. This explain why he calls the gang \"fragments\" because their bodies contain those \"fragments\" and those \"fragments\" are the sources of their powers. In his past mission, he sealed a dragon within his body with the same technique and release it in the final battle to crush the \"fragments\" and Liselotte with the price of losing himself. It took a lot out of him to maintain seal of the dragon within his body and at the same time Liselotte`s seal.",
