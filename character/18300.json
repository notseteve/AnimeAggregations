  "description" : "The absolute antagonistic plot device of FF:U, Omega is a mysterious being who can destroy everything around it simply by being nearby, though whether it is truly malevolent or not is unknown. Prior to the series, Omega`s body is scattered into many pieces across Wonderland in the form of living, but dormant crystals. However, when a piece of Omega is active, it is intent to find its \"siblings\" and fuse with them to recreate Omega, attacking anything that would interfere. Due to Omega`s power, its pieces are targeted by the series` antagonists as part of the Earl`s plan.",
