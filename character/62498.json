  "description" : "Nurse Joy in the Kalos region looks a little different than she does in the other regions in the Pokémon World. Her duties are to take care of injured Pokémon as they arrive at the Pokémon Center. She is a trained nurse and with the help of her Wigglytuff she is able to nurse the Pokémon back to health. Like the other regions in the Pokémon World, the Nurse Joy of the Kalos region have many sisters. The only real way to differentiate between them when next to each other is to look at the color of the badge on their outfits.",
