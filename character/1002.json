  "description" : "Altaria carries a highly refined set of vocal cords for a Pok√©mon. It sings and trills beautiful melodies (which has been described as a gorgeous soprano) in its crystal-clear voice as its pastime in the mountains, making its listeners experience dreamy wonderment. Altaria also carries a flame sac within its body, which it uses to launches intensely hot fireballs from its mouth in self defense from attackers. During migration, Altaria wheels through the sky among billowing, cotton-like clouds, supported by aerial updrafts in the sky that it catches with its buoyant wings in order to soar.",
