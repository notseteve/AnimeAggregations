  "description" : "He is Yura`s older brother and follows the belief that the world is black and white, with youkai being absolute black, whereas he and the rest of the Onmyouji are white, causing him to have no hesitation in striking down one. He is a trickster and a liar, he constantly teases and berates Yura and attacks Rikuo to make him turn into his \"Night\" form. He only left his first battle with Rikuo out of respect for the latter`s human blood, saying he doesn`t accept \"grey\" existences. He later returns to fight Akifusa. He`s revealed to have been a potential candidate for the leadership of the household and is injured in his fight with Akifusa and rescued by Mamiru.",
