  "description" : "Meeting the need for a powered battle suit in the male division of the Zentradi Army, the Nousjadeul-Ger is a functional if unremarkable mecha. The battle suit is operated by a single pilot and possesses a small armament with just enough weapons diversity to match most foes. The Nousjadeul-Ger`s primary weapon is a large plasma cannon mounted across the back engine mount, capable of being swiveled forward and ready to fire very quickly. In short range battle, the suit is equipped with a torso mounted impact cannon and can carry a variety of small arms in either (or both) of the hands.\nThe strength of the Nousjadeul-Ger lies in its versatility for all-environment deployment and suitability for most combat operations. When on a planet, the Nousjadeul-Ger is not limited to surface operations like the http://anidb.net/ch48811 [Regult] nor is it strictly an air unit like the http://anidb.net/ch48795 [Gnerl]. The battle suit can engage in long-range flight within the atmosphere and can use this capability to broaden its combat effectiveness using its limited array of weaponry. The suit is also an excellent close-quarters, large-scale combat unit, capable of swift hand-to-hand fighting and possessing enough physical strength to cripple the most heavily armored enemy mecha. Lacking superior firepower and designed without preference for any single combat situation, the Nousjadeul-Ger is nonetheless a practical mecha capable of competent performance in most operations.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/nousjadeul-ger.htm",
