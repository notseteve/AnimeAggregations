  "description" : "Woodrow completes ordinance surveys on a forest outside of New Bark Town where many Pinsir, Heracross and Butterfree live.\nJessie, James and Meowth disturbed the Pinsir`s territory by stealing all of their sap from the trees. The Pinsir vacated their own territory and took over the more passive Heracross`s territory easily as they are the more agreesive Pok√©mon.\nWith the help of Ash, Misty and Brock they drove Team Rocket out of the forest and the Pinsir quickly returned to their original home and the Heracross reclaimed their own territory. After waving goodbye to Ash and friends, Woodrow remained in the forest to continue his surveys",
