  "description" : "Haja is the de facto leader of the Oracion Six and one of its most powerful members (second only to Berial, according to the author). He is one of the top mages in the world, second only perhaps to his master Shakuma (the world`s greatest mage). His overwhelming might is primarily attributed to his ability to generate limitless quantities of mana, which gained him the title of \"Haja the Infinite\"; while this was seemingly a natural ability at first, it was later revealed to be derived from a Dark Bring implanted within him. Like the archmage Sieghart, he hails from the town of Mildea, the city of time. He was initially depicted as being one of Demon Card`s most loyal members, but later events would later reveal him to be a highly devious and ambitious individual, who plotted to have the most powerful forces for both good AND evil eliminated and coveted ultimate power to achieve control over the entire world and all of time. To that end, he returned to his hometown of Mildea to acquire the great power that dwelled beneath it, but was opposed and inevitably killed by Sieg, who was aided by the Mildeans. It was revealed afterwards that Haja carried within him the essence of the Demon Card scientist Igor Kilkila, who was released after Haja was killed (Igor was subsequently defeated and imprisoned by Sieg and the Mildeans).",
