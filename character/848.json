  "description" : "Tyranitar is the final evolution of Larvitar. Its strength is insurmountable and its body is nearly impenetrable. It can easily change the landscape with its strength, often causing maps to have to be redrawn if it rampages. It can destroy a whole mountain with one arm, just to make its nest. It has an insolent nature towards all other beings, and due to its own the toughness of its body, it seeks out opponents constantly.",
