  "description" : "Skull is the holder of the Purple pacifier of the Cloud. Head of the combat forces of the Calcassa Family, Skull wears a full leather outfit and a motorcycle helmet, which is copied by all his subordinates. His pet is a giant armoured octopus whose tentacles follow his hand and finger movements. He is implied to be not as powerful of an infant as Reborn and Colonnello, whom he calls his senpais, and is looked down upon and ridiculed by the two. Reborn considers Skull as always being someone`s errand boy and Skull, to his dismay, does not deny the fact that the only person he was an errand boy to was Reborn.\nSource: wiki",
