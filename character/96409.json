  "description" : "The 1st Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet. In 798 UC it was stationed at the planet Heinessen as the Alliance capital`s sole defensive fleet.\nAs no actual separate fleets existed - or were needed - prior to the Battle of Dagon - it is certain that it was the first independent force established by the Alliance as it strengthened and expanded its forces to keep the Imperial forces from taking over its territory. It presumably was started from one of the six squadrons which http://anidb.net/ch1030 [Lin Pao] led to victory in the aforementioned battle. In any event, it was formed before the Second Battle of Tiamat.\nOver the 150 years of the war, the 1st Fleet was, aside from its role as a line of defense for planet Heinessen itself, the main internal military arm to prevent piracy and other space-based crimes. Because of this, the 1st Fleet enjoyed more support than most from the Alliance populace.\nAlthough it had, throughout the war, fought in few actual battles, three years of severe attrition had whittled down the Free Planets Star Fleet to only two main, full-strength fleets by 799 UC: the 1st Fleet under Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch740 [Paetta], and the Yang Fleet. With the latter fleet charged with protecting the Alliance from the Iserlohn front, it was the 1st Fleet, as well as the newly-formed 14th and 15th, which formed the core of the 39,600 Alliance ships which fought at the Battle of Rantemario.\nFollowing the battle, what battle-ready ships remained were transferred under the command of http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] during his guerilla-like counterattack, and the 1st Fleet, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist with the Treaty of Baâ€˜alat.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
