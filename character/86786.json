  "description" : "Pheromosa is a dual-type Bug/Fighting Pokémon.\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nIt is one of the Ultra Beasts and is known by the code name UB-02 Beauty.\nPheromosa is an Ultra Beast mostly resembling an anthropomorphic, feminine cockroach. It has a thin build and is mostly white. It has a segmented body, having 5 segments dividing its torso. Pheromosa has a long and narrow neck, and a small semicircular face. It has narrow white eyes with a purple iris, and blue pupils. Pheromosa has long, thin legs suited for running and kicking, with golden pads at the joints. Its feet consist of two twig-like structures, rather resembling high-heeled shoes.\nPheromosa`s lithe, elegant body is capable of sudden feats of acceleration, able to twitch its limbs at an estimated 120 mph (200 km/h) instantaneously, a speed previously unseen in the world. It also produces a sort of disarming pheromone which was described as \"previously unknown to science\" that causes those nearby to become awestruck by its presence. It displays a considerable reluctance towards touching anything, as if it interprets the Pokémon world as being unclean somehow.",
