  "description" : "The daughter of the previous king of Magical Land, Elise seeks to exact revenge against Punie for stealing her place as the next-in-line for the throne after Punie`s mother Esmeralda`s coup. She digs large diameter holes in the ground as traps, resulting in a nickname of \"Hole Digger Elise\" from Punie to her displeasure. She makes a direct challenge to Punie. Despite Elise`s apparent advantage against Punie in unarmed combat in the early stages of their face-off, she eventually succumbs and is subsequently tortured with as many as 7 different kinds of submission holds and locks off-camera before Tetsuko and Anego. After the initial encounter, Elise becomes Punie`s classmate, and sits behind Tesuko.",
