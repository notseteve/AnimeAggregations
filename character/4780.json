  "description" : "A princess of Roshtaria and Fatora`s older sister; she is both the leader of Roshtaria and the head of the Alliance. A serious, intelligent and kind-hearted ruler, she sends Makoto and Fujisawa on a mission to locate the Muldoon priestesses so that they can unseal the Eye of God. Even though Fatora`s absence renders the superweapon useless, she and the other Alliance members believe that such an action would deter the Bugrom from attacking. She`s also engaged to Prince Galus, who supports the action.",
