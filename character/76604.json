  "description" : "The Queen of the Proto-City Spear Shelled Glendan. Despite being a queen, she is also one of the 12 Heaven`s Blade successors. She is vastly stronger than any of the individual Heaven`s Blade Receivers, and only if they all were to band together, would their power surpass hers. It is implied that her strength may be the result of possessing a Haikizoku. Bored of her life as Queen Alsheyra, she left the castle to live a different kind life under the disguise of a senior laboratory student, Synola Leiser. The Heaven`s Blade Receiver Kanaris Earifon Rivin was forced to cover for her, due to the latter`s ability to impersonate others. She met Leerin in a meadow one day, and they have been friends since. She has a habit of rating other people`s breasts, particularly fond of those from Leerin.\nSource: en.wiki",
