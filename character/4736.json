  "description" : "The heavy-smoking thirty-six-year-old supervisor of Umegae Naomi. He has become extremely attached to his esper charge over the four years since her supernatural powers were discovered when she was twelve-years-old. While he has done a good job of administrating the development of Naomi`s social character which has allowed the use of her telekinesis for constructive ends, Ichirou has also demonstrated signs of a lecherous personal agenda to refine Naomi into his \"ideal woman\". Despite having twice been on the receiving end of Naomi`s telekinesis misfiring and her telekinetic exhortations to keep a professional distance, Ichirou has not been convinced to abandon his lecherous personal agenda and has a developed a masochistic facet to his obsessions.",
