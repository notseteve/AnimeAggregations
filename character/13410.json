  "description" : "Captain Buccaneer is an Amestrian State Military Officer stationed at Fort Briggs and a close subordinate of Major General http://anidb.net/ch13409 [Olivier Mira Armstrong]. Abrasive and suspicious, Buccaneer is often one to strike first and ask questions later, in fitting with the Briggs mindset of \"Survival of the Fittest\", and seems to enjoy violence and combat, often using vicious animal metaphors in his speech. He is loath to trust strangers and does not hold back in dealing out harsh treatment to people with whom he is unfamiliar. Despite this, Buccaneer is an incredibly brave and loyal soldier and shows his more jovial side to those whom he calls \"comrade\".",
