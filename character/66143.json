  "description" : "Verberia or Swamp Witch is a mysterious and powerful witch who was never seen in the story, yet her influence is felt throughout the land. She is the master of Airi and Melona, and is responsible for Menace`s resurrection.\nIn Queen`s Blade Rebellion, the Swamp Witch`s ambitions to eventually rule the Continent went a step further. She had resurrected and empowered the long-dead pirate Liliana to lead an army of undead. She was also responsible for the genocide of the elves and for inflicting magical curses on Alleyne (restricting her movements to within her forest), Risty (making her unable to eat or sleep during a \"Beautiful Fighter Hunt\") and Tomoe (leaving her blind). It was also revealed that the Swamp Witch owned a gladiatorial arena where slaves and monsters fought each other.\nSource: Wiki",
