  "description" : "The smallest of the UN Spacy ships of the line, the Northampton Class Stealth Frigate is an easily constructed vessel and functions as the main-force warship for colonization fleets. The main engines are built around the center circumference of the rear hull and supply the 250-meter long frigate with excellent speed and maneuverability that compensates for a lack of heavy firepower. Like many of the next generation space vessels of the UNG, the stealth frigate features a stealth composition and functions as a carrier ship for variable fighters. In battle the stealth frigate utilizes several concealed launch bays for the fighters and has several anti-ship missile launchers and converging energy beam cannons. The widespread use of this class has lead to the deployment of numerous modified Bolognese frigates such as firepower-enhanced, reconnaissance and early-warning variants. The stealth frigates have also been adopted by Zentradi crews and these ships feature more Zentradi technology with distinctive hull designs. The stealth frigate fulfill a primary operational role and thus there are large numbers of these ships serving in the UN Spacy fleets, from planetary defense around Earth to far reaching colony fleets like the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. Stealth Frigates serve as the first defensive line in the emigration fleets, with aircraft carriers forming the second defense line. Additionally, a squadron of stealth frigates will operate as \"pilot fish\" for surveying routes and securing supplies ahead of a emigration fleet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/stealthfrigate.htm",
