  "description" : "Yanma physically resembles a dragonfly. It has a large green head on a long red thorax, six legs and two pairs of wings. Its head has a pair of segmented eyes and two red spikes on top. Yanma has extremely well-developed wing muscles; in fact, they can generate enough force to break glass by means of the resulting shockwave. Frightened Yanma have been recorded as breaking the sound barrier. Yanma is aided when hunting by its prodigious flying ability; it navigates so perfectly that it can abruptly change direction in mid-flight without slowing down. It can evolve into a Yanmega.",
