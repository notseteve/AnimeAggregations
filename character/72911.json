Unfortunately it was just doing a rehearsal and Carl`s Snubbull got mad and bit Ash Ketchum on the arm after it realized that Ellade got injured. Nurse Joy (Kalos) bandaged up its leg and told it would take a few days to heal so it couldn`t perform during that time.\nNone of its moves were confirmed in the episode.",
