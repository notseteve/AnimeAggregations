  "description" : "Cheese is the chao that`s always with Cream. The bowtie distinguishes this chao from other chao. She cannot talk, but she can just about melt any heart. Cheese is not Cream`s pet, but rather a close friend.\nIn the US version of the episode where Cheese gets lost, Chris refers to Cheese as \"she\" when he says \"she must be so scared\", which indicates that Cheese is female. In the Japanese version, Cheese is called a \"he\" in episode 16, but is then also referred to as a female in episode 22, thus indicating that Cheese is genderless, just like all Chao. In the videogames, however, Cheese is apparently male.",
