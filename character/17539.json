  "description" : "The Individual Eleven is a fictional terrorist group that http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Public Security Section 9] dealt with inhttp://anidb.net/a1176 [ Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG].\nThe Individual Eleven`s motive for terror is an essay also entitled \"The Individual Eleven\", which is, in reality, a fake essay implanted with a computer virus that infects all who read it. It even infected http://anidb.net/ch16591 [Borma] of Section 9, although he showed no further signs of symptoms as a result. The virus remains dormant up until the user downloads all of the other ten essays by Patrick Sylvestre (a fictional political theorist), when it programs the person infected by it to commit suicide. However, it seems the virus itself does not cause the members of the Individual Eleven to commit the acts of terror, it is their own political views which cause them to do so. The virus only seems to be there to make them, perhaps, unwilling martyrs, as all the members of the primary Individual Eleven (except http://anidb.net/ch10194 [Kuze]) kill each other with swords in a televised mass suicide. Although these eleven were apparently the primary members, it is likely that other people, such as the refugees that committed suicide bombings, could be considered as a part of the Individual Eleven because they were also infected with the virus.\nThe eleventh essay supposedly refers to the events surrounding the May 15th Incident, which was one of several incidents that led to the rise of Japanese militarism.\nIt should be noted that the virus only affects those who possess cyberbrains, and, in addition, it is suggested by http://anidb.net/ch17488 [Gouda Kazundo] that the virus affects only those individuals who were virgins prior to undergoing full cyberization.",
