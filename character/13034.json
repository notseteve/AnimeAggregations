  "description" : "Tamami is close friends and classmates with Aoba Kozue. She always has a camera and takes pictures of embarrassing situations and Kozue. She is also an inactive member (\"Ghost member\") of the occult club, along with Kozue. She is very strong physically (usually K.O street punks in one hit), although she appears quite normal, if not short and weak. A perpetually smiling evil genius, Tamami is cold, sarcastic, cruel, manipulative, inconsiderate and condescending towards those she deem to be her moral/intellectual inferiors; which in other words mean everybody besides Kozue-Chan (and her other personalities). This is explained by her usually being isolated for her extreme geniuses before meeting Kozue. Of course, Tamami also goes to Seika Tandai Fuzoku High School with Kozue, and she says \"desu\" at the end of her sentences. In the manga, it is revealed that she is actually a very emotional person, crying all the while during Momono`s departure. (Whether she and Momono is especially close or she just loves everyone in Narutakisou is unknown). Her birthday is November 8 and at the start of the manga and anime, her age is the same as Kozue`s.\nSource: Wikipedia",
