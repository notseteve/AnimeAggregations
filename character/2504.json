  "description" : "Rokujo`s and Kouichi`s 25-year-old teacher in the \"front world\". Born in Ireland on March 17, Kumohira is actually a ninja of the Banten village in the world of Nabari. He is entirely devoted to protecting Rokujo, and wants him to become the ruler of Nabari. He has an intense hatred of transport, such as trains and buses, and would not get on one until Miharu manages to \"persuade\" him. He went to Japan because his grandfather was a \"Japan otaku\" and \"ninja fanatic\", who forced him to go to learn to become a ninja, and was unable to return home for ten years (partly due to his phobia of vehicles). It was during this time that he became the Rokujo family`s close acquaintance, the memories about which Miharu has lost after an incident concerning the Shinrabanshou and its user (who was Miharu`s mother, Asahi Rokujo) killed his parents and Kumohira`s grandfather and erased the concerned individuals` memories about it, except Kumohira`s himself, 10 years ago.",
