She is very energetic, loves fantasy and has a big imagination. Miko had always wanted to have a baby girl, so when Yuuri was young she let his hair grow long and dressed him in girls` clothes. Through the series little is learned about her, but she is known to be an excellent fencer, always ready and willing to defend her family.\nMiko often gives strange advice to Yuuri, and in some situations it really helps Yuuri out. She likes to be called \"Mama\" instead of \"Mom\" or \"Mother\" by her sons, and \"Jennifer\" by other people. The only ones who actually call her \"Mama\" are not her sons, but Murata and Wolfram.\nHer specialty is curry, which she says can unite the world in peace.",
