  "description" : "Not much is revealed about Kyon`s fifth-grade sister; not even her real name is given. Other characters simply refer to the ten-year-old as Kyon`s (Younger) Sister or Little Sis.\nShe is carefree, happy and playful and is also the force behind the use of the nickname \"Kyon\"; after she heard their aunt call her older brother such, she started using the nickname as well in front of his school friends. From there, the name spread and eventually stuck. She seems to get along well with all of the SOS Brigade, especially with Mikuru and Tsuruya, sharing a sister-like relationship with them.",
