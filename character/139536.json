  "description" : "A member of the Nine Soldiers in the movie \"A Tale of Perishing.\" From the Kingdom of Beasts. The Guardian Beast of the Legendary Hero Luke. Born on the same day as Luke, he was destined to protect Luke, the hero, from that moment on. He`s willing to do anything to protect Luke. Luke is his partner and his best friend. Loves women. He immediately flirts with any cute girl he sees. He believes himself to be quite the charmer, though in reality, he`s not very successful. Bright and optimistic in nature. Quite the chatterbox. If you share a secret with Unio, it`s likely the whole town will know by the next day.\nSource: Official X",
