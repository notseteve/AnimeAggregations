  "description" : "Suguru is hired as Bad Luck`s keyboard player. Though he usually fakes being polite to others, young Suguru is quite similar to his cousin, Tohma Seguchi, despite his unfortunate proclivity for being controlled by others. While only sixteen years old, he has incredible talent - and knows it. Suguru knows Eiri Yuki`s past as well, but it seems that Yuki also knows a bit about Suguru himself: he has commented before about Suguru \"hiding his real identity\". He is quite short for his age, something K and Tatsuha constantly tease him about.",
