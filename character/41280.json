  "description" : "A chain that lives in a dimension created from Alice`s memories. He resembles a human form of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. Cheshire was actually Alice`s pet cat from 100 years ago. The bell around his neck is the `truth` from 100 years ago, later taken by Break. The Cheshire cat is a unique chain in that he doesn`t need a contractor in order to leave the Abyss (since his residence isn`t in the Abyss in the first place). Originally believed to be a fervent servant of the Intention of the Abyss, it later turns out that he is trying to protect Alice`s memories that she abandoned, in order to prevent her from suffering pain when she recalls them. Break mentions that Cheshire`s eye was his.\nSource: Wikipedia",
