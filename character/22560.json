This Pokémon was worshiped by the people of Pokémopolis as a God before the city`s demise.\nMany years later, Gengar was reawakened by Jessie`s Arbok who disturbed its artifact which acted as an ancient Pokéball. Once it had awoke it started to rampage towards Pallet Town smashing through some powerlines on the way. Although Ash`s Pidgeotto and Brock`s Onix were absorbed into Gengar`s body, they had managed to divert Gengar back to the site where Gengar`s relic had been discovered.\nSuddenly, another ancient Pokémon was reawakened by an archaeologist called Eve. This Pokémon, an Alakazam, immediately battled Gengar causing distruction to the surrounding area and it wasn`t until the final ancient Pokémon Jigglypuff awoke and started singing that their fighting was calmed and they returned to their artifacts.",
