  "description" : "Yamauchi Sawa is Switch and Masafumi`s childhood friend. She has a tendency to mix up words, much like Remi, and since middle school was popular with boys. She and Switch held feelings for each other, but were ultimately unable to openly admit them until it was too late. When they were children, Switch asked her whether she would rather marry him or his brother; it is implied that she chose Switch.\nDuring her freshman year of high school, she discovered a boy was stalking her. Soon after, when she received a death threat in the mail, she went to the Usui brothers for advice. As a result of their suggestions, she decided to go buy some self-protection equipment. Switch, who had been acting strangely, opted not to go and instead she went with Masafumi. Some time after they went out, they encountered Sawa`s supposed friend Yukino - who stabbed Masafumi in the chest. As a result of a conversation with Switch, Yukino believed Masafumi was Sawa`s boyfriend and acted out of revenge for her own ex-boyfriend dumping her in favor of pursuing Sawa. Shortly after Masafumi`s death and his brother`s subsequent downward spiral, Sawa and her family moved. She couldn`t remain in the same town any longer, as it held too many memories and she kept seeing Masafumi wherever she went.\nSource: Sket Dance Wiki",
