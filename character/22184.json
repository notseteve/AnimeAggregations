  "description" : "The first combat mobile suit developed by ZAFT, and the backbone of its military forces. The fighting strength of the GINN is equivalent to that of five Earth Alliance mobile armours, and can singlehandedly destroy an Alliance escort ship. Although the GINN is classified as a Zero Gravity Maneuver Fighter, it can operate on Earth as well, and this versatile machine can be adapted to a wide range of mission roles and combat environments. Its standard armament consists of a machine gun and a blade for slicing apart enemy mobile armours, but the GINN can also be outfitted with a variety of heavy weapons and guided missiles.",
