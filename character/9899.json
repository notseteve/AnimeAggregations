  "description" : "Reki is a mother figure to the other Haibane of http://anidb.net/ch26011 [Old Home]. She has been a Haibane for seven years, longer than any of the others except for http://anidb.net/ch14484 [Nemu].\nReki cannot remember her \"cocoon dream\", and is troubled by her past at Old Home and by nightmares. She is the only known Haibane of Old Home born with stained wings, showing that she is \"sin-bound\"; she uses a dye to keep this a secret from everyone except for Nemu and http://anidb.net/ch14494 [Kuramori] (who got the dye recipe from http://anidb.net/ch14488 [Washi]).\nWhen her guardian Kuramori left Guri, Reki ran away and became a Haibane of the http://anidb.net/ch26012 [Abandoned Factory] for a while.",
