Although she reject Yosshi because she love Nobuhiro, but later she decided to married someone else because she grew tired of waiting for Nobuhiro said to her \"I love You\". She looks very young despite her ages; she also bears a strong resemblance to her oldest daughter, Miho, especially when she was younger, looking almost exactly like Miho. At first, she feared Moritaka and Miho would go down the same path at her and Mobuhiro, but has been proven wrong. After learning of Mashiro and Takagi`s plan to be successful mangakas, she encourages them to go through with their dream. Despite being kind and caring, she does have a negative trait of being too nosey about Miho and Moritaka`s love life. Miyuki is good at keeping secrets unless she feels no need to keep them, but she will give hints about the secret, such as warning Miho not to go down the same path in love as she did with Nobuhiro.\n",
