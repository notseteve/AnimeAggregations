  "description" : "Shobu is one of Iris` closest friends and she lives in the Dragon Village where she is studying breeding. Back when the two of them were little, they would often talk about what the world outside the village would be like. Shobu would prefer a life like Iris`, in which she could travel freely. She hoped that once the Dihead the was taking care of evolved into Sazandora, that the Matriarch would let her start a journey too.\nOnce Dihead had evolved into Sazandora and Iris was able to calm it down, Shobu asked the Matriarch if she could go. The matriarch had been waiting for Shobu to ask of her own accord and told her that Iris wasn`t the only special person in the village. She had hoped that Shobu would want to expand her own talents and to move forward and accomplish something of her own accord.",
