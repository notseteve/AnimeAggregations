  "description" : "The only female of the YOUKAI-NINGEN. She admires for a human being, and craves for becoming one herself.\nShe usually goes to a prestigious school \"Cent Joseph high school\" located in Upper town, hiding her true identity under the name \"Annabella\" and enjoys the school life with her classmates. For her, this is an effort to get along with human society when the time comes to her to become a human being. Because she faces the fact that YOUKAI-NINGEN is different from other human being, she does not have a strong prejudice against humans, but is often hurt by that very fact.\nShe is by nature an expressive person, but because she is usually with silent BEM and BELO, she does not talk a lot.\nShe gracefully handles a whip which is hidden in her right arm. She also has a special ability to handle a freezing air.\nSource: Official page",
