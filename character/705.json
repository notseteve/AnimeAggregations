  "description" : "Sakura is the student of Kazemi affiliated junior high class 3-3. She is Jun`ichi`s elder cousin and first love. She is a very lively girl who, much to Nemu`s dismay, shows great affection towards Jun`ichi. She is sometimes seen with Utamaru and understands what it says. While older than than Jun`ichi, she addresses him as onii-chan (meaning \"older-brother\"), hoping that Jun`ichi would act like an elder brother to protect her. While sporting a great love for Japanese culture, she appears to be more of the mistaken foreigner. She has an IQ of 180, but she`s inept with kanji due to growing up in America. She inherited her grandmother`s magical ability. Despite the passing of several years, her appearance remains unchanged from what Jun`ichi and Nemu remember when she first left for America, which was explained to be so that she will always be as Jun`ichi remembers. She is one of the two returning characters in Da Capo II.",
