  "description" : "Nougami Neuro is a horned bird demon detective from hell who feeds off mysteries/puzzles from objects or people. When he dismantles the mystery it releases energy for him to feed on. He left hell to find a mystery to satisfy his hunger. Once in the human world, he takes on a human form and forces Yako to be his assistant to hide his identity. In public, Yako is seen as the detective while Neuro is the assistant. He treats Yako as a slave and abuses her when he`s in a bad mood; though he does keep her from being harmed in dangerous situations and respects her potential in understanding humans. As a person, he is highly intelligent with a sadistic and arrogant manner who only views humans as food. Neuro mentions throughout the series his desire to consume the \"Ultimate Mystery\", and he will do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. As a demon, he is incredibly powerful and practically invincible to any attacks. By using demonic energy, Neuro is able to use tools called 777 Tools of the Demon World and 7 Weapons of the Demon Court to assist him in solving mysteries. As Neuro remains in the human world away from Shouki, his demonic energy is constantly decreasing, and his body becomes more human. Because of this, he begins to be vulnerable to human weapons. He views Sicks an enemy for endangering his food source.\nSource: wiki",
