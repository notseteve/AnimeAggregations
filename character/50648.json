  "description" : "On their way to Higaki City where the Isshu League would be held, Ash and his friends were challenged to a tag battle by Pokémon Trainers that were brothers. Soran is the older of the two brothers and his younger brother is Riiku. They are a bit cocky and overconfident and their dreams don`t always match what is really happening. Together with the sky warrior Warrgle, Soran controls everything in the sky. Soran and Riiku claim to be the world`s number one siblings but they realized after facing Ash and Cilan that they still had a lot of work to do to actually claim that title.\nSoran and his brother like to use a combination of moves for their attacks and name them appropriate to what the combination produces. This proved to be effective in the tag battle against Ash and Cilan until they also decided to use their own combination of moves which ended up overpowering Soran and Riiku. After realizing that they lost in a double battle, the two brothers decided to blame each other but Cilan decided to help them out and they graciously accepted that help after being humbled in their double battle.\nAfter doing a tasting compatibility, Cilan suggested that they both needed to have a Pokémon that could cope with opposing Pokémon whose types they were weak to at the time. Cilan took Soran and Riiku fishing to catch a Water Pokémon. Soran caught a Buoysel to give him an all-around land-sea-air collection. Soran and Riiku then began their training work at improving their tag battles with their new water Pokémon by developing new combination moves.",
