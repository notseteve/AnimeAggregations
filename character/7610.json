  "description" : "Guchuko is another mysterious creature that appeared in Sunao`s refrigerator, and is somewhat similar to Potemayo in appearance. Guchuko is named by Kyou Takamimori shortly after she ran into Guchuko at school. The name Guchuko is derived from a small chocolate ball called a guchu which Guchuko likes to eat, and -ko added at the end, since it is a common ending for female given names in Japan. Guchuko carries a unique scythe (which looks somewhat like an axe) with a skull on it, and can fire strong energy beams from two living horns (or possibly worms) on either side of her head.",
