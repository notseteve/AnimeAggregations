  "description" : "The Principality of Zeon`s infamous \"Red Comet\" has now become one of the heroes of the AEUG. After the end of the One Year War, Char infiltrated the ranks of the Earth Federation Forces, assuming the alias \"Quattro Bajeena.\" Witnessing the growing tyranny of the Federation`s Titans faction, Char conspired with other dissident Federation officers to organise the secret resistance group known as the AEUG. However, Char has chosen to shirk the burden of command; while quietly advising his fellow AEUG leaders on matters of strategy, he hides behind his Quattro cover identity, insisting that he is merely an ordinary mobile suit pilot.",
