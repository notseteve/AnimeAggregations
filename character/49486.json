  "description" : "Launched sometime in the 2030s, the Macross 5 was the fifth New Macross Class vessel built by the UNG and the 35th long-distance immigration fleet. Unlike other ships of the class, the Battle 5 was constructed by Zentradi and designed with Zentradi technology. Thus the ship looks much smoother and more organic in style than comparable UN Spacy ships of the line. The Battle 5 contained Zentradi colonists in miclone form and the large fleet consisted of two other Macross-like ships in addition to Three Star Factory Ships, Stealth Frigates (Zentradi Variant) and Neo Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class Fleet Command Battleships. The Macross 5 and Macross 7 share similar feautres since both structures were designed by General Galaxy.In early September 2045 the Macross 5 fleet landed upon the habitable planet Rax and began initial preparations for colonization. They contacted the nearby Macross 7 fleet to extend an invitation to visit the new colony world and hoped that the band Fire Bomber would make an appearance due to their popularity among the fleet. When the Macross 7 and it`s fleet arrived in September 2045, the Macross 5 fleet was found destroyed and the colony annihilated. Most of the colonists had been taken captive by the Protodeviln and eventually mind controlled to fill the ranks of the Varauta military.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/newmacross5.htm",
