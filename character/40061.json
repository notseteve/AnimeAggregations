  "description" : "The Seekers of Truth are a secretive faction within the Andrastian Chantry that answer directly to the Divine in Val Royeaux. Not much is known about the organization, its history or responsibilities, but it does appear that they act as a check and balance to the power of the Templar Order, acting in a secretive, investigative and interrogative capacity to root out corruption and protect the Chantry from internal and external threats, much like the inquisition in real life. They also may become involved in the hunting of particularly cunning apostates. Templars fear and despise the Seekers, as they must usually involve themselves when the templars are failing in their duties.",
