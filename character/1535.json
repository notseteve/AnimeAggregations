  "description" : "In the http://anidb.net/a584 [Legend of Galactic Heroes] universe, the Free Planets Alliance, also known as the Alliance or the FPA, is a nation with a democratic government based on the planet Heinessen. During its history, it eventually grew to occupy the Sagittarius Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, and became one of the two centres of human civilization in the galaxy. It was founded by refugees who fled the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] under the leadership of http://anidb.net/ch1026 [Ale Heinessen], but was discovered and attacked, and subsequently waged a seemingly endless war to a stalemate.\nFor several reasons, after almost 160 years of war, the military situation in the Alliance rapidly deteriorated in comparison to the Empire and the war stalemate soon became a massive one-sided victory. The peace treaty imposed by http://anidb.net/ch186 [the Emperor] was very harsh, and the Imperial interference soon led to uprising, which was then used by the Emperor to again declare war. This new war would end in only a few months and lead to the complete dissolution of the Alliance.",
