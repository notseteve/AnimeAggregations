  "description" : "Kastro is a prominent and talented fighter in the Heavens Arena. He hang out on the 200th floor of the Heavens Arena with the intent on building enough wins to become a Floor Master. His only loss is to Hisoka, so he trains rigorously to improve his Nen. After accumulating nine out of the ten required wins to become a Floor Master, he challenges Hisoka to a rematch.\nWhile he appears to have the upper hand at first, Hisoka realizes that Kastro has been working in tandem with a doppelg√§nger created through his Nen.[48] Hisoka then performs an illusion using Nen to throw off Kastro, which leaves an opening for Hisoka to kill him.\nSource: Wiki",
