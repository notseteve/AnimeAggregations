  "description" : "Yukito is the classmate and best friend of Sakura`s brother, Touya Kinomoto. Yukito`s nearly omnipresent smile is evidence of his kind and gentle nature. Yukito also loves food and has an enormous appetite.\nYukito is the false form of the Moon Guardian Yue. Although Yue knows everything about Yukito, Yukito is initially unaware of Yue`s presence. Once Yukito learns of his alter-ego`s existence, the two are able to communicate mentally. It is suggested that Yue is the reason for Yukito`s large appetite, as he is in a sense \"eating for two.\"",
