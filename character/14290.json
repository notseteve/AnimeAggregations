  "description" : "Garcia Lovelace is the only son of Diego Jose San Fernando Lovelace, aged about 12 to 13 at his first appearance. He was heir to the Lovelace family line, and as such, is its current head, the twelfth in succession after his father was assassinated. He was kidnapped for a short while by a Colombian cartel and was transported by the Lagoon Company as \"goods\". He and Roberta left Roanapur shortly afterwards, with some help from Hotel Moscow. He has apparently returned to Roanapur searching for Roberta with a new maid named Fabiola, waiting in a local hotel called the \"Sunken Palace Hotel\" and seemed to have matured greatly in terms of emotional strength, as commented by Rock, since his last appearance. He treats both Roberta and Fabiola as if they were his extended family and in return, both care for him equally. He requests help from Lagoon Company with additional help from Chang, Shenhua, Sawyer, and Rotton. However, the only person he truly trusts in Roanapur is Rock. To stop Roberta, Garcia comes up with the most drastic plan to stop her rampage, fake Caxton`s death with his own hands, thus taking away Roberta`s \"Path of Justice\"; this causes an angry Roberta to hallucinate once more causing her to shoot him; this enabled Garcia to snap Roberta out of it mainly because the promise Roberta made to Garcia of not harming him, a vow she broke.",
