  "description" : "The most mysterious of the Gundam pilots, the young man who calls himself Trowa was sent to Earth as the pilot of the Gundam Heavyarms. The cool, quiet Trowa has nerves of steel and superb reflexes, qualities which serve him well in his cover identity as an acrobatic clown in a traveling circus troupe. He also has soldiering experience far beyond his years. When combined with his heavily-armed Gundam, Trowa`s tactical skill and combat ability make him a veritable one-man army.",
