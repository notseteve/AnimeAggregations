  "description" : "Torako`s older brother, who has been bullying his sister since childhood. Among the students, Kitusne is known to be an `extreme sadist`. Despite being Torako`s brother, he seems to have no resemblance to her in terms of both appearance and personality. He wears a safety pin on his left ear like an earring contrasted by the silver clip Torako wears and a silver bell Oniyuri wears both on their left ears. Because of his extreme sadism, he views Ayumi to be the perfect target of torment, as he often lifts up her skirt or asks if he can. He seems to prefer torturing her and Torako. He and Ayumi also tend to run into each other randomly, with Kitsune either doing something nice to her(such as giving her his fox mask at the festival or splitting an ice cream with her) or saying something perverted. It is stated that whenever he torments Torako, Suzume doesn`t help because Kitsune bribes her with snacks, thus Suzume likes him.",
