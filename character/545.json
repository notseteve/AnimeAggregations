  "description" : "Hoothoot is one of two owl Pok√©mon. Hoothoot seems to have one foot. However, it actually has two feet; at least one is retracted against its body at almost all times, and Hoothoot can switch between one foot and the other at speeds almost too fast for the human eye. Hoothoot are also known for having precise senses of time, due to a special mechanism in their brain that measures the rotation of the earth. Properly trained, they can be more accurate than all but the most precise of clocks. In nature, they always begin hooting at the same time every night.",
