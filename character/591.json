  "description" : "Jumpluff is the final form of the Hoppip evolutionary line. Its body is a blue circle with three cotton balls around and has two small red eyes. They are a migratory species Pok√©mon. They take advantage of their light weight and fluffy, buoyant cotton balls to take to the skies. They are very adept at catching the warm southern winds and navigating their way to any location in the world, typically overseas and until they encounter a cold air current, whereupon they will begin landing. While floating, Jumpluff release spores that propagate its offspring around the world. This method of reproduction is reminiscent of dandelions.",
