  "description" : "A sixteen year old honour student in Japan who lives an ordinary life; her primary worry is her naturally red hair. When a man named Keiki suddenly appears at her school, he bows at her feet, swearing loyalty to her and offering protection; when the school is attacked by a giant bird, she reluctantly accepts his oath. He gives her a sword and transports her across the Void Sea to the Twelve Kingdoms, where she ends up in the Kingdom of Kou.\nYouko is initially confused by the changes that have been brought onto her, including a complete change in her appearance and being stranded in an unknown land with no means of returning home. As she searches for Keiki, she finds herself constantly battling against demons and being betrayed many times. While Youko becomes wary of trusting others, she eventually comes to befriend and trust a hanjyu named Rakushun. They escape to the Kingdom of En, where Youko learns that she is the heir to the throne of the kingdom of Kei, and although she is initially reluctant, she accepts the position through her growth in the story.",
