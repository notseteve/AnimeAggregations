  "description" : "Zacian is a Fairy-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a second form activated by giving Zacian a Rusted Sword to hold. Its original form, Hero of Many Battles, will then become the Fairy/Steel-type Crowned Sword.\nZacian is the game mascot of Pokémon Sword, appearing on the boxart.\nAccording to legends, Zacian is believed to be the elder sister or rival of Zamazenta. It is also known as Fairy King`s Sword by friends and foes due to it cutting down anything in one strike. It can turn itself into a statue in order to slumber until need and is capable of flying. When together with Zamazenta it can negate the power of Eternatus, even in its Eternamax State. By absorbing the metal particles in the land, it can change its form. It can also cast illusions including a projection of itself even when asleep.\nZacian can attack so gracefully the movements can captivate its opponents, which has been compare to a graceful dance. The sword it holds in its mouth can cut through anything with a sharp edge capable of harming even the thick scales of Dragon-type Pokémon as if they were just paper. When Zacian slashes its opponents it moves faster than the blinking eye, thus those struck down by its sword will not feel the pain until they fall down. When using its signature move, it can cut the ocean in two. Zacian can sheathe its sword when not in use by wrapping it with its mane.\nZacian is the only known Pokémon capable of using Behemoth Blade.",
