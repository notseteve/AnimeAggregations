  "description" : "Yanagihara Tamotsu is a police investigator and a close acquaintance of http://anidb.net/ch16960 [Rin], first introduced in episode one. He enjoys Rin`s company and provides her with useful information. He is killed by a military sniper following AI Ruon`s orders in episode four. Immediately before his death, he reminisces about what may have been an intimate moment with Rin. He is affectionately referred to as \"Tamo\" by Rin, and despite his constant (bad) attempts to keep their meetings low-key during the first two episodes, he does not object to being called by that name.",
