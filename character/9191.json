  "description" : "Guiche de Gramont is one of Louise`s classmates who, despite being in love with http://anidb.net/ch7092 [Montmorency], is a conceited playboy who cannot decide which girl he really wants. He comes from a noble family with a deep military history (His father`s a general). He always carries an artificial rose with him, the stem of which is his wand. He also likes to dote upon his familiar, a giant mole named Belldandy. As his familiar indicates, his specialty is earth magic.\n[i]He is named for Armand de Graumont, Comte de Guiche (1637-1673), a French nobleman who became the lover of Princess Henrietta Anne Stuart.\nSource: Wikipedia[/i]",
