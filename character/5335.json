  "description" : "Doll is one of the three artificial humans created by the Senshi Civilization with the purpose to defeat Gaia. After Gaia`s defeat, it and Doll were sent underground with Doll`s memory of the events erased. She was soon unearthed and discovered by Naua as an infant with pink hair and was adopted as Mexiah Furan, who became Chiaia`s older sister.\nDoll has little regard for the importance of life, shown when she laughs while trying to kill Aura during an early encounter. Despite this, she has an attraction to Kenshi that she believes is a remnant of when Mexiah`s personality was dominant. When piloting her Seikijin, she can easily defeat any opponent except for Kenshi, the only one who can stand his ground against her. In the last episode Doll realises she loves Kenshi as does her other half Mexiah. Her Seikijin wields both a scythe, which doubles as a gun, and the Shield of Gaia, a massive and indestructible shield with a mouth capable of eating parts of her opponents, and its black color implies that she may be the legendary \"Seikishi of Darkness\" destined to destroy the world and Kenshi`s nemesis.\nDoll bears a close resemblance to the character Neju Na Melmas from Tenchi Muyo! GXP and the character D from Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure in terms of appearance (they all share a child-like appearance) and hair color (green).\nSource: Wiki",
