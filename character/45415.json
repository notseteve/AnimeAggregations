  "description" : "Junko Jenko is a highly advanced Mobile Suit Pilot, and a member of the Shrike Team, later becoming second-in-command upon Helen Jackson`s demise. Junko has a tendency to get in too deep in battle, which often makes Shrike Team leader Oliver Inoe worry that she is in a rush to get killed. Her closeness to Oliver often leads to a few scuffles with fellow League Millitaire pilot Marbet Fingerhat.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
