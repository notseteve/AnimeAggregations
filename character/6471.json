  "description" : "Nicknamed Yasako, which is another reading of 優子 meaning \"gentle girl\". With her sister Kyouko and her two parents, Yasako moves to the city of Daikoku to live with her grandmother, Megabaa. Yasako is a sweet and passive girl who follows the lead of Fumie, who eventually initiates her into Megabaa`s Coil Cyber Detective Agency as its eighth member. Yasako has been to the city of Daikoku seven years ago for her grandfather`s funeral. A pair of dennou eyeglasses and the virtual pet Densuke were left to her as a memento.\nDuring her time in Daikoku, she coincidentally wandered into the Coil Domain where she befriended a young boy with the codename 4423. After Yasako returns to live in Daikoku, her hazy memories of that enigmatic friendship gradually return to haunt her. Her father Ichirou works at a Dennou technology company, Megamass, which deploys Searchmaton in Daikoku.",
