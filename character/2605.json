  "description" : "Captain of the Library Task Force and is ranked Library Supervisor Third Class. It is partly due to him that Kasahara is drafted into the task force, though since he is the captain, he had the final say. He is very strong, and Kasahara even thinks he has enough brawn to take on a bear full force. He is skilled in military command operations and in politics, such as giving Media Betterment Act agents books and magazines the Library Defence Force had copies of during an operation so that they do not leave empty handed either.",
