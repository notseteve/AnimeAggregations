  "description" : "Aira is a Member of the Magician`s Guild and Louie`s friend. Despite many attempts to get Louie on a date; especially considering her rather voluptuous frame; their relationship remains platonic and open much to her dismay. Although highly knowledgeable in magic theory and magical item lore, her chief area of study, Ila herself claims to be inferior to Louie in raw magical prowess.\nShe also tends to go to pieces and pass out whenever trouble surfaces on adventures she tags along with. In the manga, Ila`s character is more sultry than in the anime and she especially enjoys getting Louie flustered by flirting with him.",
