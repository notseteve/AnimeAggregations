  "description" : "Aloe is the Gym Leader of Shippo City Gym. Trainers that defeat her are given the Basic Badge. She met Ash and his friends at the Shippo City Museum where she arrived to help figure out the mystery behind the mysterious poltergeist that was scarring Kidachi. She agreed to battle Ash after she solved the mystery of Desumasu`s mask.\nThe Shippo Gym is located inside the Shippo City museum and Aloe also works as the curator of the museum itself. She runs an archive full of valuable books and research papers that ordinary people are not permitted to view without her permission. Only people who want to use it for examinations, research and Gym match challengers can use the book archive. The library in the museum that Aloe also runs has the most books in the Isshu region.\nAloe tests her challengers as soon as they enter the archive area. She suggests a book to each of them that leads them straight to the underground battlefield but most decide to read up on a subject they are proficient despite the fact that she is actually showing them the shortest route to the Gym. Ash straightforwardness did exactly as Aloe suggested and he picked the book that she suggested, revealing the stairs to the gym right away. Most challengers read too much into her actions and end up taking a detour.\nIn her first match against Ash she defeated him by studying him and getting to know his tenancies. She revealed her two Pok√©mon, Aloe`s Yorterry and Aloe`s Miruhog before the match so he could study them as well. In the end, Aloe`s studying of Ash proved to be the turning point in the match and she was able to defeat him. She told Ash to return and battle her again though.",
