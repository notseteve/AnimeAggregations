  "description" : "Hitmontop has a sharp point on the top of its head which allows it to balance itself upside-down on its head, the position which it holds in much of the time while it is observed. While it can walk upright, it often travels by spinning like a top, letting it travel much faster. Using the centrifugal force to boost its attack by ten times, it launches elegant kicks while spinning. This allows it to throw off its opponent`s timing, and give it a good mix of offense and defense. If it spins fast enough, it can dig into the ground. Any punch or hand based moves breed into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmontop can know a move like Mach Punch or High Jump Kick.",
