  "description" : "The main character of the series, Ikko is able to release a powerful but uncontrollable power when confronted with intense lust. Each time, in the aftermath of his \"awakening,\" he will bear a face of lust, and will \"attack\" Chitose or the other nuns, who respond by running from him and attacking him. Ikkou seems not to enjoy his life at the temple (at least at the beginning of the series) and often complains that he is missing out on his youth. He seems not to have chosen the monastic life and resents the work given to him. He does not seem to have good grades in school nor does he seem to participate in any particular club at school.",
