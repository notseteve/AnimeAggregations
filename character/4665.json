  "description" : "A cram school student, and second-year ronin studying to enter Tokyo University (or \"Toudai\" for short). When Keitarou was a child, he made a promise with a girl based on a story that two people who love each other will live \"happily ever after\" if they enter Tokyo University. After being kicked out of home for failing to pass the entrance exams on his second attempt, he travels to \"Hinata Inn\", a Hotel owned by his Grandmother in order to find a place to stay and study. After a misunderstanding, Keitarou discovers the Hotel is now a Girls only Dorm. Keitarou`s Aunt Haruka mistakenly assumes he has already passed the entrance exams and is already studying at Tokyo University, and the residents agree he can stay. When he fails to correct her and is discovered to be lying, he is forced to leave until Haruka announces the Inn now belongs to Keitarou and he is the new landlord.",
