  "description" : "Miru is one of the new Lemon Angels. She has long, flowing black hair, and seems to dress in the Gothic Lolita style. Very soft spoken and does not talk or sing unless she really needs to. She lost her parents in a fire at a young age and became a hikkikomori until she listened to the Lemon Angels. From that day forward, she wanted to become just like Anne, the lead singer for the last group, and also wanted to be the lead singer of the newly formed Lemon Angels, but withdrew from her desires once she discovered that Tomo was just like Anne and deserved to be lead singer instead.",
