  "description" : "Gladion`s Zoroark initially belonged to Gladion`s father but it left when Mohn disappeared. It joined up with Gladion and agreed to help search for Mohn.\nIn the Alola League finals, it was sent out in disguise with an illusion as Lycanroc. After a Thunderbolt from Pikachu, the illusion failed and Ash Ketchum realized he was fighting a Zoroark. Gladion thought there was nothing that could outmaneuver Zoroarkâ€™s Never-Ending Nightmare Z-Move but Pikachu countered with Breakneck Blitz and both Pikachu and Zoroark were knocked out at the same time.",
