  "description" : "He is a rather typical of a Gundam protagonist, the beginning of the series shows him growing as a poor junk dealer at the space colony of Shangrila in Side 1. He`s rather loudmouthed and straightfoward but has a good heart and displays Newtype abilities. Unlike most Gundam protagonists, he is optimistic and happy-go-lucky, instead of being anti-social or brooding (Amuro Ray and Kamille Bidan being prime examples). Judau is a young teenage boy enthralled with mobile suits and an avid supporter of the AEUG. He also has a younger sister Leina, whom he might catfight repeatedly with, but still cares very deeply for.",
