  "description" : "James`s Oricorio is a Clap-Clap Style. It is a Dance Pok√©mon and it creates electricity by rubbing its feathers together. It dances over to its enemies and attacks. It changes type by means of the nectar of flowers unique to the individual islands in the Alola region. It became an Electric/Flying type thanks to the bright yellow nectar unique to Melemele Island. It battled against Ash`s Rowlet and was able to defeat it as it was a lot more experienced in battling and had a type advantage.",
