  "description" : "Another goddess and Nagi`s twin sister. Opposite to Nagi, Zange`s tree is still intact and located in a church`s courtyard, thus she is still able to catch and cleanse impurities by herself. The fact that she switched her character to that of a Catholic nun, as it is a stronger religion nowadays according to her, contributed to her divinity staying intact. Despite seemingly being kind and caring on the outside, she usually takes advantage of Nagi`s weakened state to torment her. The word zange in Japanese means `penitence` or `confession`.",
