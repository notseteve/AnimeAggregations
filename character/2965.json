  "description" : "Akiba Itsuki is loud, reckless, and shameless, and seems to be a complete opposite of Iori, including her affinity towards wearing boyish clothing and having a short haircut. Itsuki and Ichitaka had been friends since grade school, with Itsuki (although a year younger) often being an emotional coach to Ichitaka, particularly with women. The two seemed to become closer than friends in their young life, a relationship that was suddenly interrupted when Itsuki moved away to America years before the series begins. Itsuki just as abruptly returns to Ichitaka`s life soon after the series starts, now a fully grown young lady, but still with real feelings for Ichitaka. But later in the series, she goes back to America to work with a world-renowned sculptor, and is further unseen. She occasionally appears in Ichitaka`s mind to scold him during his bouts of self-pity, though these manifestations are really Ichitaka`s subconscious trying to tell him something important.\nSource: Wikipedia",
