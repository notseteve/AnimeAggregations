  "description" : "Segawa Kotetsu is the combat butler of the Segawa family and the older fraternal twin brother of http://anidb.net/ch640 [Segawa Izumi]. As a running gag, his hobby is his extreme love of trains and train turntables. He seems to be shy as he has never had the confidence to ask a girl out. It seems that his terrible luck with women has left him feeling bitter about the entire female gender, but while he is at http://anidb.net/ch530 [Hinagiku]`s birthday party, he runs into http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate] and immediately falls in love with him, or rather his alter-ego http://anidb.net/ch9407 [Hermione]. He soon learns of Hayate`s identity from Izumi. Angered by this, he kidnaps http://anidb.net/ch528 [Nagi] in order to bring Hayate out. After Nagi confronts him on his shallow attitude towards love in general, he vows to change his attitude and still likes Hayate even after discovering that he is male. He seems extremely hung up on Hayate and uses various methods to try to spend time with him, such as challenging him to ping pong to get him to spend time in a hot spring they were both visiting. He is rarely seen in the first season of the anime, making brief appearances once in a while, although Izumi has referred to him several times; he gets a larger role in the second season.",
