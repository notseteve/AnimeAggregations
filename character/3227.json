  "description" : "The Jones family butler. He is often a go-between for William and his father, and his duty to the head of the house, Mr. Jones, often forces Stevens to seem uncaring of William`s difficulties concerning his courtship of Emma. Several times, during the course of the series, Stevens has been at the sharp end of some gentleman`s displeasure through no fault of his own, but his tact and devotion to the Jones family resolves every situation in a face saving gesture of servility.\n(Wikipedia)",
