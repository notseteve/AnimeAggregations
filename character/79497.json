  "description" : "Kagetomo is a ninja that was trained in the Ninja Village until he decided that he wanted to have enough power to rule over the world. He was captured Hanzo and wanted to start by taking control of the village to be their chieftain.\nKagetomo at one point was considered the favorite for the roll of the chieftain but he strayed from Hanzo`s teachings and the mission of a ninja to keep training together with Pokémon, to pursue the potential of Pokémon and to utilize it for the sake of the world, for the sake of others. Hanzo refused to give the ninja symbol to Kagetomo for those reasons.\nIppei defeated Kagetomo in a Pokémon battle and as a result, Kagetomo realized he wasn`t strong enough yet but he also had a change of heart. He wanted to reconsider and rediscipline himself as he couldn`t get Hanzo`s words out of his head about use his powers for the sake of others. He then said he wanted to see what society is striving for.",
