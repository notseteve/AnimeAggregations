  "description" : "The Silvana is an airborne capital ship captained by Alex Row, a former Vanship courier, who is permitted an amazing degree of liberty in its use. The vessel`s Claudia unit was acquired from a renegade Guild member opposed to the rule of Maestro Delphine Eraclea. It is the only capital ship (outside of the initially secret Urbanus-class) on Prester not under the control of the Guild, and thus the only one that can effectively oppose it.",
