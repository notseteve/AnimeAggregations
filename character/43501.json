Nobunaga specializes in combining Nen with the use of his katana in executing enemies. His best friend is Uvogin, and the two bring out the best of each other during combat. Seeing some of Uvogin`s personality in Gon, he expresses interest in having Gon join the Troupe, though Gon adamantly refuses. Nobunaga ranks ninth in physical power among the Troupe, and is one of the original members from Meteor City. Nen type: Enhancement\nSource: Wiki",
