Trapped in his luxury mansion, and deeply scarred by his traumatic wartime experiences, Amuro is initially content to leave the fighting to other people this time. However, his old friends eventually goad Amuro back into action, and he goes on to become the foremost ace of the Karaba resistance group.\nSource: Official Site",
