Most of his face is wrapped in bandages, and he usually has a cigarette in his mouth.\nTonbo made his first appearance during the written section of the Chuunin Exams as one of the various shinobi looking out for cheaters.

In the anime, Tonbo and Tatami Iwashi alerted http://anidb.net/ch8606 [Tsunade] about Mizuki and the Legendary Stupid Brothers having escaped prison together.\nTonbo, along with http://anidb.net/ch17691 [Hijiri Shimon] and http://anidb.net/ch17692 [Mozuku], facilitated in http://anidb.net/ch10962 [Yamanaka Inoichi]`s Mind Reading of http://anidb.net/ch17695 [Yuudachi]. He complimented the speed at which Inoichi could read his memories, although Mozuku harshly scolded him for not concentrating on probing Yuudachi. When the invasion of Pain starts, they help distract the Animal Path to give Inoichi a chance to analyze what he has learned.",
