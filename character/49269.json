  "description" : "The VF-17S is a variant to the standard Nightmare variable fighter featuring increased firepower and more powerful engines. It has become accepted practice in the UN Spacy to assign slightly modified variable fighters to team leaders and command officers so the VF-17S was built in line with that operational policy. Featuring a new head unit with one extra sensor installed, firepower is improved with four anti-aircraft laser guns rather than just a single pair of guns. The VF-17S is also designed with two Shinnakasu Heavy Industry/P&W/Roice FF-2100X Custom thermonuclear turbine engines that provide an additional 9,000 kg [x g] of thrust. Diamond Force commander Lt. http://anidb.net/ch43638 [Kinryuu] piloted a VF-17S with a yellow highlighted hull while serving aboard the Macross 7 in 2045. Later http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki] would pilot his own VF-17S and City 7 Mayor and veteran ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch41157 [Milia Fallyna Jenius] would fly a custom red VF-17S.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/vf-17s-nightmare.htm",
