  "description" : "The main heroine and leader of the Nega Nebulus legion, her real name is unknown, although Sky Raker refers to her by the nickname \"Sacchan\". Her pseudonym is a Japanese word play with Snow White (Shirayukihime, 白雪姫, literally \"White Snow Princess\"). Beautiful and popular, she is also the Student Council Vice-President at Umesato Junior High School. She has been a Burst Linker since she was eight years old. Kuroyukihime was formerly the Black King, although she was driven into hiding after beheading the first Red King, Red Rider, while trying to defeat the other kings to reach level 10. She values Haru as more than a subordinate and is often the voice of reason to him when he is willing to go to extremes to protect her. Prior to her hospitalization, she confesses to Haru that she fell in love with him. Her non-accelerated avatar is her real-world self dressed in black and sporting red and black butterfly wings. She was apparently born on September 30, 2032 according to her forged identity in episode 9. She is estranged from her family since she injured her sister, who is also the White King, out of anger after learning that she was tricked by her.\nSource: Wiki",
