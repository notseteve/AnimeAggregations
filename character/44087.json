  "description" : "Ikuto`s father appears only in flashback scenes. He is strict and doesn`t allow http://anidb.net/ch8589 [Ikuto] making his own decisions until he were able to defeat him, which is \"impossible\" as he permanently states (and thus became the word that Ikuto hates the most). A quarrel with his father was the reason for Ikuto to run away from home, only to be shipwrecked at the beginning of this story.",
