  "description" : "Kochou Shinobu is the current Insect Pillar. She is rather cool-headed and always has a smile on her face, no matter what situation she`s put in. She enjoys teasing others and claims that she wishes that demons and humans would get along. Despite this claim, she doesn`t hesitate to kill demons, showing no sympathy towards them. She initially takes pity on http://anidb.net/ch99459 [Nezuko] for being turned into a demon; she offers to kill her painlessly with poison. She later shows compassion towards Nezuko and http://anidb.net/ch99458 [Tanjirou] after hearing their story.\nSource: Wikipedia",
