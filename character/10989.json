  "description" : "The GM - pronounced \"Jim\" - is a mass-produced version of the RX-78 Gundam, introduced just before the end of the war. In order to reduce its cost, the GM omits the Gundam`s expensive Luna Titanium armor, Core Block system, and spare beam saber, and substitutes a short-range beam spray gun for the Gundam`s beam rifle. Still, it`s an effective close-combat mobile suit, and in the final campaigns of the war the GM turns the tide in favor of the Federation Forces.",
