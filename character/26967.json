  "description" : "Niijima Haruo is a member of the Newspaper Club and investigates everyone. Niijima dreams of eventually ruling the world and formed the Alliance for that purpose. He has a broad range of expertise, including stealth, lock picking, tinkering and programming; he once constructed rudimentary traps while he was simultaneously running around an arena at high speed. He is very adept at dodging attacks and running away. Despite his cowardly tactics, he has shown himself to be a cunning individual and a skilled tactician. If forced to battle, Niijima relies on hit-and-run and psychological tactics to un-nerve his opponents and render them more vulnerable. His is so skilled, that both friend and enemy have complimented him. Many times throughout the series, Niijima appears to use Ken`ichi as a tool, but then later displays a random and sometimes irksome act of kindness, making Ken`ichi question their \"friendship\" from time to time. In the beginning of the series, Niijima is constantly bullying Ken`ichi, calling him names and setting him up with other bullies, but over time, as Ken`ichi becomes stronger, Niijima seems to attach himself to Ken`ichi, considering himself to be his \"best friend\". He constantly relies on Ken`ichi to get him out of danger, and tells the members of the Shinpaku alliance that he has always had Ken`ichi`s back and has never let him down, leading them to believe he is a kind and selfless leader.\nHis senses are superhumanly acute, he is able to \"scan\" individuals by observing them for a few seconds, learning a wide variety of physical, mental, emotional, and other information about them.",
