  "description" : "Sakurajima Mai is a 3rd year student at Minegahara High Schoolâ€”well known, famous actress, who is currently on hiatus. Because her life had always revolved around her work in entertainment, she remains isolated at school. She`s serious and polite, but has a strong will. She`s overall levelheaded and very kind and helpful, denouncing Sakuta`s bad reputation as false and also having a very soft spot for Kaede. While she can be snarky, she`s pure-hearted, and sometimes even shy around Sakuta`s lewd jokes. Like Sakuta, she`s also very selfless, sacrificing herself to save her boyfriend`s life and become Shoko`s heart donor, though she will be saved by Sakuta.\nSource: Official site & Wikipedia",
