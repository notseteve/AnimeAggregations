  "description" : "Hayden`s Tauros battled against Pikachu in a Pokémon World Championships Normal Class battle in a park in Vermilion City just after Goh caught his Exeggcute. Goh`s Rotom Phone noted that the Tauros herd member with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is said to be the leader. Goh then looked at Hayden`s Tauros`s horns to see that they were long, thick, and really scarred and realized that it might be a leader. Despite the initial worry of Tauros being a very strong Pokémon, it was defeated by Pikachu to give Ash Ketchum the battle victory.",
