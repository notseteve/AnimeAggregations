  "description" : "Ahmey is a warrior lancer, and the first person Kaaya recruited for her climber party. She exhibits a quiet and stoic attitude most of the time, and often appears to be uncomfortable when forced to speak. At first, she seemed to be a very silent and aloof person, but later revealed a more feminine and naive side. She is the most experienced member of the group, and has travelled the furthest in the tower. Because of this, she tends to act as a leader of sorts, as well as explaining the system and design of the Tower.",
