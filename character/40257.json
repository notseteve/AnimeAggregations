  "description" : "Bub is Chihiro`s pet cat that died in a car accident three days prior to the start of the series. He`s named after the tamed zombie in the movie Day of the Dead. He was brought back to life by Chihiro while doing research of resurrection on him. Rea seems to understand Bub as a zombie. Like Rea, his body is not restrained by his brain and was able to kill a much bigger fox. However, unlike Rea, he has not been able to starve off his zombie instincts.\nSource: Wikipedia",
