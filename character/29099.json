  "description" : "Enma-kun is the leader of the Spirit Patrol group - a group dedicated to defeating evil spirits.\nHis http://anidb.net/ch29109 [uncle] is the judge of the afterlife down in the underworld, and he has told Enma-kun to capture as many evil spirits as possible and bring them back down to the underworld... but Enma sees the work as nothing but a chore. He`s fairly confident that any spirits that appear will be quick work when he uses his magic to burn them into ashes, and in all honestly he would rather be trying to find a way to sneak a peek at http://anidb.net/ch29110 [Yuki]-chan`s naked body instead of searching for evil spirits.\nSource: Official Site",
