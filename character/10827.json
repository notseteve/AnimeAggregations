  "description" : "Also known as the Witch of Miracles and greatly resembles Furude Rika from Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Her name also suggests some connection to Rika`s \"alter-ego\", Frederica Bernkastel (which is hinted when Bernkastel quotes herself saying Rika`s trademark \"Ni~pa\" sound). It is said she resides in a world where concepts such as fate and probability can be visualised. She appears to see Beatrice`s game to ease her boredom. She assists the player by giving some hints around the workings of the game. Her \"Magic of Miracles\" allows her to reset a desperate situation as long as the probability of a favourable situation is not equal to zero. Like Lambdadelta, she is a Voyager: a witch able to move to the territory of other witches without losing her power. She wants Battler to win.",
