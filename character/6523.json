  "description" : "The main antagonist. He is the man who killed Teito`s `Father` and seeks the Eye of Mikhail, though he seems to also be searching for `Zehel`. His relationship with the 07-Ghosts is unknown, but he seems to be working for Verloren. It has been revealed that Ayanami is the owner of Frau`s scythe; however, how his scythe came into Frau`s possession is still unknown. He is a cold and merciless character, and will not hesitate to kill someone without remorse. The sometimes crazy antics of his subordinates annoy him to no end. He is very dedicated to his country. His cruelty really shows when he holds Mikage in for questioning after Teito`s escape; he gives Mikage the choice between telling him where Teito went or he would kill his family. He then possesses Mikage`s soul and when Mikage finally finds Teito, takes over his body and forces him to attack Teito. In the end, Teito and Frau are forced to kill Mikage, which takes its toll on Teito emotionally. Ayanami later states that it was necessary to kill Mikage in front of Teito`s very own eyes so that Teito would come after Ayanami in revenge.",
