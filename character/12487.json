  "description" : "Umi is the only child of a rich family and goes to a school for \"privileged\" girls.\nShe is quick-tempered and at first uncaring and selfish, though perhaps the best-suited for the task at hand, but is also the most reluctant. As Magic Knight Rayearth progresses, she starts to care for other people and better understand the Magic Knights` situation. Perhaps this is because she is a \"privileged\" girl.\nInterestingly enough Umi is the first Magic Knight to revive her Guardian.\nShe is the Magic Knight of Water and her name translates to \"Sea Dragon Blossom\".",
