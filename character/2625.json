  "description" : "Dr. Fuji is a character in the first Pokémon movie, Mewtwo Strikes Back. He is also featured in The Birth of Mewtwo. He is mentioned in the games as the founder of Pokémon Lab.\nAfter his daughter Amber died, he devoted his life to trying to bring her back through cloning. His wife could not go on watching him try to bring their dead daughter back to life and so she left him, and still, he worked.\nEventually, his studies gained the attention of Giovanni, who said he would fund Fuji`s project if Fuji also cloned the legendary Pokémon, Mew. This resulted in the creation of Mewtwo.\nAfter the original Charmandertwo, Bulbasaurtwo, and Squirtletwo died during the experiment, Ambertwo, the cloned form of Amber, died as well, leading Dr. Fuji to panic and administer a form of emotion-suppressing serum to Mewtwo which may have caused its seemingly twisted personality. Shortly after gaining sentience, Mewtwo blew up their lab on New Island, presumably killing everyone there (including Fuji).",
