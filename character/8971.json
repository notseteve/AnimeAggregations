  "description" : "Usually seen smiling, Maria is one of the central characters of the series. Two years ago during the events of 428: Fuusa Sareta Shibuya de, she was abducted by Snake terrorists and they infected her with the Ua virus to force her father, Kenji Oosawa, to make them a cure to the Ua virus to save her life. While her life was saved thanks to her father`s anti-virus, the trauma she endured during the Shibuya incident made her suffer amnesia. As a result, she cannot remember certain events during that incident, including not remembering having met Alphard before. Prior to the Shibuya incident, she befriended Canaan after being saved from hoodlums during a trip somewhere in the Middle East. As her dream is to become a photographer, she became the partner of Minoru Minorikawa before the pair`s assignment in Shanghai and her subsequent reuniting with Canaan.\nSource: Wikipedia",
