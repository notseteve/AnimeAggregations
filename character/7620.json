  "description" : "Left for dead after the brutal murder of all six members of her family, Henrietta is the newest addition to the Agency as the story begins. She was raped repeatedly next to the dead bodies all night, which had inflicted psychological trauma to her, making her suicidal. This could be the reason her uterus was removed, as she explains to Triela that she can`t have periods. Her struggle is the most developed of all the girls as she adjusts to her new life. Henrietta`s favorite activity is to spend time with her handler, Jose(Guiseppe?), and they are fond of stargazing together. Whenever Jose seems to turn his attention to other women (including the other cyborgs of the SWA), Henrietta becomes slightly jealous. This is due to Henrietta`s strong romantic feelings for Jose, as a result of her conditioning and the care he gives her. Her name is often shortened to \"`Etta\". While there are several scenes where she primarily uses her left hand (readjusting her bag from her right hand to her left before hitting a person with it; using a submachine gun with her left hand; eating using a spoon), she usually fires pistols using her right hand. Henrietta`s preferred weapons are the SIG Sauer P239 Two-Tone, the Fabrique Nationale P90 PDW, and the FN FAL (present in the manga only). With the exception of the Walther WA 2000 sniper rifle, and Jose`s Ingram MAC-10, both of which anime-specific, the Henrietta/Jose fratello use exclusively Fabrique Nationale and SiG weapons (Jose uses the FN Five-seveN).\n[Source: wikipedia]",
