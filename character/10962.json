  "description" : "Yamanaka Inoichi is a Jounin from Konohagakure, and, alongside Nara Shikaku and Akimichi Chouza, is a part of the first Ino-Shika-Cho trio, as well as the father of http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Yamanaka Ino]. He runs his family`s flower shop.\nInoichi, presumably the head of the Yamanaka clan, has shown himself to be a highly capable ninja. He is well-versed in all of his clan`s secret techniques. During the Invasion of Konoha in Part I, Inoichi skilfully performs the Mind Body Disturbance Technique to make the invaders he encounters fight against their own allies without any self-control. Further proof of his skill was shown from his status as an interrogator during http://anidb.net/ch11993 [Pain]`s invasion. He was able to skilfully probe the mind of one Pain`s http://anidb.net/ch12202 [Amegakure] loyalist`s even though Pain had guarded it with mental blocks and traps. He has also shown the ability to communicate telepathically with his daughter, Ino.\nHe is also skilled at tracking targets through their chakra trail, as long as the target`s chakra signature stays the same.",
