  "description" : "By 2047, the VF-19 Excalibur had begun deployment in even the outermost colonies of the UNG. The planet Zola military forces made use of a special Zolan variant called the VF-19P colored off white with red highlights. http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara] visited the planet Zola and became involved in an incident during the space whale migration. Using the power of his music, http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] piloted a special customized version of the VF-19P outfitted with speaker units designed by a Zolan scientist named Lawrence to engage the space whales in orbit. In the VF-19P http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] assisted the space whales during their migration cycle. The VF-19P itself was near a reaction warhead detonation that struck the white space whale, the resulting injury caused the great beast to send forth a spray of pollen that stained the Battroid red (Macross Chronicle, Issue #22). To the untrained eye, it appeared as if once again http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] was piloting his old Fire Valkyrie from the Protodeviln War in 2045-2046.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/vf-19p.htm",
