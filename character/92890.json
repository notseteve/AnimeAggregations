  "description" : "Climb is the personal bodyguard of princess http://anidb.net/ch92895 [Renner]. She saved him when he was just a street urchin about to die from sickness. As such, he views his services to her as a fulfilling of that debt he owes and is even willing to give up his life for her. However, he remains unaware of Renner`s true nature.\nHe is rather disliked due to him having such a position despite not even being a commoner, but an urchin. Despite this position, he holds no talent in fighting, making up for it with sheer effort. He eventually meets http://anidb.net/ch72781 [Sebas] and, after convincing him to teach him some of his skills, they become friends, though he remains unaware of his loyalty towards http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz].\nSource: Wikipedia",
