  "description" : "A very shy and silent girl, with particularly powerful Psychodriver abilities. Mai is loyal to those that have helped her, including her sister Aya, her father Kenzo, her crush Ryusei Date and the rest of the SRX Team. She also seems to be particularly close to Latune Subbota, Shine Hausen, Arado Balanga and Seolla Schweitzer, probably due to their similar ages.\nMai has a crush on fellow SRX Team member Ryusei Date. This gives her a sort of rivalry with Latune Subbota for his affection, however, they remain close friends. She`s adapted some of his mannerisms, including shouting during attacks. This crush is taken to its logical conclusion in Super Robot Wars Original Generations, in which Mai (piloting the ART-1) and Ryusei (piloting the R-1) get a combination attack, the T-Link Double Knuckle.\nAs Levi, Mai has a completely different personality. Believing herself to be the leader of the Balmarians, due to mind-washing, Levi is ruthless, sees humans as nothing more than weaponry for the Balmarians, and seems to have little concern for anything other than her. She`s also particularly egocentric, thinking that nothing can defeat her and her Judecca.",
