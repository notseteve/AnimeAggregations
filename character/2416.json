  "description" : "One of the Gundam mobile suits possessed by Celestial Being. Like the other Gundams, the Kyrios is equipped with a GN Drive that gives it almost limitless energy and remarkable mobility. This transformable mobile suit can change into a flight form for high-speed hit and run attacks, and a variety of weapons containers can be attached to the tail of its flight form to suit the mission. In both its flight form and its mobile suit form, the Kyrios far surpasses the transformable mobile suits used by the Union and the AEU. Its GN Shield can also function as a claw and houses a lethal hidden weapon.",
