  "description" : "Eelektross, known as the Electric Fish Pokémon, is the evolution of Eelektrik. It evolves from Eelektrik when it contacts a Thunderstone. Eelektross is an eel-like Pokémon that resembles a lamprey, with a long tentacle-like, finned limb extending from its head. It has red eyes, dark blue body, and, unlike its earlier evolutions, possesses clawed, paddle-like arms with yellow spots and yellow-and-red palms. It has a beige fin on the upper portion of its body and beige fin-like legs below. It is also the final evolution of Tynamo. Eelektross and its evolutionary relatives are the only Pokémon to have no weaknesses other than Ghost/Dark. However, this is due to their Levitate ability, which eliminates what would be their sole weakness to the Ground type.",
