  "description" : "An unarmed variable fighter, the VT-1 \"Ostrich\" is the UN Spacy`s first dedicated training Valkyrie. Like the http://anidb.net/ch48788 [VF-1D], the Ostrich is a two-seater variant of the standard VF-1 variable fighter with a smaller, simplified head unit and the capability to mount a customized FAST Pack system for use in space. The Shinnakasu Heavy Industry NP-BP-T1 FAST Pack space booster system offers the VT-1 the increased range and improved thrust typical of the unit, but the packs include no micro-missiles. The Ostrich FAST Packs include oversized dorsal propellant tanks, an additional antenna on the starboard booster pod, a wide-nozzle booster mounted on the tail section and swaps two low-thrust verniers for two additional high-maneuverability vernier thrusters.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/vt-1-ostrich.htm",
