  "description" : "Tokugawa Ieyasu is the father of Benitora and the daimyo of the Tokugawa clan. In the manga he is portrayed as a middle-aged man and a ruthless daimyo. He pretended to be Hattori Hanzo and used a double, a fat balding lieutenant of the Tokugawa clan, to play his role. Following the Shogun Tournament, he reveals himself to Kyou and the others. Later on in the story, he entrusts the Hokuraku Shimon to Benitora and helps Kyou defeat the former Crimson King.\nIn the anime, however, Ieyasu`s appearance is that of the double in the manga, and the Hattori Hanzo in the anime is the real Ieyasu himself in the manga. In the anime, Ieyasu is secretly being controlled by Santera, and eventually turns into a Kenyou which is killed by his son Hidetada.",
