  "description" : "Spheal is a spherical creature that rolls across ice floes because its body isn`t cut out for swimming. Spheal, in spite of its infancy, is fully capable of living in Arctic environments such as a tundra. Though it is not obvious, its body is fully covered in a layer of plushy fur that feels fluffy to the touch. This is surprisingly good at insulating Spheal against the cold when it is rolling about on ice floes or diving into the sea, for it apparently never feels the cold at all. When groups of Spheal eat, they instinctively show their pleasure by clapping and making other noises.",
