  "description" : "Tachibana Wataru is Nagi`s fianc√©e, but they have no feelings for each other; Wataru claims his parents arranged their future marriage entirely for the money. He lives and runs a video-rental store in the city, the last store owned by the Tachibana group which lost all their assets and is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the recession. His dreams is to make his store great and acquire a fortune greater than Nagi`s. Wataru is in love with Isumi. He first hates Hayate for accidentally stealing Isumi`s affection, but later he looks up to him and strives to be as good as he is. Regardless of that, he still calls Hayate by his own personal nickname for him, \"the Butler In Debt\" (or a variation thereof), and doesn`t hide his usual irritation.",
