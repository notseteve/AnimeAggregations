  "description" : "Zamazenta is a Fighting-type Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, it has a second form activated by giving Zamazenta a Rusted Shield to hold. Its original form, Hero of Many Battles, will then become the Fighting/Steel-type Crowned Shield.\nZamazenta is the game mascot of Pokémon Shield, appearing on the boxart.\nBy absorbing the metal particles, Zamazenta can change to its other form in battle. In legends, it known as the Fighting Master`s Shield due to ability to defect any attacks. Zamazenta is both feared and respected by all. By becoming a statue, it can rest for aeons; even while asleep, it can cast illusions including a projection of itself. It is believed to be the younger sibling (or perhaps the rival) of Zacian. When together with Zacian, it cancels out the power of Eternatus, even in the powerful Eternamax form.\nZamazenta`s regal and majestic movements enables it to overwhelm opponents who face off against it. Zamazenta fends off the attacks of foes by using the golden shield that covers its front. The shield`s strength is so formidable that even the sharp claws of Dragon-type Pokémon cannot leave a single scratch upon it. No battlefield, no matter how terrible, can make Zamazenta flinch in its resolve. It charges at enemies head on with the impregnable shield-like armor that serves as a weapon. By bashing the enemies with its full might, it is said that the power can cause cracks in the land and that the resulting shockwaves can lay waist to hundreds of enemies. By using its signature move, it can go through towering mountains.\nZamazenta is the only known Pokémon capable of using Behemoth Bash.",
