  "description" : "Manufactured by Stonewell and Bellcom, the VF-X1 was the first non-variable fighter prototype to be flight-tested. Built as a flight-capable test bed and proof of concept, trial production began in early 2006. In February 2007, flight tests of the VF-X1 began and in November that year, the successful tests of the VF-X1 lead to formal adoption of the Valkyrie variable fighter by the United Nations Government.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/vf-x.htm",
