  "description" : "Nick Hillman is a scientist who Hei meets as he infiltrates PANDORA. Nick and Hei become friends and both have a fascination with the \"real sky\". Nick turns out to be a contractor and is revealed to have the ability to manipulate electricity, apparently the same as Hei`s ability. His remuneration is putting people`s shoes on the ground upside-down next to each other. He became close to Hei, thinking that they were both alike, not just in their abilities, but even their dream of wanting to see the real starry sky. He felt that of all the people, he didn`t want Hei to know he was a contractor and to get him involved. After he and Hei battle for the artifact known as the \"meteor fragment\" Nick disappears as soon as the artifact is activated. Apparently, the meteor fragment reacted with Hei and allowed him to make Nick`s \"dream\" come true, which is to have a rocket (which looks very comical) to send both Nick (who became a young boy in his dream) and his sister to space. Nick`s ability to have an ambition is a mystery even to himself since contractors shouldn`t have emotion.",
