  "description" : "Algol was a Silver Saint sent to destroy the Colosseum that the \"Galaxian Wars\" tournament took place in and kidnap Saori Kido. After Crow Jamian perished at the hands of Phoenix Ikki, Algol, Capella and Dante revealed themselves. The Phoenix Saint warned the other Bronze Saints that Algol was different from his friends, and Algol soon turned Andromeda Shun into stone with the Shield of Medusa, which could petrify opponents when it opened its eyes. Algol then battled with Dragon Shiryuu, but was outsmarted when the Dragon Saint blinded his eyes with his own fingers so that he could not see the Medusa Shield, as last resort to stop Algol and save the other Bronze Saints` lives. After a lengthy battle, Algol charged for a final attack, but was in the end defeated by Shiryuu, who heightened his Cosmo to \"see\" beyond his blindness.\nSource: Wikipedia",
