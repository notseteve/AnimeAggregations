  "description" : "Swablu has light and fluffy wings that are like cottony clouds. This Pok√©mon is not frightened of people. It lands on the heads of people and sits there like a cotton-fluff hat. It loves to make things clean and to this end, if it spots anything dirty, it will wipe and polish it with its cottony wings. If these wings become dirty, it will find a stream to shower itself. After enduring winter, in which little food is available, Swablu flocks move closer to towns in the spring.",
