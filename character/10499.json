  "description" : "Libra Douko is the Libra Gold Saint in Lost Canvas. He shows signs of slight rashness and immaturity, and has big respect for his partners, turning pretty furious if they are in danger. However, in these occasions, he does not quite concern about consequences. He is a good friend of Aries Shion and Taurus Aldebaran to whom he often talks to and sometimes say his way of thinking is thanks to them.",
