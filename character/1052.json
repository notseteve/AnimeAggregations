  "description" : "Cradily has been extinct for 100 million years before the series. It is brought back to life as a Lileep restored from fossils. Cradily is an aquatic creature that makes its nest in the shallows of warm seas. For this reason, when the tide goes out, Cradily can be seen on what are now wet beaches. In a particularly turbulent area of the sea shore, Cradily anchors itself to the sea floor with its heavy, particularly shaped lower body so as to prevent itself from being washed out to sea.\nWhen hunting marine creatures, Cradily makes its way deeper into the ocean, dragging its heavy body along as its body`s anchor-like composition prevents Cradily from floating off the sea floor and to the surface. When Cradily spots its prey, it extends its trunk-like neck and its eight tentacles to ensnare its target, where it uses powerful acid secreted in its tentacles to melt the prey before feeding.",
