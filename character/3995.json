  "description" : "He is the guitarist of Blast and was the only person able to befriend Nana Osaki during high school--which coincidentally began their shared love for punk music. He is friendly and optimistic, but at times, he tends to miss the focus of conversations around him. Before Nana`s \"smoking ban\", he`s the only non-smoking member of Blast. However, his threshold for alcohol is poor and he accidentally leaks many secrets while he`s drunk (most notably, about Nana and Ren`s relationship to Shin). Like Yasu, Nobu comes from a rich family (his parents own an inn). Despite this, he is still very passionate about music, even sharing Osaki`s dream of making it big with a band one day.",
