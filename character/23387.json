  "description" : "Meister Otome (Lofty Crimson Jade/Blue Sky Sapphire) and mother of Arika Yumemiya. Uses the alias \"Rena Yumemiya\". She bears a HIME-like mark on her chest, which makes her a true HIME, so she has manifested a true child and element Artemis. Plus she is a family member of the Searrs Family, what gives Miyu reason to protect her as inheriter of Alyssa`s bloodline. She has manifested a set of golden wings, similar to Miyu`s visions of her ancestor, Alyssa Searrs. She has broken more than one gem due to power overload.",
