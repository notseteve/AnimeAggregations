  "description" : "Lizlet L Chelsie works in a tea café as a waitress. She is a tsukumogami, an inanimate object that came to life after a hundred years. She has the appearance of a busty young girl with maid outfit, but her true body is an antique tea cup that the tea café`s owner bought in England. When she meets Yuuto at her workplace, she believed that he was some kind of exorcist, and that he was trying to kill her, so, in a panic, she added poison into Yuuto`s tea. The plan was foiled by Shizuku. Himari then attacks her and she was soon able to find Liz`s real body, and as Liz was trying to get it back, Himari dropped it, but Yuuto was able to catch it and save Liz. After the misunderstanding was cleared, Liz began taking a liking to Yuuto and sees him as her Special Customer. She also has a strong desire to serve him a cup of Milk Tea, where every time she says so she hugs her breasts, suggesting she means her breast milk. Chapter 27.5 shows that whatever the teacup feels so does Lizlet shown when Himari rubs and licks it.",
