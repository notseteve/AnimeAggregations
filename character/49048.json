  "description" : "Already largely organic in appearance, the film version of the Queadluun-Rau underwent only a subtle redsign from the television series. The most notable difference was the change in colors, utlizing the Meltrandi magenta fleet colors for the standard version while http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia]`s unit was colored red (perhaps a subtle historical allegory to Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron of World War I). Aside from the different colors and slight stylistic changes, the Queadluun-Rau was just as deadly in the movie.\nFollowing the Great Interstellar War (Space War I), the Queadluun-Rau units were employed by the U.N. Forces. Unfortunately, breakdowns in production at the Factory Satellite caused a gradual decrease in operational units. Operational rates were reduced such that by the 2030s the Queadluun-Rau could not be supported by available spare parts. Fortunately, support for reproduction of the Queadluun-Rau remained strong. In 2035, variable fighter design and manufacturing company General Galaxy was entrusted by the U.N. Forces with a modernization and reproduction plan for the Queadluun-Rau.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/queadluun-rau-dyrl.htm",
