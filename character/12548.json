  "description" : "She`s the only daughter of the Asagiri household. When she was young, her parents gave her a piano as a present. She was very happy about it but it did not last when they started hating each other. They part ways and left her with Ms. Ono, her guardian. Ms. Ono has replaced Reiko`s parents. She is the one who always supervised her piano practice. Reiko, with the hopes of bringing her parents together, plays the piano. It`s a sad thing when they did not attend her first piano recital.\nEvery child has his/her own fantasy. Reiko always dreamed about becoming a good witch, similar to the one that granted Cinderella`s dream. Some children outgrow their childhood fantasies, but she is different. She always wanted to be helpful and useful to everyone, like the good witch. When her power awakened (the Gate of Illusion), she did not think twice in joining the Gate Keepers, because for her, her power is similar to a good witch`s magic.",
