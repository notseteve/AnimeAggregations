She is also the girlfriend of http://anidb.net/ch64309 [Saeki], though http://anidb.net/ch64309 [Saeki] is taller than her. She is from a wealthy family and owns multiple well-bred dogs.\nMuch like most of Akira`s party, she gets abducted by http://anidb.net/ch60801 [Maya], who turns her into her plaything and names her \"Ojou-sama\". Later, Akira rescues her, only to witness the brutal rape of her girlfriend by Maya`s henchmen. During the second episode, she almost immediately disappears but is shown dead in the end.\nShe has fair skin, short black hair, yellow eyes, and she wears a frilled purple gown decorated with a ribbon. Later, this gown is taken from her by Maya.",
