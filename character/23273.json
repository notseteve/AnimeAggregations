  "description" : "A girl that really likes riding bicycles, and is quite energetic, though a little crude. If you stick around her, she`s surprisingly cautious. Very helpful. A little too familiar with things, but doesn`t dig too deep. Not quite comfortable with having other people help her. For that reason, she spends as little time as possible. Her personality drastically changes when it comes to her own interests. Proactive. Has a habit of using strange and difficult vocabulary at times, but somehow you can tell she`s purposely doing so. Ended up hanging out with the Future Gadget Laboratory since she started working at the CRT TV Workshop.",
