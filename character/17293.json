  "description" : "Apos is the primary antagonist of the series. As revealed in episode five, Apos is a hermaphrodite possessing qualities of both an angel and an immortal, which, according to him, makes him a \"god\". He seems to have no concept of human morals but instead, has a sadistic sense of amusement and beauty. In the early episodes, Apos demonstrates interest in http://anidb.net/ch16960 [Rin], to the point that he hires mortal killers to target her. In episode three, he reveals that he is after Rin`s time spore. Apparently, time spores contain the immortals` memories and Apos enjoys consuming them. It is also revealed that he has the ability to instantly remove the spores from both immortals and angels (thus killing them). Anyone else wishing to kill an immortal must physically dig through their victim`s flesh for the time spore. In episode six, Apos is revealed to be the child of Tajimamori, the previous Guardian of Yggdrasil, and the current Guardian himself. Guardians are supposed to switch every once in a (long) while, but Apos desires to become a permanent guardian by sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil.",
