  "description" : "Nana in her original form, and the one form that remains even when the other parts of her personality split from her. Shy and very timid, and for as long as she can remember she has had a crush on a boy in her class called Yuichi, and yet has been scared to approach him and tell him how she feels. This has led to three girls, that actually turn out to be her friends as the story progresses, to tease and torment her as they try to vie for Yuichi`s attention. She is also the only Nana to be called only \"Nana\". Her color is Blue.",
