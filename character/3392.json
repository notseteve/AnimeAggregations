  "description" : "Nanami Ao is a fifteen years old female Satori who helps run the office and is the announcer of the town as well. She has cat ears, which she usually hides with a hat or headphones, and has the ability to read people`s thoughts. She can talk to animals using this ability as well. She has a stronger version called Satellite, which can read the thoughts of everyone in the city at once, though this drains a lot of her energy.\nSource: Wikipedia",
