  "description" : "Cascoon is a cocoon Pokémon form that Wurmple can take. It can be considered a modern counterpart to earlier cocoon Pokémon species Metapod and Kakuna, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Silcoon, an alternative cocoon form that Wurmple can take instead at random. Cascoon is a semi-mobile ellipsoid ball of purple silk where the eyes of the mutating Pokémon inside are visible looking out. It hides away from predators in the wild using the more crafty method of covering its body with large, dead leaves. Its initially soft body hardens over time and begins to crack when it nears evolution into Dustox, and at this point it will do nothing in order to conserve its energy, even if it is attacked.\nIn the Pokémon anime, trainer Jessie `s Wurmple evolves into the Cascoon stage and then the Dustox stage shortly after, as opposed to May`s Wurmple becoming a Silcoon and then a Beautifly.",
