  "description" : "Louden is the director of the Kojin Town aquarium. He knows everything about the area and has plenty of interesting stories to tell people that visit.\nHe told this story about the reason for the Gold Koiking statue: Long ago, free-dive fishing was popular in this area. Once, a fisherman was attacked with electricity by a Starmie while freediving and came on the verge of drowning. But just then, a huge, golden Koiking brought the fisherman to the shore, saving his life. Not only that, but there are occasionally some reports of the golden Koiking being seen.\nWhen Louden told the mayor about it, that meddler went right ahead and had that statue built at the aquarium. Louden`s dream is to bring the real golden Koiking to the aquarium and show it to children from all around the country.\nHe spends many hours a day fishing to try to get the golden Koiking. On the evening Ash Ketchum and his friends were leaving, they saw the golden Koiking, finally confirming its existence. Louden told them he`d be sure to get the golden Koiking by their next visit to the aquarium.",
