  "description" : "Mamoru Sakimori, better known as Captain Bravo in the series is Tokiko`s commander, who dresses in an outfit that covers every inch of his body except for his eyes. Though Tokiko assumed this was to protect his identity, Bravo actually has no qualms with showing his real appearance when he acts as Kazuki`s dorm supervisor. He claims that he does not use his real name because it is cooler that way. The truth is he abandoned the name after his first and last mission in the \"Showusei Team\", who only managed to save Tokiko. He acts as a father figure for Tokiko, after rescuing her as a child; then Kazuki, who trains him \"without mercy\" when Kazuki becomes a full Alchemist Warrior (both he and Kazuki claim to be \"Masters of Special Training\", Kazuki at receiving and Bravo at giving). He is the only character besides Kazuki who loves green vegetable juice. During the Muto Assassination arc, he tried to kill Kazuki but he later defends Kazuki when Kazuki defeats him. He was critically injured by Hiwatari when he gave up his silver skin to cover up Kazuki and Tokiko from getting killed by Hiwatari`s Blaze of Glory. Bravo remained conscious and controlled Silver Skin to prevent both Hiwatari and Kazuki from harming each other till Showusei appeared and stopped both raging warriors. True to his name, the captain has a tendency to say \"Bravo\" when applauding someone. He claims that he has 13 different attacks regardless of identity, such as Comet-Bravo Kick, and Charming-Bravo Kiss.",
