  "description" : "Guren S.E.I.T.E.N. Eight Elements uses the energy wing system similar to that of the Lancelot Albion, but with four energy \"feathers\" instead of three. The wings can also serve as cutting weapons. The system allows the Guren to move at blinding speeds, such that it appears to be little more than a purple blur in flight.\nIts radiant wave surger arm has gold highlights on the fingers and forearm, and has been upgraded significantly. It can be fired like a Slash Harken, and has a Harken Booster for controlled flight. The arm still functions when launched as such. Its original functions are retained and far more potent: the ordinary radiation burst can block a Hadron Cannon blast with seemingly no effort and the hand can crush energy shielding without the aid of the emitter. It is also capable of firing disk-like radiation projectile. The Guren`s fork knife is also upgraded, having been retrofitted with MVS capability and made about twice as long. Its MVS (which is colored purple as opposed to the usual red) is evidently more potent than normal versions, as it can cut through the Lancelot Conquista`s MVS swords.\nThe Guren S.E.I.T.E.N. Eight Elements-Type\nAdditional armor is also present on the knees and ankles. The antennae have been extended and enlarged, making them appear to be giant ears. Its chest is completely different, with the orange part extended further and a pair of green jewels featured prominently on the front. Its namesake comes from its operation system, which is Superlative Extruder Interlocked Technology Exclusive Nexus (S.E.I.T.E.N.) Eight Elements. It also is equipped with two Slash Harkens attached to it`s shoulders.",
