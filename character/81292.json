  "description" : "Katsuki Yuuri is a 23-year-old figure skater who is faint-hearted and gains weight easily. He`s the \"figure skater with the world`s biggest glass heart\". His favourite dish is a 900kcal breaded pork cutlet bowl. His greatest skating assets are his peculiar sense of rhythm and unique step. However, he is weak to pressure and messes up at crucial moments. He`s at a crucial point in his career, and he bets everything on one last skating season.\nSource: ANN",
