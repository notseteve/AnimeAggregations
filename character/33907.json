  "description" : "Souga Kazukiyo is the Class President of 1-A, who suffers from nyctophobia (severe fear of the dark) and a fear of just about anything that is scary. He has romantic feelings for Class 1-A`s Vice-President Momoka, whom he has known for years, but he is initially too shy to say anything. Hikaru and Kaoru comment that he is the kind of person with pure feelings who they cannot tease, possibly because he is more emotionally vulnerable than Tamaki. In the manga, he unwittingly caused Haruhi trouble with her scholarship when he ranked as the top student of his grade.",
