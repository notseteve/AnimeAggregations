  "description" : "A girl who focuses all of her energy on living honestly and being an active benefit to the community in hopes that others would see her as a responsible and dependable person. Despite this, the well-known fact that her mother is a prostitute and her humourless, over-responsible attitude leaves her with no friends. Ever since elementary school any kind of hatred or dishonesty tortures her, so much that she can`t even raise a clenched fist at all of the kids who bully her, constantly having to keep to her duty and not protest in the slightest. Regardless, she looks up to her mother, and hopes to be able to stand proudly like she does. Nakama would even go so far as to give her mother the money she makes doing needlework. It was her mother`s idea that she go to the nature school so that she would finally make some friends.",
