  "description" : "Dr. Kabuto Juuzou is Kenzou`s father and grandfather to both Kouji and Shirou. He was a previous colleague of Dr. Hell`s and created Mazinger Z in order to oppose Hell`s plans for world domination. Hell sent Baron Ashura to kill Juuzou before he could present a threat, and he was fatally injured in the attack, but survived long enough to tell Kouji about Mazinger Z and how it must be used to defeat Dr. Hell.\nIn the Mazinkaiser OVA, Kabuto Juuzou was retconned into surviving without Kouji or anyone`s knowledge, and worked in another secret underground laboratory where he finished the final and more powerful version of Great Mazinger and then his ultimate creation, Mazinkaiser. He later appeared to Kouji via hologram, telling him about Mazinkaiser. Whether he was still alive, and if so, where he currently was, is unknown.\nNote that, in the original manga and the Mazinkaiser OVA, Kabuto Juuzou presents several physical scars (more exactly, half his face is burned) and is more hot-tempered and even slightly megalomaniac. His TV series rendition is lots more calmer and stable, and also has a rather normal outlook. His Shin Mazinger incarnation however seems to be every bit as megalomaniacal as the manga version.",
