  "description" : "The Skull Knight is an enigmatic figure and a self-proclaimed foe of the inhumans, having waged war against demonkind for a millennium.\nAn ancient being, the Skull Knight is aloof and mysterious with great understanding of the deterministic nature of the world and foreknowledge of the predestined. As such, he possesses a brutally realistic worldview, oftentimes citing the inevitability of causality`s flow. Despite this outlook, he has proven to be quite heroic, saving http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] and his comrades on multiple occasions. However, http://anidb.net/ch87815 [Flora] has questioned whether his actions are out of genuine care or merely a means of furthering his own agenda, a query which the Skull Knight turns a deaf ear to. He ultimately values the human will to survive and defy fate, encouraging Guts to contend against causality and aptly naming him \"struggler\". He is also quite insightful, warning Guts that http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca]`s true desire might differ from the Black Swordsman`s own.\nThe Skull Knight has a long-spanning rivalry with Nosferatu http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], who is always excited to fight the knight, calling him \"old friend\". He is normally indifferent to Zodd, only showing irritation at the apostle`s efforts to impede him, though he does openly acknowledge their history and rivalry. He has also known and apparently had a close relationship with the witch Flora for at least several hundred years.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
