  "description" : "Barnette Orangello is one of the many Dread pilot co-leaders under Meia`s command on the Nirvana, and is ranked higher than Dita. Unlike the three other Dread pilots featured in the series (Dita, Meia, and Jura), her Dread cannot combine with Hibiki`s Vanguard, due to her position when the Paksis altered the Dreads. She displays one of the most aggressive behaviours, in terms of both her fighting style and her attitude towards men, who have been integrated into the Nirvana`s crew (probably more so than Meia). She has a very impressive firearms collection (including a Calico pistol, a CZ 75 pistol, a Steyr AUG, and a Franchi SPAS-12 Shotgun) and is also an excellent cook. During the Second Stage, she voluntarily replaced Gascogne to lead the Registry, after a sortie against a Harvester mothership.\nIn the anime, she has a romantic relationship with Jura Basil Elden. In the manga, Barnette has feelings for Hibiki.",
