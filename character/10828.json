  "description" : "Himegami was http://anidb.net/ch528 [Nagi]`s butler before http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate]. He has yet to make an appearance in the manga, but judging from the way Nagi and http://anidb.net/ch529 [Maria] speak of him, he quit due to a problem related to Nagi`s personality traits. Neither Nagi nor Maria seem to want to elaborate on his departure. Also with references from the first volume he was close to Nagi. He wrote a book on how a butler can acquire a one-hit kill technique, but later Nagi burnt the book. Maria addresses him with the title \"-kun\", which means he is probably around Hayate and Maria`s age. In episode 34 of the anime, he makes his appearance, but with his face obscured by the shadows. He returns once more in episode 38 wearing a mask. In episode 39 his face is shown. In the anime, it is stated he was fired from his position rather than him personally resigning, and it is implied that it is partially because he always hit Nagi back after she would hit him. He also insists that he be called \"Princess God\" (in English) rather than Himegami, which is a direct translation of his surname.",
