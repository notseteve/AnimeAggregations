  "description" : "The gunturtle is a self-propulsion robotic soldier officially adopted by the Space Federation Force into its land war force.\nWhen it is moving, it is a 50 centimeter diameter mobile ball, when in combat, transforms to a full length of 150 centimeters, and it attacks while flying one to two meters in height via high powered blusters.\nIn order to manipulate the self-propulsion robotic soldier, a portable control console (something like a small laptop) is necessary, and the robot moves according to a simple program transmitted through the console. The program is modifiable as the occasion calls for it, but because the gunturtle can only execute simple basic movements and rules, the program changes depending on enemy movements. How the basic program is constructed to deal with complex situations and engage in combat is what defines a superior gunturtle user.\nIt is armed with one cannon of 20 millimeter rounds and two phaser machine guns.\nIt can fire up to a hundred 20 millimeter rounds and up to a thousand charges in each phaser machine gun. The phaser machine gun has power of an average 7.92 millimeter machine gun.\nsource: official website`s character page, translated by lf412",
