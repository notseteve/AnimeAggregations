  "description" : "Golbat are a larger, stronger, and more developed form that Zubat take on when they gain enough experience. In the main Pokemon game series, a Golbat is acquired when a Zubat grows past experience level 22 and is evolved into a Golbat. Golbat are found in some cave areas.\nGolbat is a fierce, nocturnal Pok√©mon, residing in the darkness of caves, and is most active in the pitch black of night, especially if the moon is in its new phase. It is widely known and despised for its feeding behavior: Sucking fresh blood from living things in large quantities. Once it has found a living target, it attacks in a stealthy manner, often striking without warning from behind, to harshly bite down on its prey with its four sharp fangs strong enough to puncture the hide of any animal-like Pokemon, however strong the hide might be. It then proceeds to drink ten ounces of blood instantly. Golbat enjoys blood so much that it does not want to stop, even though a lot of blood will weigh it down enough so that, if it is able to even fly afterwards, it flies clumsily.\nSurprisingly, after each attack and feeding sequence, Golbat`s own blood type changes into that of its victim. Once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy from the victim even if it gets too heavy to fly. Like Zubat, the female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.",
