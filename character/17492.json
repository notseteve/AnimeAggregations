  "description" : "His night (youkai) form is confident, strong and inspires \"Fear\" amongst his allies leading many to join him. He decides to leave the human side of things to his \"Day\" form and handle the youkai-side of things. After losing to his grandfather, he is taken to the youkai village to train and finally learns what type of demon he is and how to gain his Fear abilities. He has departed for Kyoto to face Hagoromo Gitsune to save Yura and avenge his father. He is currently undergoing a 3-day training with Gyuuki to surpass \"Himself\" after losing to Tsuchigumo. He seems to get stronger when his \"Day\" and \"Night\" blood mix. But now it seems as though night Rikuo and day Rikuo are one being and are not a split personality. His primary weapon is the Spirit Blade Nenekirimaru, which was designed to only harm youkai.",
