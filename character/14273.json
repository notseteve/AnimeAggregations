  "description" : "Little is known about Alfred, except he seems to be the head of the Neo-Nazi underworld. He is an elderly man, most likely in his 80s, since he was in the SS during the war, and it is implied that he is a combat veteran. Sir Alfred sets up a test of loyalty and ability for http://anidb.net/ch14270 [Rachmann] and his http://anidb.net/ch14274 [Aryan Socialist Union], in which he purposely sends them to face-off with the Lagoon Company. Even though he sets them up, he already knows that Rachmann will most likely be defeated. Rachmann and the Lagoon Company are unaware that they are being set up. Sir Alfred feels that Rachmann and his men are idiots and a disgrace to call themselves Nazis, seeing their easy defeat by a group of \"racially inferior\" members as proof of their incompetence in his view. He even thanks Dutch and Revy for killing them off for him, and even harbours an amount of respect for Dutch, despite being a black man. Before killing Rachmann, Dutch figures out that the Spanishman who hired him was in fact The Boss setting him up. In the manga, he is referred to as \"Sir Alfred\".",
