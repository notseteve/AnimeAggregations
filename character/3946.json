  "description" : "* Ability: Change his fighting will into power (never used)\nLi Ho considers Ueki his rival and wants to become a strong fighter in honor of his father, who fell victim to the plague. Originally, he fights Ueki using a move he calls the Secret of the Count of Monte Cristo (秘鍵巌窟王, hiken gankutsuou) but succumbs to its weakness when Ueki grabs hold of his shoulders. He covers this weakness in Round 4 by rotating his arms and shoulders, but his technique fails once again when Anon grips onto his head to stop his movement.\nDuring the third round, Li Ho displays a distinct growth in power, utilizing his inner power to perform powerful attacks. Channeling his power into his feet, for instance, allows him rapid movement.\nLi Ho has developed a defense called Tai Chi Chuan which is a circular strike used to repel any attack. Ueki battles him before facing Marylin, and learns new ways to use his powers and skills in battle.",
