  "description" : "Fegan was an alliance captain in command of the Grand Canal. Part of a force of 10 cruisers and destroyers escorting Alliance merchantmen, he elected to stay back and defend the convoy when the rest of the force abandoned the mission taking advantage of an ambiguous directive from Lasalle Lobos. Outnumbered in an Imperial attack, he sacrificed himself and his ship to allow the merchant ships to escape.\nCapt. Fegan is based on the real life Capt. Edward Fegen of HMS Jervis Bay, who was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for a similar rearguard action protecting Convoy HX 84 during World War II.",
