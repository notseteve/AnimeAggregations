  "description" : "Vrlitwhai Kridanik is a Zentradi fleet commander in charge of his own fleet under the http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet. As a commander type Zentradi he is much larger and stronger than the normal Zentradi soldier and can even survive in the vacuum of space for limited periods of time, allowing him to go toe to toe with a Battroid.\nThe Vrlitwhai fleet was pursuing surviving Supervision Army ships when they stumbled on Earth and the rebuilt http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]. When the booby trap system in the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] fired on Vrlitwhai`s recon team it started Space War I. The fact that the humans possessed reaction weaponry (nuclear devices) — a technology the Zentradi have lost — and that the humans were \"miclone\" roused Vrlitwhai`s curiosity and made him pursue the Macross personally and relentlessly, even as his orders changed with every new revelation concerning the Humans. Because of his long exposure to human culture, he was one of the early defectors to the human side, helping in ending the war in the battle of February 11, 2010. In the aftermath of Space War I, he also helped capture a Zentradi factory satellite for the new United Nations in October 2011.\nYears after the war was over and peace was signed, the new U.N. assigned him as commander of the New U.N.
