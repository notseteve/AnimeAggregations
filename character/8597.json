  "description" : "Deidara is a former ninja of http://anidb.net/ch12200 [Iwagakure], and was also a terrorist bomber-for-hire before http://anidb.net/ch7854 [Uchiha Itachi] forced him to join the http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki]. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara holds a grudge against Itachi and all Uchiha throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan eyes look down on his abilities. Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with http://anidb.net/ch7741 [Sasori], whom Deidara treats as his superior due to his artistic expertise. Sasori is replaced by http://anidb.net/ch8600 [Tobi] after his death, and Deidara assumes the master-position as Sasori had before him. Though he abuses Tobi when he annoys him, Deidara becomes more like a teacher to Tobi, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being. Each of Deidara`s hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create \"sculptures\" that are actually bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara`s bombs can take any form he chooses, and from the time of their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely. He is very confident in the ability of his explosives, and believes them to be unsurpassed. http://anidb.net/ch7719 [Uchiha Sasuke], Itachi`s younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a living bomb in an effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt.",
