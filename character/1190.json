  "description" : "Cherrim is the evolved form of Cherubi. During normal weather conditions, it appears as two crossing purple petals with a short purple stem, a green leafy sepal covering, and two deep pink feet. Similar to Castform and unlike Cherubi, however, Cherrim`s appearance changes to the cherry blossom form during sunny conditions. Though the bud form is quite docile, the flower form is much more cheerful.\nIn Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, its Flower Gift ability strengthens it and another Pokémon when it is sunny. Cherrim learns the existing attack Sunny Day to make the weather sunny, as well as a new attack called Lucky Chant, which prevents critical hits. Cherrim can also learn a new attack, Worry Seed, which temporarily changes the target`s ability to Insomnia.",
