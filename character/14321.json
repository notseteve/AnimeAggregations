  "description" : "Regiment leader, Fuyumi`s husband, and the sole survivor of Chise`s first platoon. He`s very much like Shuuji in terms of looks and personality and that`s why Chise is initially attracted by him. He treats Chise like an ordinary girl, not a monstrosity, and even goes shopping with her; this makes Chise like him even more and finds understanding and compassion in Tetsu.\nLater on, he gets injured during a fight and staggers to his quarters to hide, but four enemy soldiers were waiting for him and open fire. He dies shortly from his wounds, but manages to tell Chise that he loves her, mistaking her for Fuyumi. He`s one of the characters to be featured in the OVA, where Mizuki, his former commander, was shown to have a crush on him.",
