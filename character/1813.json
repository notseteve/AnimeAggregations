  "description" : "A Dai-Gunmen originating from the capital city, Teppelin. It is extremely bulky, and has a very uncomplicated humanoid shape.\nExtremely powerful, it was able to stop the Gurren-Lagann`s drilling power. On one arm it has a hand, whilst the other has a giant hammer, and it can deploy a vast amount of Gunmen. Like the Arc-Gurren-Lagann, it was designed to be piloted by a normal-sized Gunmen - in this instance, the Lazengann, with Lord Genome`s throne directly above it. It was stopped upon the defeat of the Spiral King, automatically shutting down and collapsed. After the seven-year timeskip, it is the capitol building for Kamina City. Half of its head was destroyed when the Anti-Spirals attacked. In Parallel Works 8, it is shown to be able to dock with Super Galaxy Gurren-Lagann in the same way as the Arc Gurren-Lagann did. Also, the tower on top of Dekatbutsu`s head was where the Lazengann docks with it. It can be assumed that, after Lazengann docked with Dekabutsu, the tower was constructed around it. The tower also provides a unique interface, allowing Lordgenome to control the entire Space Gunman without needing to be inside Lazengann. The Dekabutsu itself seems to project energy to all allied gunman, as normally beastmen piloted gunman are unable to function during the night (which they did during the battle of Tepplin) and the fact that all beastmen gunman shut down right after Lordgenome`s defeat.",
