  "description" : "Koizumi Akako is actually a witch with real magic, which causes her to be very critical of Kaitou`s \"sleight-of-hand\" magic. She knows that he is Kid, but has not told anyone. Akako is very much a seductress, and is \"trying to make every man her slave\". She is at first angry at Kaitou because she cannot \"control\" him, but later on she grows to love him. She seems to be able to summon Lucifer at will. She appeared in episode 219 and the first OVA of Detective Conan.\nHer attitude is like Haibara Ai of Detective Conan.\nShe originally belongs to Magic Kaitou (まじっく快斗), a manga series by http://anidb.net/cr474 [Aoyama Goushou], the creator of Meitantei Conan.",
