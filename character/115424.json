  "description" : "Zarude noticed Coco and he could not allow himself to leave the abandon child there, so he decided to disobey the law of the forest, leave his tribe behind, and live alone with the child, whom he named Coco. It has been 10 years since this Pokémon first started to raise this human when Coco meets Satoshi and Pikachu as they visit Okoya Forest.\nHe considers himself Coco`s father and Coco refers to him as Dad (とうちゃん). He was easier to identify between other Zarude as he wore a pink Celebi cape.",
