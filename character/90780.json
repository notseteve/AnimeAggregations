  "description" : "Keith Kazama Flick used to be a detective before his sister was murdered. He was called out of retirement by his old friend, http://anidb.net/ch90779 [Eric Toga], to help him track down the serial murderer known as http://anidb.net/ch90789 [Killer B].\nInitially, Keith gives the impression of a lazy genius, however he is able to accurately calculate and predict his target`s intentions and moves before taking an action. He is also skilled in math to the point that he is able to create portraits out of math formulas. He can also be obsessed such as when he filled his entire room with his equations.\nKeith is short-tempered and prefers his privacy. Even though he has a habit of running off by himself during a case, he knows when he needs help although he always has trouble asking for it.\nSource: B: The Beginning Wiki",
