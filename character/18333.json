  "description" : "\"Kotori-chan\" is Takanashi Souta in drag. The name `Kotori` derives from a more straightforward reading of `小鳥`, using the ordinary kun-yomi readings of the kanji rather than the variant nanori reading that becomes `Takanashi`. Despite his distaste for cross-dressing, Takanashi is convinced to do so when Inami`s father visits Wagnaria, and again during his date with her.\nTaneshima idolizes Kotori-chan as being the woman she aspires to be.",
