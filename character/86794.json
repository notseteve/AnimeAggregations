  "description" : "Solgaleo is a dual-type Psychic/Steel Legendary Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Cosmoem when leveled up in Pokémon Sun starting at level 53. It is one of Cosmog`s final forms, the other being Lunala.\nSolgaleo takes a special form called the Radiant Sun phase when it uses Sunsteel Strike.\nAlong with Lunala, it was initially revealed in May 2016, but officially revealed on June 2, 2016.\nSolgaleo is the game mascot of Pokémon Sun, appearing on the boxart.\nSolgaleo is a large, white Pokémon resembling a white lion. It has a blunt muzzle with a blue-gray nose and pale blue eyes. The top half of its face is a deep blue area that shows a constantly changing starscape. Four yellow spikes frame Solgaleo`s head like a crown and two more pairs of spikes adorn either side of its lower jaw, and each spike separates large tufts of Solgaleo`s mane. Solid ridges - red nearest Solgaleo`s head and yellow farther away - poke out of each tuft along the middle, except on the tufts on its cheeks and chin, with the topmost part wrapping around the tip of the tuft. Overall, its mane creates the impression of a stylized sun. Around each leg is a dark orange band, and there is a black spot on each foot. It has three black toes on each foot with long yellow claws. At the tip of its tail is a large black spot with a thin yellow rim.\nWhen Solgaleo enters its Radiant Sun phase, a light blue symbol appears on its forehead and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The fur on its body glows a pale yellow and all other parts of its body except its nose turn bright yellow.\nKnown as the \"beast that devours the sun,\" Solgaleo has long been honored as an emissary of the sun. Its body is capable of holding a vast amount of energy and glows when active. Solgaleo can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. Solgaleo along with its counterpart Lunala can create Cosmog.\nSolgaleo is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike.",
