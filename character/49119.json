  "description" : "The VC-079 is a civilian aerospace craft owned and operated by SNN, one of the major news agencies on Earth. The craft is designed to work in both the atmosphere and space with a special launch booster that enables the VC-079 to achieve orbit. The cockpit is very large and features a transparent canopy on both the top and bottom sections of the nose. Equipped with a limited transformation system the civilian valkyrie can angle the engines downward to act as legs for vertical take off and landing capability. http://anidb.net/ch35306 [Kanzaki Hibiki] piloted the VC-079 owned by SNN from their corporate headquarters when the Mardook attacked Earth in 2092. http://anidb.net/ch35306 [Hibiki]`s passenger was SNN reporter Dennis, who`s coverage of the war with the Mardook would tragically turn out to be his final assignment.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross2/vc-079-valkyrie.htm",
