During the start of the escape plan, he was expecting something exciting. Karasuba stated he`s never been wrong with his intuitions. He explanined to Minato why it is forbidden for Sekirei to attack an Ashikabi and what will happen if an Ashikabi dies (but knows that Haihane and Bentisubasa would attack an Ashikabi regardless of the consequences). He then tells Minato that if he were to kill him, it would elimate the whole Disciplinary Squad. Natsuo is a carefree person, and even his Sekirei say so. It is also stated by Haihane that he is homosexual.",
