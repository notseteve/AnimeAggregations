  "description" : "A blue-haired Zentradi female (Meltrandi) who is in command of the all-female S.M.S. Pixie Squadron, with the rank of captain. As a childhood friend of Michael Blanc, she actually harbours a crush on him that does not seem to be reciprocated until too late. She is also a top ace Queadluun-Reapower-armour pilot. Due to a certain genetic anomaly, she appears her age as a fully-developed Meltrandi while macronised, but becomes physically a juvenile in her micronised form. This makes her the perfect target for Michael`s mockery.",
