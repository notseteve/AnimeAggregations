  "description" : "The gruff and grizzled Revil is a high-ranking commander in the Earth Federation Forces, and the leader of some of the Federation`s most important counteroffensives against the Zeons. He takes a particular interest in the White Base and its crew, sending them supplies and experimental weapons through somewhat unorthodox channels. Whether he`s genuinely concerned for their welfare or simply observing how they perform under stress, Revil is nonetheless one of the White Base`s only sources of support.",
