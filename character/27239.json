  "description" : "Aloe`s Herderrier was revealed just before Ash`s rematch with her at the Shippo Gym. Aloe`s Herderrier is a completely different Pokémon all together from Aloe`s Yorterry. During Ash`s rematch battle with Aloe, Aloe`s Herderrier was matched up against Ash`s Tepig. Both Pokémon had become a lot stronger since their previous match-up and it showed during the battle. Roar once again proved to be an effective move causing Ash`s Tepig to be switched with Ash`s Oshawott but Aloe recalled her Harderrier right after the switch.\nAfter the draw battle between Ash`s Oshawott and Aloe`s Miruhog, Aloe`s Herderrier and Ash`s Tepig were matched up again but this time the winner of the battle would win the match. Aloe`s Herderrier used Giga Impact on Ash`s Tepig but it wasn`t enough to knock it out. Ash`s Tepig`s speed had increased because of the training with Don George and it was able to dodge most of Aloe`s Herderrier Shadow Ball`s. The match ended up being decided by a running charge of Aloe`s Herderrier`s Giga Impact against Ash`s Tepig`s Nitro Charge but Aloe`s Herderrier wasn`t able to withstand the attack giving Ash the match victory.",
