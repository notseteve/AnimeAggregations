  "description" : "Hidan is the immortal, foul-mouthed, and masochistic partner of http://anidb.net/ch7739 [Kakuzu] and a former ninja of http://anidb.net/ch12206 [Yugakure], the Village Hidden in the Steam. He is a member of the Jashin (ジャシン?, lit. \"evil god\") religion, a religion that worships a deity of the same name and where wreaking anything less than death and utter destruction in battle is considered a sin. His religion`s experimentations have led to the creation of his unique abilities; by consuming an opponent`s blood and then drawing Jashin`s triangular-design on the ground, Hidan can create a voodoo doll-like link with his opponent. Once this link is created, any damage done to Hidan`s body is reflected on his opponent, allowing him to kill them by giving himself fatal injuries. Because he is immortal, Hidan is not impaired while doing this, instead finding pleasure in the pain it causes him. After Hidan uses this ability to kill http://anidb.net/ch7742 [Sarutobi Asuma], http://anidb.net/ch8615 [Nara Shikamaru] fights him to avenge his teacher. Their battle culminates in Hidan being blown up, and Shikamaru burying his still-speaking remains in a place http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki] will never be able to reach. As such, Hidan is no longer considered a member by the rest of Akatsuki.",
