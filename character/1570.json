  "description" : "Never referred to as anything but Lunar`s Papa, he is Lunar`s father and leader of the Edomae group (in which whereas the Seto group`s holdings are in business, the Edomae group focuses in construction and real estate). He is two meters tall and constantly dressed in a black skintight suit. Lunar`s Papa is a man of very few words and is modeled after the Terminator. He is an extremely well built man, a point of humor in the show due to his body sounding like metal when hit. His actions are often direct references to the Terminator movies, such as sinking into an incinerator giving a thumbs up while even saying in English \"I`ll be back\". His appearance theme is a parody of the lead music score from the Terminator movie `Judgment Day`. Despite his cold and unemotional appearance, he cares very much for his daughter. He does everything he can for her, though discretely so. He is also extremely rich, as evidenced in one episode of using 1 billion dollars US (in cash) to keep the production of a film Lunar is acting in going. In the final episode, he is revealed to have laser eye beams. (wikipedia)",
