  "description" : "Gothitelle, known as the Astral Body Pokémon, resembles a stylized depiction of a lady wearing gothic lolita style clothing. It can see into the future by observing the stars` placement and movement. One of the things it looks for is the lifespan of Trainers.\nIGN described it as \"a lady centipede that is wearing an evening gown\". Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized Gothitelle, stating \"this isn`t even a Pokémon, it just looks like an indignant girl in a dress\".",
