  "description" : "Grayarts is an assassin and Cocovet`s Edel Raid pleasure. His mission is to kill Cou and capture Ren. However, he only knows their names and the color and shape of Ren after she reacts. This causes a problem because he suspects Kuea and Rowen. Rowen pretends to be Cou to find out what his mission is and manages to defeat him.\nIn the anime, both he and Cocovet were killed together.\nIn the manga Grayarts` arms were severed as punishment for failing his mission. He reappears after Gladius is beaten by the group. WIth arms apparently manifested by his new Edel Raid, he easily killed Gladius, as his new Edel Raid was light-attribute. He wears Cocovet`s Elemental Stone as a pendant.",
