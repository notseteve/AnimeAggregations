  "description" : "Nagasumi is the protagonist of the story. Nagasumi is likely the only one in his family who has a clear head, apart from his grandmother. When push comes to shove, Nagasumi demonstrates a great deal of inner strength. He decided to face his fears and take on the responsibility of taking care of Sun as his wife, although it doesn`t make it easy on him due to almost everyone in the Seto group (except Sun`s mother â€” Ren, and Masa) that are against their union. As the series progresses, however, he truly falls in love with Sun.",
