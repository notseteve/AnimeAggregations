  "description" : "Badr was the father of http://anidb.net/ch63160 [Sinbad] and a former soldier of the Parthevia Empire.\nBadr was a cheerful, fun-loving guy. He cared a lot about his family, just like how Sinbad cares for the people of his country like they were family. He had a serious side too, since when everybody in Parthevia was delirious with the war he asked himself if it was alright to continue like this. He and his son`s personalities are very similar.\nSource: Magi Wiki",
