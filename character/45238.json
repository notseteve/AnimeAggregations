  "description" : "Although the AMX-011 Zaku III design loses out to the AMX-014 Dooben-Wolf as Neo Zeon`s intended new frontline mass production mobile suit, several Zaku III prototypes are produced. These Zaku IIIs prove quite popular with many Neo Zeon officers and ace pilots fighting in the First Neo Zeon War. One Zaku III unit ends up in the hands of Haman Karn loyalist Mashymre Cello, who employs his customized Zaku III in one of the last battles of the war. Although Mashymre`s Zaku III is referred to as the AMX-011S Zaku III Custom, it`s indeed nothing more than the basic Zaku III loaded out with various optional equipment selected by Mashymre. His Zaku III Custom sports heavier and more stylized armor, a new head mounting a pair of vulcan guns, optional left shoulder armor with a hide bomb dispenser, a large backpack with powerful thrusters and ejectable external propellant tanks, and an enormous rear skirt armor plate.\nSource: mahq.net",
