  "description" : "Araya Souren is a former Buddhist monk who has lived for around 300 years and is an acquaintance of http://anidb.net/ch1887 [Aozaki Touko] from the time they studied at the Mage`s Association in London. Though he may be considered an average magus at face value, he is highly skilled in the creation of bounded fields. He carries a special bounded field that is divided into three layers, and absolutely anything that steps within range of the outer field is automatically frozen in place. It is mobile, something out of the ordinary since bounded fields are usually impossible to move, and Araya typically uses it as a weapon. Not only that, but the building that serves as his lair has become so much a part of him that it is almost like a reality marble, cementing him as an extremely powerful magus.",
