  "description" : "Anezaki Mamori is Sena`s overprotective and motherly childhood friend (actually, Mamori`s name is meant to be a pun, as her name means protect). Mamori`s mother met Sena`s mother in a cooking class, and Mamori and Sena have been friends ever since. Her mother is half-Japanese, half-American which makes Mamori 25% American and 75% Japanese. Mamori has been protecting Sena from bullies since primary school, to the point that Sena has grown up never having to stand up for himself.\nMamori joined the American Football club to watch over Sena and prevent any bullying by the other members (particularly Hiruma). Despite her `joining the American Football club just to protect Sena`s claim, she eventually becomes an excellent manager who knows the rules inside and out and makes up strategies for the team (since she has trouble with computers, she does it all on paperâ€”super-analog).",
