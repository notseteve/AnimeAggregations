  "description" : "Phione, known as the Sea Drifter Pokémon, is a Pokémon that can be obtained by breeding Manaphy and Ditto, though Phione will not evolve into Manaphy.\nIt is currently the only Pokémon that cannot evolve into the Pokémon from which it is bred, and it is the only Pokémon able to be bred from a legendary. Phione itself can breed with Ditto, but it will only produce other Phione and not a Manaphy. Because of Phione`s relation to Manaphy, there is evidence on both sides of the issue of Phione`s status (or lack thereof) as a legendary Pokémon. As it is the offspring of a legendary, and is banned from the Sinnoh Battle Tower, many people think it is a legendary. However, its lackluster stats and ability to breed more of itself lent evidence to the idea that Phione was not a legendary. Its legendary status was eventually confirmed by Pokemon.com. Many things that Manaphy has two of, Phione only has one of (Phione has one antenna, only one gem on its stomach, and has one \"eyelash\" coming from each eye, while Manaphy has two of these).\nSince it is the product of a bred Manaphy, they share many traits. It is the same shade of blue, it has the same large eyes, only blue, and has eyelash markings similar to Manaphy. It has a large knob-shaped bump on its head from which extends a long, ribbon-like antenna, somewhat resembling a sailor`s cap, though in fact it is a flotation device. Instead of feet, it has a small point, similar to Baltoy. Instead of two jewels, it has a single red gem in the middle of its tiny body. It has two large fins in proportion to its body, which it uses to navigate through the oceans that it lives in. While Manaphy is said to live in cold seas, it is said Phione live in warm seas.",
