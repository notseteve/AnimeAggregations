The dozen members of this supreme council serve as elected representatives of the twelve sectors, or \"cities,\" into which the PLANTs are grouped. The council itself meets at Aprilius One, the administrative capital of the PLANTs.\nEach member of the council is assigned to one of its five specialized committees - Administrative, Diplomatic, Judicial, Legislative, or National Defense. Each of these committees has its own chairman, and the overall council is chaired by a Supreme Council chairman. The council is also divided along political lines, with a roughly even split between radicals who seek to escalate the war, and moderates who hope to end the conflict through negotiation.",
