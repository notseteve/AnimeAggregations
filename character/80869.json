  "description" : "Kubota Yoshinobu is a student who was being bullied for money until http://anidb.net/ch79466 [Sakamoto] helped him get a part-time job at WcDonalds. Kubota managed to stand up for himself in dealing with the bullies, and now hangs out with Sakamoto.\nLike Sakamoto, he has `secret skills`, though they are all related to fast food. He cares for his hair so much, that when http://anidb.net/ch80861 [Hayabusa]`s underclassmen shaves all of his hair until he goes bald, he cries and stays in his room, not wanting to see anyone. He is also seen bringing hair care equipment to school.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
