  "description" : "Luis Sera was a scientific researcher who hailed from a rural, isolated mountain village in Southern Europe. A shameless self-professed ladies man, Luis was particularly interested in the study of parasites. After supposedly spending some time in Madrid he returned to his native village in the rural wilderness to find everyone infected by a strange parasite and the region under the rule of an ancient cult known as the `Los Illuminados`. Due to his background, the leader of the cult, Osmund Saddler, decided to recruit Luis to further the research rather than simply infect him.",
