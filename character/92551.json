  "description" : "Kiawe first encountered Marowak when it stole the Wela Crown during the Wela Fire Festival. It is said that when it is placed on a Pok√©mon`s head, it can become valiant and strong like Wela Volcano itself. Kiawe and Turtonator took up the task of retrieving the crown. Kiawe`s Turtonator was instrumental in battling Marowak but it lost the first match against because they were in a rush to get the crown back and Kiawe wasn`t paying proper attention to their opponent. He didn`t read Marowak`s actions and he just thought they could win as long as they unleashed a Z-Move but battling is all about watching their opponent closely and understanding them.\nAfter a training session with Ash and Pikachu, they challenged Marowak and were prepared this time. Shell Smash was a risky move to use in the battle but was used as a setup move in combination with Inferno Overdrive to knock out Marowak and win the rematch battle. They were able to return the Wela Crown after Marowak gave it up.\nKiawe`s Marowak took the crown and wore it because it wanted to grow stronger. The rematch battle made Kiawe realize that and also that its heart burns with passion, just like his does. Marowak is kind of obnoxious but it wanted to become a partner with Kiawe and it was caught willingly after the rematch battle.",
