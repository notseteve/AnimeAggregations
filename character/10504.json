  "description" : "Sakura is a second year junior high school student whose life changed the day the \"Bludgeoning Angel\" Dokuro-chan appeared. From that day on, he went from the life of a normal boy to one filled with bloody clubbings by said angel. In the future, Sakura is apparently destined to create a technology that stops girls from aging after they reach the age of twelve years, which has led to Sakura gaining a reputation as a pedophile around his school (though this is only because the male population are jealous of him having two heart-breakingly beautiful angels attracted to him). While not perverted by nature, Sakura still manages to get into tricky situations with Dokuro and later her sister. He has a crush on his classmate and friend Shizuki Minakami, though he is too afraid to tell her, but soon he develops feelings for Dokuro despite the way she treats him.",
