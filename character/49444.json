  "description" : "Hamaji is like a sister to http://anidb.net/ch49442 [Shino] and http://anidb.net/ch49443 [Sousuke], having been raised with them since childhood. Along with them, she survived the destruction of Otsuka Village. She is something of a health nut, and obsessed with making sure everyone around her maintains a proper diet, but her cooking skills leave a lot to be desired. Unlike her pretty appearance, she often manipulates Shino and Sousuke, but in heart, she cares about them.\nSource: ANN",
