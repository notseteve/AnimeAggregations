  "description" : "Orpherus is nicknamed \"Orphe\" by most of the people around him. He`s title Fürst is the highest of all characters and means a prince, but neither the anime nor the manga shows that he is really royalty and that`s because when it comes to royal and noble ranks in Germany the highest is Emperor (Kaiser). Despite all that, little is known about his house or his parents. All that is known is that they have a butler and that Orphe had a sister, named Robertine, who died when he was 15. Orphe was devastated after her death, and has the habit of caressing the pendant Robertine`s fiancé gave her and which Orphe took from the rubble of the explosion site. He blames himself for not accompanying her to buy the wedding dress, despite the fact that she insisted on going alone.\nOrphe is a very idealistic person. Isaac reprimands him on this, saying that he`s unconnected to today`s society and that words alone would not stifle the sparks of war. According to his way of thinking it can be said that he`s also a idealist. He likes politics and holds women in higher regards then most of the men in his time. He`s prone to winning and strives to excel in everything he does. He decided to become a Strahl candidate after meeting the king as a boy.\nSource: Wikipedia and Meine Liebe Manga",
