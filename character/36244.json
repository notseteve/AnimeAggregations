  "description" : "Priscilla S. Asagiri is the strongest member of the Knight Sabers, specializing in heavy assault. The vocalist of an underground rock band, she lives in the slums of the town in a trailer truck and is a distrustful loner who is rarely seen with her fellow Knight Sabers. She hates the AD Police because they broke her favorite CD when they destroyed a factory she lived in. AD Policeman Leon McNichol is attracted to her, but she initially mocks him. As the series progresses, her view changes and she falls in love with him. She also begins to become more friendly with her fellow team mates, though she always retains some distance with them and is very protective of her privacy.",
