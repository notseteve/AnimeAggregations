  "description" : "Gadved had been a good friend of Van and Helena, as both Helena and Gadved worked researching the Original Seven armors. On the tragic wedding day when Van and Helena was critically injured by the Claw, a dying Helena asked Gadved to permanently make Van \"Dann of Thursday\"`s pilot, thereby making him a member of the Original Seven. In the series, Van discovers to his enormous shock that Gadved has become one of the Claw`s followers. He also reveals that he was the one who told the Claw Man where to find Van`s wife. He is a veteran armor pilot and the last surviving member of the former generation of Original Seven pilots which he says had become corrupted, especially after the fall of the Mother Planet Earth. He is the first of the pilots to be killed by Van after they both agree to share the same dream, and the outcome of their battle was to prove who had the better conviction. In end, Van won out.\nArmor: Diablo of Monday resembles an axe.",
