  "description" : "Takara Yukari is Takara Miyuki`s mother, who tends to be very well-mannered, but can be a bit of a klutz. She is warm and friendly, once talking with a telemarketer for over an hour, and has a mischievous sense of humour. Yukari`s hair is short and unlike her daughter, she does not wear eyeglasses. She doesn`t like to do household chores, which explains why she isn`t very skilled with household items. On one occasion, she thought that a coloured candle was a popsicle. Yukari is often mistaken for Miyuki`s \"big sister\", rather than mother proper, due to her youthfully cuddly appearance, which combined with her adorably cheerful personality and endearing clumsiness, has resulted in her being regarded as moe, a trait not common for women in anime in their thirties.",
