She`s a werewolf with a very bright and outgoing personality and a druid capable of using healing magic, and often carries a massive staff to fight. While she appears to be sociable and friendly toward humans, it is only a mask to conceal her brutal and cunning personality.\nLupusregina is later assigned by http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz] to protect the inhabitants of Carne Village after he tames http://anidb.net/ch76773 [Hamsuke] (as her presence was the only thing keeping monsters away from there). However, when she fails to notify him about a threat to the village, believing it to be an unnecessary action, Ainz flies into a rage, terrifying all those around.\nSource: Wikipedia",
