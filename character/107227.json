  "description" : "Yamper is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII. It evolves into Boltund starting at level 25.\nYamper is a quadruped, canine Pokémon. It has a brown body with yellow fluff around its neck and yellow highlights around its eyes. It has a yellow bolt shaped tail and a heart shaped pattern on its rear. Its four feet are white.\nYamper tends to be drawn to fast moving things. It will chase after people, Pokémon, or even vehicles. Yamper has an organ that generates electricity from the base of its tail when it runs. Yamper cannot store the electricity it generates, so sparks of electricity can often be seen when it is running. It is a popular choice in the Galar region for herding Pokémon such as Wooloo. Due to its gluttonous nature, it will only assist people in exchange for treats. Joltik are often seen on its hindquarters, feeding on its static electricity.",
