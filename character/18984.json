  "description" : "The team leader and field commander of XAT. Wolf is an imposing and powerfully built man with dark skin, who is usually very strict and often at odds with Hermann`s rebellious nature. He was wounded during the transportation of Gerd`s infected girlfriend Jil Hoffman, after he fought her with a taser when she awoke as an Amalgam. From then on he began to show strange symptoms of illness that Beatrice confirmed to be signs of him changing into an Amalgam. Seduced and committed to Xargin`s cause, he infected most of his subordinates with his mere presence, hoping they would remain at his side when they turned to Amalgams as well. This showed that, nevertheless, Wolf was still bound by some sort of friendship toward them, as he was distraught after mortally wounded Al and Brad in self-defence. After the destruction of XAT he tried to revive Al, Brad, and Lena with his blood, but succeeded only in reviving Al. He continued to direct his task force from there on, albeit as a human-hunting one. He fought against Amanda and a Demoniac-turned Hermann while counting on Al`s help, but was fooled and killed when Al regained his memories and blew most of his head off. He later appears with the other deceased characters with an apologetic look, asking Amanda for forgiveness.\nWolf`s Demoniac form is an enormous, powerful humanoid with gorilla-like features and a horned head shaped like a skull. Though slower than most Amalgams he`s immensely strong and resilient, using his tank-like armour to fend off most attacks bare-handed. He can also elongate his arms, rocket-punching his enemies with extreme strength.",
