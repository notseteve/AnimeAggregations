It appears that Hirooumi and http://anidb.net/ch50835 [Akihito] had something happen between them in the past, but now they are on such good terms that they can joke around with each other. He has a big sister complex. Due to his barrier powers as an underworlder, he is extremely sensitive to cold, and is almost always seen wearing a muffler or scarf. Hiroomi is a third-year student in high school.\nSource: ANN",
