  "description" : "Anton Hilmer von Schaft was an Imperial admiral who served under http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] as the head of the Science And Technology Division, holding that post since around 792 UC. That made him one of the few high ranking officials from the Goldenbaum Dynasty that were able to keep their post after the Lippstadt War. Under the covert direction of http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Phezzan] he produced and implemented a plan to mobilize http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersburg Fortress], which led ultimately to the Eighth Battle of http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn].\nHe was subsequently arrested on charges of corruption, embezzlement of public funds, tax evasion, and betrayal of military secrets. The evidence for it was given to the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Empire] by http://anidb.net/ch217 [Rupert Kessellink], on http://anidb.net/ch204 [Adrian Rubinsky]`s orders, as Schaft was no longer useful to them in the aftermath of the Imperial defeat at the Eighth Battle of Iserlohn.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
