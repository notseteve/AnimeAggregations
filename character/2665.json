  "description" : "After graduating from the Federation`s military academy, this young officer is stationed at the Torrington base in Australia as a test pilot - an assignment which amounts to little more than serving as a moving target in combat simulations. But when enemy ace Anavel Gato steals the Gundam GP02A from the Torrington base, Kou attempts to stop him with the prototype Gundam GP01, and demonstrates a natural talent as a pilot. As a result, he`s assigned to the carrier Albion as it takes off in pursuit of the stolen Gundam. Initially naive, inexperienced, and socially inept, Kou begins to mature through his relationship with Nina and his wrenching experiences in battle.",
