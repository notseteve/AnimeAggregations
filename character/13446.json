  "description" : "Saiko Yuki (inspired by manga author http://anidb.net/cr1021 [Asamiya Kia]`s favourite actress http://anidb.net/cr13769 [Saitou Yuki], and also a play on \"Psycho Yuki\") is the http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP]`s mascot, dispatch officer and http://anidb.net/ch13447 [Lebia]`s data processing assistant. Although Yuki sometimes acts a little air-headed (she`s only a teenager), she can show a great deal of courage when needed.\nYuki runs a small coffee shop called http://anidb.net/e12405 [Labyrinth], but it is more a hobby than a business since she is a full-time police officer. However, the lease stipulates that as long as she runs it, she doesn`t have to pay rent.\nAs child, she was found by http://anidb.net/ch13449 [Rally Cheyenne] in the street crying and was later recruited for her enormous psychic powers. Her ability of precognition qualifies her for being a tactical advisor for other team members in battle. For Yuki`s origin see her childhood version http://anidb.net/ch25799 [Yuki-chan]; her character background in the http://anidb.net/a2638 [second movie] differs from the TV version as in the movie she`s not an AMP member yet when http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Katsumi] meets the AMP for the first time.\nShe met her love interest, http://anidb.net/ch25803 [Washio Tooru] in 1997 as a result of an encounter with a http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawk] and a magical coffee mill. Both were 17 at the time and she was 16. They met again after Yuki returned to her own time, 2027; http://anidb.net/ch25804 [Tooru] has waited over thirty years for her, and he turns out to be the landlord for her cafe.",
