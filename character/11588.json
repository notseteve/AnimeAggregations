  "description" : "Hikari is a 10-year-old Pokemon trainer and coordinator that travels with Ash Ketchum during Pokémon: Diamond & Pearl. Following in her mother`s footsteps as a coordinator, she chooses a Piplup, which she had already befriended at an earlier point, and sets out with the goal of winning the Grand Festival. After meeting Ash and Brock, she becomes rivals with another coordinator, Zoey, as well as her childhood friend, Kenny and goes on to win the Floaroma Ribbon, the Wallace Cup`s Aqua Ribbon, the Celestic Ribbon and the Chocovine Town Ribbon. Before entering her third contest, Dawn was very confident in herself, training with her Pokémon before every contest. However, after entering the Hearthome City Contest, Dawn started to lose confidence after she became the first coordinator to not pass the first round for the contest.",
