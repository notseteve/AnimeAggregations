  "description" : "Col Millard Johnson is in charge of Project Super Nova, a UN Spacy program deployed to determine the next generation of Variable fighter. Col Millard is most often found in the anime trying to control the feud between http://anidb.net/ch48622 [Guld Goa Bowman] and http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu Alva Dyson], many times counseling http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu] with words of wisdom that mostly infuriate the young pilot.In http://anidb.net/a3392 [Macross Plus the Movie], after http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu] stole the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] to interfere with the introduction of Ghost X-9 UCAV and http://anidb.net/ch48622 [Guld] was sent in the http://anidb.net/ch48623 [YF-21] after the runaway VF, Millard commented that he used to steal planes as well and decided to cover up for the two of them just like his then-superiors did for him. Whether he stole planes as a covert job or simply as an act of misconduct remains unexplained.",
