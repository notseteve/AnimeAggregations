  "description" : "The Meltlandi Laplamiz-Class Mobile Fortress was seen only briefly near the end of Space War I. This immense spacecraft, comparable in size to the Zentradi http://anidb.net/ch49058 [Gol Boddole Zer Class Mobile Fortress], served as the mothership for the Laplamiz Meltlandi fleet. As tall as the ship is wide, the Laplamiz mobile fortress appears in the familiar magenta colors of the Meltlandi fleets but the hull appears almost rock-like in design, resembling a multi-tiered mountain range. The Laplamiz class is many times the size of the large Meltlan Flagships and within it`s hull the mothership can berth numerous other craft for fueling and supply. During the final decisive conflict of Space War I, the Laplamiz class led the Meltlandi fleet in battle against the Zentradi Gol Boddole Zer fleet.

The http://anidb.net/ch49058 [Zentradi Mobile Fortress] fired it`s massive main beam gun upon the Laplamiz Mobile Fortress, destroying the Meltlandi mothership, a portion of the Meltlandi fleet and thousands of the Zentradi`s own ships.
