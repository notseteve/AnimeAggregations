  "description" : "Kuramoto Chinatsu is http://anidb.net/ch76922 [Makoto]`s cousin and http://anidb.net/ch79785 [Kei]`s little sister. Initially wary of Makoto, who she found strange when they first met, she quickly comes to like her after Makoto takes her flying on a broom.\nChinatsu became fascinated with magic after watching Makoto doing something that involved witchcraft or something supernatural. After a while, she asked http://anidb.net/ch80570 [Akane] to take her as her apprentice in order to learn more about magic and become a witch herself.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
