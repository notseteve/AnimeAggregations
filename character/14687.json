He has sent out minions to try and find the location of the last of these fountains, the Fountain of the Sun. He appears as a shadow-covered towering robed demon like being with a pair of glowing red eyes which shine out of the cave in which he lives. His name comes from 2 words, \"aku (evil)\" and \"daikan (a local administrator of Tokugawa shogunate)\". Aku-daikan (a dishonest administrator) is a kind of typical villain of jidaigeki.",
