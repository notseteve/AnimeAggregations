  "description" : "Hotaru was a member of the five stars of the Mibu and was sent to spy on Kyou. He has great admiration for the blood-thirsty and icy Kyou and resents Kyou`s softer side that has developed by coming into contact with Yuya. He also resents his older half-brother Shinrei (another member of the five stars) due to the fact that Shinrei is the valued \"wanted son\" while he, Hotaru, is the illegitimate son of a concubine.\nDespite Shinrei`s ignorance of the truth, Hotaru`s entire life seems centered around his animosity towards his brother. All he does is counter Shinrei. Where Shinrei uses water (their father being a Master of the Muryou Saikyou Ryuu School, the water school of the Mibu), Hotaru devotes himself to fire. Where Shinrei swore to uphold the honor and wishes of the Mibu Clan, Hotaru rebelled. Where Shinrei sought strength through friendship and camaraderie, Hotaru sought strength through solitude. This prompts him to battle his former allies, the Shiseiten and Kyou, because he believes that they stand between himself and the solitude needed for true strength.",
