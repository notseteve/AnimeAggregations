  "description" : "Kidachi is a curator at the Shippo City Museum where he specializes in Egyptian like artifacts and archeology. His wife is Aloe, the Shippo City Gym Leader and he often calls her `Mama`, similar how parents refer to each other when they have their kids around. He accidentally thought that a Desumasu mask was a replica and was part of the traveling exhibit and he placed it in the display case not knowing that the Desumasu that owned the mask had fallen asleep and it had dropped on the ground. Kidachi closed the Museum while he tried to investigate the reason for a mysterious poltergeist that had begun to scare him in the museum since the exhibit arrived.\nWith the help of Aloe, Kidachi was able to realize that he had accidentally locked away the mask and it was returned to the Desumasu, allowing the exhibit to be opened to the public.",
