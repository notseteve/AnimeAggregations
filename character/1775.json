  "description" : "Isaac is an idiot thief who owes his success to the insanity of his crimes (i.e. stealing non-valuable items such as chocolate, or breaking into a watch shop to \"steal time\") and the garish costumes he habitually wears, leading witnesses to assume that he is a performer of sorts rather than a thief. He is in love with his partner-in-crime, Miria. He becomes immortal in 1930, after drinking the immortality liquor.",
