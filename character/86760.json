  "description" : "Palossand is a dual-type Ghost/Ground Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Sandygast starting at level 42.\nPalossand is a Pokémon resembling a yellowish sand castle with gray pebbles along the base. It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth. The central tower has six windows: three in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand`s main body has crenellations around the central tower. A ring of alternating pink and blue seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top.\nPalossand controls adults to make them build it a sand castle, which provides it a disguise and defense. However, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on its head rotates when Palossand searches for prey and is believed to function as radar. It enjoys the life force of Pokémon. By creating a sandy vortex, it will capture small Pokémon and absorb their life force. Traces of its victims` ill will are left where Palossand passes, and this is said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.",
