She explained that a special power that exists onlyin the Galar region is still shrouded in mystery but she is continuing to learn about it herself with the help of Sonia. The professor is getting old and walks with a cane now.\nShe studies Galar Particles and found out that Pokémon and this special power in them are related. Galar Particles can be seen as red light given off at special Power Spots and the particles are part of that light and they bring out a power that lies within Pokémon and beckons them to Dynamax. She had a theory that they could utilize this property to control the enlargement of Pokémon and she approached Chairman Rose of Macro Cosmos, and they successfully developed the Dynamax Band.\nShe withdrew from the research she was doing with Chairman Rose because he saw a certain madness in his eyes and she knew that he`d stop at nothing when it came to realizing his dreams.",
