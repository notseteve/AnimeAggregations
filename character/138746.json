  "description" : "One of three known supreme rulers of the Covenant, alongside Mercy and Regret. One of the High Prophets of The Covenant during the mid-22nd century. In Halo Legends, he is never identified by name: first appearing in “The Duel”, he is shown declaring then-current Arbiter Fal ‘Chavamee a heretic, recruiting the Arbiter’s clan to kill him. After the events of “The Duel,” he declares the title of Arbiter to be changed from a mark of honor to a mark of shame. He returns in “Odd One Out”, where he orders the recently-created Pluton to kill what he believed was Master Chief, when in reality was 1337. In the Japanese credits of the episode, he is credited as “Prophet of Truth,” whereas in the English credits he is referred to as “The Prophet.” His title of the High Prophet of Solemnity was revealed in the Halo Encyclopedia (2022 Edition).(Source: Halopedia)",
