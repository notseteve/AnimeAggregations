  "description" : "An ingenuous and polite seventh grader who befriends http://anidb.net/ch6847 [Utena], despite their role as possible opponents in the duels. He is especially known for his skill with the piano. In spite (or because of) his genius, he is lonely, sheltered, and insecure, and seeks a person who is just as pure and talented as him. His Rose Crest is light blue.\nA piano player par excellence, Miki has fond memories of playing songs with his twin sister http://anidb.net/ch7312 [Kozue] in his childhood, but her refusal to play with him in the present — the symbol of a much deeper rift — gives Miki a sense of loss. His crush on http://anidb.net/ch6889 [Anthy] in the anime (but on Utena in the manga) develops when he realises that they remind him of his estranged sister. In both adaptations, his drive to duel stems from a desire to find something to replace Kozue in his affections. All the females of the school, even older ones, idolise him, but Kozue threatens any girls who attempt to get too close to him. Likewise he is very protective of her, and so she tries to make him jealous by dating as many boys as possible. Letters sent to Miki from his parents hint at the fact that his parents are divorced.\nHe is a member of the http://anidb.net/ch9171 [Student Council], his position appearing to be the council secretary. He frequently appears with a stopwatch in hand. Miki is also a member of the fencing club.",
