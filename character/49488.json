  "description" : "The Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class Fleet Command Battleship was a distinguished vessel in the UNG military post-Space War I. http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai Kridanik], formerly commander of the Zentradi Adoclass Fleet, had become a high ranking leader in the UNG military and his Nupetiet-Vergnitzs had been officially christened as the first battleship of the New UN Forces in December 2012. The Nupetiet-Vergnitzs class, following a minor refit in 2012, underwent a complete refit and redesign with additional Earth technology. The class was designated the Neo Nupetiet-Vergnitzs bis and the hull was completely rebuilt to bring the ship in line with the new motif of the modern UNG fleet. Two external dorsal bridges (one to the fore and one to the aft) were added and additional antennae were built including two main dorsal antennae aft of the bridge and one main ventral antenna. These ships served in colonization fleets in 2040s. One Neo Nupetiet-Vergnitzs Class was part of the Macross 5 fleet that was completely destroyed by the Varauta on the planet Rax in September 2045.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/neo-nupetiet-vergnitzs.htm",
