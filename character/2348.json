  "description" : "Kuroda Hikari is a temperamental and fastidious student in year one of class three, recognisable by her signature squid rings hairstyle.\nShe initially believes that http://anidb.net/ch2344 [Makoto] and http://anidb.net/ch2346 [Sekai] are dating from the very start, and tends to negatively generalise him; later growing closer to him herself. Though she is actually quite friendly and social, Hikari is the most childish of the cast; sporting an unduly knack for whining and prying into the affairs of others.\nHer family owns a confectionery store and caf√©, famous for its lemon custard pie. Hikari is good friends with Sekai and has an unreciprocated crush on http://anidb.net/ch2351 [Sawanaga Taisuke].",
