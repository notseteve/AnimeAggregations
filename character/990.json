  "description" : "Camerupt is the evolution of Numel. The volcano-shaped humps are formed by a transformation of Camerupt`s bones. Within Camerupt`s body is the violent activity of a volcano, containing molten magma of up to 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit that occasionally erupts from its volcanic mountain-shaped humps. This phenomenon happens naturally about once every ten years, but it most often occurs when Camerupt becomes enraged. Camerupt lives in the craters of volcanoes.",
