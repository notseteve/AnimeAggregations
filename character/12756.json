During the course of the story they try to understand and cope, and to help Kazuna cope, with the events that happen. Aunt Natsuko is featured more prominently in the story than Shin, and makes it very clear she wants Kazuna to think of her as his mother. When Kazuna asks Shin about his father, Shizuna, Shin lies about his death. Although Natsuko tries, she doesn`t seem to be a very good cook, even still, Kazuna eats all the food she prepares for him. She`ll often leave his school lunch prepared for him on the table with a short note when she has to go to work early in the morning.",
