  "description" : "Crawdaunt are tempestuous and destructive creatures; they will challenge other living beings in their territory to battle whenever necessary. They use their claws to throw other Pokémon out of their ponds, causing them to become very desolate areas. Older Crawdaunt usually have many scars on their pincers from the battles in which they prevailed. Crawdaunt sheds its shell regularly; this leaves the exposed body vulnerable to attacks while the new shell is soft. In such a weakened condition, a Crawdaunt usually burrows into the bottom of its pond to avoid attacks from enemy Pokémon.",
