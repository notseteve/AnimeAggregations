  "description" : "Doyle helped Officer Jenny (Isshu) try to figure out what was happening to the Tabunne. While they were tracking a Tabunne in a foggy forest, Doyle mistakenly thought that Ash and his friends might be related to the incidents when they saw them trying to talk to the staggering Tabunne. Doyle quickly apologized for getting Doyle`s Solosis to use Pyschic on them.\nHe explained that he wanted to help Officer Jenny (Isshu) investigate the Tabunne incidents because his grandpa`s Tabunne when missing and he is very upset. He vowed that he and his Solosis would find the culprit no matter what. He had a bit of a rivalry going on with Christie as they both wanted to impress Officer Jenny (Isshu).\nPer Officer Jenny (Isshu), Doyle went to an old couple that had a Tabunne to attach a tracking chip to its body while Ash came along with Doyle. Like most younger kids, Doyle got a bit silly but Officer Jenny (Isshu) kept him in check by telling that it wasn`t a detective game and that it was serious.\nDoyle relies on his Solosis`s Pyschic for attacking as well as for strategic movements. When they were tracking the Tabunne, he told his Solosis to use Pyschic to lift everyone up the side of the cliff after the Tabunne pulled up the ladder so they couldn`t get up.\nAfter helping Ash and his friends defeat Team Rocket and rescue his grandfathers Tabunne, he was eager to ask Officer Jenny (Isshu) if his Solosis was the most helpful to show up Christie and Christie`s Gothita but Officer Jenny (Isshu) told him that Ash`s Roggenrola contributed the most. With a lighthearted laugh, he accepted her judgement respectfully.",
