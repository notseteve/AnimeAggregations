  "description" : "A young noblewoman of the House of Borromeo, who is betrothed to Romeo in a political marriage at the Rose Ball. Sweet, sheltered and gentle, she appears to be genuinely in love with him though he doesn`t reciprocate her feelings for him. However, she`s also very passive-aggressive, having the tendency to keep her negative feelings or thoughts for herself, only to unleash them later. Thus, she expresses mild yangire traits during Romeo`s banishment.",
