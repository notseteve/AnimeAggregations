  "description" : "At the end of the One Year War, many Zeon remnants flee the Earth Sphere to the asteroid base Axis, determined to regroup and rebuild their forces before renewing their revolution against the Earth Federation. The MS-14A Gelgoog, the last mass production mobile suit fielded by the Zeon military during the war, has proven itself as an excellent high-performance unit. However, more powerful and advanced mobile suit technology is being developed in the Earth Sphere, and Axis has to keep up and train its pilots to handle better mobile suits. Thus, Axis upgrades its surviving Gelgoog units into the MS-14J Regelgu, with features like the new standard 360-degree panoramic cockpit. The Regelgu now sports large shoulder armor binders, each housing additional thrusters and verniers for extra speed and maneuverability. Two external propellant tanks are added to the backpack to provide an extended flight range on par with lighter and more modern mobile suits. A backpack missile pod, forearm grenade launchers, a pair of beam sabers and a beam rifle round out the armament. With these new features, the Regelgu is a tremendous improvement over its successful, tried-and-true previous form. Axis (later Neo Zeon) continues to use their ReGelgs for several years, with one unit operated by ace pilot Illia Pazom during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088.\nSource: mahq.net",
