  "description" : "Ogawa Mei is a freshman on the Seimei High School kendo team. She joined the team to be with her friends, although all of them eventually quit, until she was the very last freshman girl left on the team. This discouraged her, and she desired to quit the kendo team after the practice with Muroe High, but was convinced otherwise after getting fired up practicing with Tamaki.\nWikipedia",
