  "description" : "Haruka is a stubborn, protective individual, but is also strong-willed, capable, charming, lesbian, and occasionally even doting. She is formally introduced in the third story arc, although she appears in silhouette alongside Sailor Neptune in the final episode of Sailor Moon R. She is the second tallest of the Sailor Senshi at 5`9\", just behind Sailor Pluto at 5`10\".\nHaruka is a racecar driver, even though she is barely sixteen years old when she appears. However, the timing of her birthday to the Japanese school year means she is one grade ahead of the Guardian Senshi.",
