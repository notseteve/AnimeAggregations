  "description" : "The younger of twin brothers on the Shinryuji Naga American football team, Agon is considered a genius player for whom the sport comes naturally - not least of all by himself - and treats everyone other than himself as worthless trash. However, he is forced to come to grips with his own arrogant ways and feelings when he faces the Deimon Devil Bats in the Kanto tournament playoff, particularly the trio of Yoichi Hiruma, Ryokan Kurita, and Gen \"Musashi\" Takekura, of whom his actions allowed them to form a rival football team in the first place. His position of running back also makes him a rival towards Deimon`s Sena Kobayakawa. His reaction time of 0.11 sec is basically the fastest time that is possible for a human being to react.",
