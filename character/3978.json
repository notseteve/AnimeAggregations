  "description" : "The Scrapped Princess. Originally thrown over a cliff when she was just a baby, she survived and was adopted by the Casull family as their youngest child. With her blonde hair and blue eyes, she is the spitting image of her mother, and her sweet nature does not seem to suggest any ill things about her. Pacifica is young and innocent despite all that is going on around her, but she questions how so much suffering can occur due to her existence and blames herself for it. She is prophesized to be the poison that destroys the world when she turns 16 years of age.\nBecause of this so called prophecy, shortly before she turns 16 Pacifica is stabbed and killed by her twin brother Prince Forsyth at the end of the show. On the day of her 16th birthday, her power to destroy Providence would have reached its zenith, and the spell within her would activate. After her death, Pacifica then finds herself confronting Celia Mauser, whom she is a physical recreation of, in a virtual world. While she was killed just before her 16th birthday, the power she had gained in the time she was alive was enough so that the destruction of Providence was still possible, with the addition of Pacifica`s own will. After learning why Providence was created, Celia gives Pacifica the choice to determine humanity`s future. Even though Pacifica is sympathetic to having a protected, `ideal` world to live in, she chooses instead to let humans make their own choices, and as a result of this decision, Celia disappears and Providence is destroyed, freeing mankind once and for all. After everything is over and done with and the world is finally safe, Pacifica returns to her family farm with Shannon, Raquel, and Zefiris.",
