  "description" : "This huge transformable mobile armour, was developed by the Murasame Newtype Lab for use by their artificially-enhanced Cyber-Newtypes. The Murasame Lab`s original goal was simply to equip a Gundam with a psycommu system, the psychic interface developed by Zeon scientists during the One Year War. However, the sheer bulk of this device - and the addition of features like a Minovsky craft flotation system, a protective anti-beam barrier, and complex transformation mechanisms - resulted in the Psyco Gundam becoming a forty-metre monster. As well as its immense firepower, the Psyco Gundam houses a more subtle weapon... a combat system which overrides its pilot`s will and forces her to fight.",
