  "description" : "Milotic primarily live at the bottom of large lakes, suggesting that they have both lungs and gills. Because they are considered the most beautiful of all Pokemon, they have been depicted in paintings and statues. Milotic have the power to becalm such emotions as anger and hostility to quell bitter feuding. Those that see it are said to forget their combative spirits right away; in particularly strong cases of anger, however, a Milotic`s body can glow a vivid pink and release a pulsing wave of energy that brings soothing calm to the restless spirits of the people and Pok√©mon involved.\nThe evolution of Feebas into Milotic is unique within the Pokemon video games, in that a Feebas will only evolve into Milotic when its Beauty condition is sufficiently high.",
