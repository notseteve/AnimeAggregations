  "description" : "The medium-sized, gunboat-class is a famous Meltlandi vessel that was commanded by the ever more famous http://anidb.net/ch49062 [Milia 639] during Space War I. The two large-sized engines provide the gunboat with such high maneuverability and acceleration the ship can achieve the same capabilities as a space fighter. An excellent battleship, the gunboat boasts a potent high-output, short-range guided converging beam gun built as the bow of the ship. When preparing to fire, the bow of the gunboat separates laterally, gathers energy between the two forward booms and releases a very destructive blast at an enemy target. The gunboat class is suitable for a myriad of operation roles including search, reconnaissance, raids upon enemy bases or special missions. Like it`s counterpart vessel the http://anidb.net/ch48996 [Quiltra-Quelamitz] in the male Zentradi fleets, the gunboat is also well equipped for atmospheric maneuvering. Since it is operated by female Meltlandi, the ship carries a complement of http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] mecha. The Meltlandi sent a gunboat to Earth to intercept and destroy the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] upon its return. With a devastating blast from the powerful main gun, the Meltlan gunboat destroyed the top hull booms on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1]`s own main gun, causing the massive vessel to crash.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/Meltran-gunboat.htm",
