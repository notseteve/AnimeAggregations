  "description" : "Viola`s Vivillon is her pride as a Gym Leader and the Pokémon she often counts on during gym battles. It was the second Pokémon that Viola sent out to battle against Ash in both their battles.\nIn the first round, Ash`s Fletchling was defeated by Viola`s Vivillon after it got caught in the Sticky Web from earlier in the battle and couldn`t break free when Vivillon`s SolarBeam hit it.\nRealizing that he needed to train his Pokémon some more, Ash`s Fletchling was able to learn from the training in the rematch battle and ride the wind better but it was still defeated by Viola`s Vivillon. Pikachu though still had damage left from its fight against Ametama but it overcame that and was able to wake up from Sleep Powder by using Electro Ball on itself. With ice on its wing, Viola`s Vivillon started moving strangely giving Pikachu the opportunity to knock it out with Thunderbolt to win the rematch gym battle.",
