  "description" : "Nuzleaf is the larger evolved form of Seedot. Nuzleaf is a forest-dwelling Pok√©mon that is skilled at climbing trees, though they occasionally venture out of the forest to startle people. They live in holes bored in large trees. Its long and pointed nose is its weak point, and it loses power if the nose is gripped. For this reason, it dislikes having its long nose pinched. Nuzleaf will sometimes pull out the leaf on its head and make a flute with it. The sound of Nuzleaf`s flute strikes fear and uncertainty in the hearts of people lost in a forest. This is a reference to Pan, the Greek god of the forest.",
