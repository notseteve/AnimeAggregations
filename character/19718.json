  "description" : "A tiny fairy seen most of the times at Alviss` side. Belle befriended Alviss in his earlier years while he was training under Gaira`s supervision and from then on has cherished a passion for him, which borders on monopolising crush: she cares for him a great deal, and gets jealous of whomever Alviss so much as behaves intimately to (which ranges from girls to friends, e.g. Alan). Belle and Edward host extras at the end of each episode that sums up the plot of each episode and lists the Ã„RM Chess Pieces use in that episode. In the end of the anime, Alviss and Belle live together. Named for Tinkerbell from Peter Pan.",
