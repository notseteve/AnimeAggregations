  "description" : "Toujou Ayumu is http://anidb.net/ch1667 [Kyuubee]`s servant, who is extremely dedicated, if not obsessive, in his concern for his young master. He generally speaks in a very polite (original Japanese dub) manner, using -masu and -desu instead of the short dictionary forms usually employed in a normal male-speech. He addresses http://anidb.net/ch1667 [Kyuubee] as waka, which means young master, and has for years kept a diary recording http://anidb.net/ch1667 [Kyuubee]`s activities. http://anidb.net/ch1667 [Kyuubee] is usually indifferent to Toujou`s excessive attention, although she did kick him when he commented that gothic lolita clothes would suit her. Toujou`s eyes are normally closed unless he is surprised or under emotional distress. If his eyes do open, the whites of his eyes are actually black, and his pupils either glow with an unearthly green, blue or red. He has an obsession with beating a raw, unbroken egg yolk on his rice for meals (as shown when the egg yolk broke, and him going into a berserk rage quite uncharacteristic with his usual demeanour).",
