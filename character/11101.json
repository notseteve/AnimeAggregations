  "description" : "The prototype mobile suit Gyan was developed, under the supervision of Captain M`quve, as a competitor to the Gelgoog. However, its lack of long-range weapons and poor space manoeuvrability led to the project`s cancellation. Undaunted, M`quve uses one of the surviving Gyan prototypes in a cunning attack on the Gundam at the Texas colony, employing its arsenal of bombs and missiles to lure his enemy into duelling range.",
