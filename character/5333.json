  "description" : "Also known as \"Wahan\", she is a good friend of Lashara, a brilliant inventor, and a genius when it comes to heavy artillery and gunpowder (ironically, she can`t seem to hit her targets). While she may appear to be a 15 year-old girl, her actual age is 97 due to difference in time flow at the Barrier Workshop, where she lived prior to moving to the Swan with the others. She later invented the Kikkoujin, a steam-powered mechanoid resembling an Uchikoma with greater maneuverability than what a Seikijin would provide. Her Seikijin is brown with bull`s horns made for heavy combat. Like Lashara and Chiaia, she has feelings for Kenshi, although she usually wants to use her machines on him.\nSource: Wiki",
