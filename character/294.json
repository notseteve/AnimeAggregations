  "description" : "Hakua is a girl from Jin`s school possessed by Zange.\nSince childhood, Hakua was able to see spiritual images around her and her body has been very susceptible to spiritual possession. As other children considered her ability very odd, she had trouble interacting with children of her age.\nWhen she was still a child, she makes a friend with Jin during a summer camp, who did not consider her ability strange as he also possessed a strong spiritual sense.\nHowever, in the current storyline, Jin doesn`t seem to remember well about his encounter with Hakua in the past.\nSince then, Hakua has not been able to go outside her house and she compared herself to a \"princess locked up in a castle\".\nJust before Hakua attempted to commit suicide due to depression, she \"willingly accepted\" Zange to be her host.\nHowever Nagi claims that despite this, it may put too much stress into her body.\nBoth Zange and Hakua develop a liking for Jin and decide to bring him to their side.",
