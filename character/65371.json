  "description" : "Sanpei is a ninja boy that knows the Ninja art of leaf concealment. He lives in the Ninja Village and likes to train alongside his Pok√©mon. He speaks in a pseudo-archaic manner. He has two brothers that live in the village: his eldest brother and strongest combatant of the ninja village, with his Gekkouga and the number two of the ninja village, his brother Nihei and Fushigibana.\nSanpei was watching Ash`s Froakie train in a forest near Shoyo City when he revealed himself camouflaged in front of a tree. His training showed Ash how helpful it could be when he defeated Ash`s Froakie in a battle. Clemont commented that he`d never seen a Quick Attack like the one Sanpei`s Frogadier was able to do. Sanpei is quite proud of the attack as no one gets up after the attack which is very fast and powerful. Despite being rivals on the battlefield, Sanpei was friendly enough to help Ash`s Froakie learn Quick Attack at the request of Ash although the training ended up that it learned Double Team.\nAfter an encounter with Team Rocket, Sanpei gained new found respect for Ash and the two of them vowed to have another battle if they met again.",
