  "description" : "Houndoom live in packs, whose leader is decided by fierce fighting among its members. The leader develops horns sharply raked towards its back to display its dominant status. A Houndoom`s body is filled with volatile toxins that ignite when exposed to air, causing pungent-smelling flames to be shot. The flame will cause persistent pain that can never be alleviated. Houndoom is a feared predator among Pokémon, with its howl being likened to the howl of the Grim Reaper in legend. Just the sound of its howl is enough to send all other Pokémon which hear it hurrying back to the safety of their nests.",
