  "description" : "Cliff`s Mienfoo came to the rescue of Ash and his friends when they encountered a bunch of angry Beartic. Cilan was immediately able to identify it despite the fact that it was moving very fast which made it hard to determine what it was. Cliff`s Mienfoo is a very fast Pok√©mon which combined with its fighting skills, made it a tough opponent for the entire group of Beartic which it was able to knock out all of them by itself.\nCliff`s Mienfoo lives with its trainer Cliff at a cabin in a forest between Raimon Town and Raimon City. While trying to resolve the conflict between the two groups of Beartic, Cliff`s Mienfoo used Quick Guard to defend the attacks so that no one could get hurt.",
