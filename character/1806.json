He has inherited the Book of Friends, a book of names that no one but Reiko, Takashi, and other spirits can read. Because of Takashi`s strong resemblance to Reiko, he is often mistaken for her, causing spirits who hate Reiko to chase him constantly. He decided to dissolve the Book by giving all the names back to their owners. He is accompanied by the spirit http://anidb.net/ch10380 [Madara], nicknamed \"Cat\" because of the spirit`s appearance, and has promised that to pass the book on to Cat when he dies.",
