  "description" : "In her younger days, Renny had worked as the assistant to her father on the Second Exorcist Project at the http://anidb.net/ch32500 [Asian Branch], 6th laboratory. Back then, her job mainly was to monitor http://anidb.net/ch84586 [Yu] and http://anidb.net/ch84587 [Alma], and to report on any abnormalities.\nLater, along with her father and Twi Chang, she helped seal up Yu when he started to regain his old memories. When Alma went on a killing rampage, she was the only survivor of the massacre as Twi Chang helped her escape before being killed herself.\nAfter the massacre and tragedy, she and Bak Chang sealed off the human experiments as taboos. However, in the recent times, she had a change of heart after the invasion of http://anidb.net/ch32720 [Lulu Bell] and attack of the Level 4 at the http://anidb.net/ch32499 [Headquarters], as she willingly headed the Third Exorcist project after receiving the Akuma egg fragment from http://anidb.net/ch32795 [Malcolm C. Lvellie].\nSource: D.Gray-Man Wiki, edited.",
