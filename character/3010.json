At first sight, she looks like the cute type of character, but at 14 years old, she has 11 years of experience in the entertainment business, so she is also a veteran entertainer, who is strict about etiquette! She seems greatly displeased with Minoru Shiraishi, a newcomer recently experiencing a wave of success.",
