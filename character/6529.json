  "description" : "Teito`s best friend, Mikage comes from a family of stewards. Despite the fact that his closeness with Teito makes him a target of ill will, he remains a bright and cheerful person, sticking with Teito even if others make fun of him. Their relationship as friends involves a lot of Mikage teasing Teito about his short stature, and Teito beating him up in retaliation. Even so, they are still very close, promising each other that they will die together and will always be \"the best of friends\". Mikage also teaches Teito a lot about being friends and having compassion for others. After learning of Castor`s family`s grief for their son, he tells Seilan \"Mikage had told me... that if two people were together sadness would also be halved...\". Mikage often tries to get Teito to loosen up, telling him that if he smiles and laughs more, he`ll grow taller. After his death, Teito still finds it hard to go on without his best friend, even stating that \"When Mikage died... I felt like a part of me died as well\". Because of him, Teito begins his quest to all seven \"Houses of God\" in order to receive the `cursed tickets`, which will enable him to travel to the land of souls and trade his life for Mikage`s, discovering more about his forgotten past and about the Seven Ghosts in the process. When Mikage`s soul is taken by Ayanami and he dies, he begs Teito not to look for revenge, but instead to keep walking towards the light. This shakes Teito`s beliefs, because Mikage was his `light`.[8] Later, Mikage becomes reincarnated as a small pink dragon (called Burupya) because he wished to protect Teito, no matter what form.",
