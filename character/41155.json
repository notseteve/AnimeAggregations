  "description" : "Gamlin is an excellent soldier and a perfect gentleman, courteous, kind, and passionate about what he believes in. Outside of the military, however, he is a bit of a klutz and is easily embarassed. He has a tendency to become uptight about details, but most of the time maintains a good luck at the whole picture and unlike pilots such as Docker, has a good grasp of common sense.",
