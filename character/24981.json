  "description" : "A bearer of Cursed Eyes \"Ino Dwoe\" who is a devourer of flesh, he powers up his magic by consuming other people`s lives and by absorbing magicas well as being shown to have amazing athletic ability and strength. He has a past with Claugh Klom. He spares Claugh`s life prior to the events of the story by injuring a part of Claugh`s arm but not killing him. The latter to uses magic to save it.\nThe two fight again later on and Tiia easily defeats Clough, who loses his Crimson arm in the process. Claugh later uses forbidden cursed magic to regain it in a changed black form. Tiia`s motives are unknown, but as he has a problem to control his power, he may not have a motive or loyalty for his doings at all. His eyes have Ino Dwoe`s power and when the power manifests, a cross-shaped symbol appears over the pupils of the bearers, allowing them to absorb magical energy and increase their powers.\nDespite his inhuman actions, Tiia has been shown to have a kind, polite, and even compassionate side towards others, especially those he deems as monsters.",
