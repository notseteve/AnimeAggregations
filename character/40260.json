  "description" : "Aria is Rea`s stepmother. She used to be a maid for Dan`ichirou and was trained under a long-standing tradition in the Sanka family that future heirs are to marry the best of the maids. The maids were selected from good families and taught how to be ladies in areas such as deportment, grace, etc. as to be great trophy wives if selected to marry into the family. Dan`ichirou however met and married Rea`s mother which he loved dearly until her death while giving birth to Rea. Although Dan`ichirou married Aria, he does not give her real attention instead watching over Rea, which has made their relationship a strained one at best. As a result she treats Rea coldly, tries to get Dan`ichirou interested in her, and drunk most of the time she`s not working at school (She`s the Chairwoman of Rea`s school.) She secretly despises Rea due to how she`s loved by everyone and the sole target of Dan`ichirou`s obesssion.\nSource: Wikipedia",
