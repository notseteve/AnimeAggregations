  "description" : "Zazan (ザザン) is a scorpion-humanoid Chimera Ant squadron leader that resembles an extremely buxom, attractive woman with a scorpion`s stinger tail, whose murderous subordinates include her doting right hand Pike (パイク). While gathering humans for the Queen, Zazan captures Pokkle and brings him to the colony. Following the Queen`s death, Zazan leaves NGL to start her own colony in Meteor City and turns a large number of humans there into subservient minions with her Nen ability Sexy Stinger of Rebirth: Queen Shot (審美的転生注射). This causes the native Phantom Troupe to attack her hive. Zazan is also able to transform herself into a larger monster with greater strength and super-hard skin, which she uses as a last resort against Feitan who ultimately incinerates her.\nSource: Wikipedia",
