  "description" : "Yakumo is the King of Meikai (冥界, dark world) and the primary antagonist of Yuu Yuu Hakusho The Movie: Poltergeist Report.\nAlthough much of his past history is unknown, Yakumo maintains the countenance of a distinguished and effective leader. He is seen to have a very controlling and self-righteous personality, which allows him to work toward a goal efficiently, calmly assessing his tactical situation and having confidence in his ability to succeed.\nOverall, he remains very calm and mysterious throughout his appearances, presumably deep in thought about ensuring his plan to gain possession of the different worlds comes to fruition. He is somewhat aloof, having torn apart large areas of the human world nonchalantly, indifferent to others` opinions on moral basis of his actions. As his goal of restoring the Netherworld on new territory progressed as he had planned, Yakumo seems proud, and pleased, relieved that after so many years, he can know complete control.\nHe is extremely arrogant, to the point that Know your rightful place! is a catchphrase of his.\nSource: Wikia",
