  "description" : "Maki`s somewhat bratty younger half-sister. Her martial-artist father is the same as Maki`s, so she shares some of her older sister`s fighting ability, but none of her gravity-defying gymnastic skill, which Maki evidently got from her mother. In her first appearance, she suddenly attacks Maki. She is about the same height as Renge, though she is younger. She decides to move in with Maki. She later idolizes Sanpaguita Kai.",
