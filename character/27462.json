  "description" : "Tornadus is known as the Cyclone Pokémon. He is based on Fuujin, the god of wind.[citation needed] He is the first pure Flying-type Pokémon. Tornadus can only be encountered in Pokémon Black, after being seen causing massive storms all throughout the Unova region. Once seen at least once, it roams flying throughout the rest of the Unova region, waiting for its capture or defeat. The lower half of its body is covered in a cloud of energy. It zooms through the sky at 200 mph.\nIt was said to have been banished by Landorus after it and Thundurus were seen causing violent thunderstorms throughout the Unova Region.\nTornadus gains an alternate form in the upcoming games Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 after being obtained in the side game Pokémon Dream Radar (known in Japan as Pokémon AR Searcher). Tornadus`s Therian Forme resembles a bird, and its original form is called the Incarnate Forme.",
