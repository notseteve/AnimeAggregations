  "description" : "Masaomi participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament. He is very snooty and thinks he is superior to everyone. He is well dressed and well groomed though but that is part of his upper crust mentality. He likes to scout out his opponents by studying and spying on them to learn about their tendencies and weaknesses so that he can exploit them to his advantage. Masaomi`s Nageki has picked up on Masaomi`s attitude and the two of them seem to be able to play off of each other without actually having to speak as it was evident when Masaomi`s Nageki tried to intimidate Stephan`s Sawk.\nDonamite Tournament\nIn the first round of the Donamite Tournament, Masaomi faced Domon. Masaomi`s Nageki faced Domon`s Mienshao and showed its incredible strength by using a three move combo: Superpower, Seismic Toss and the finishing move Circle Throw. Domon`s Mienshao was knocked out before it was even able to land a successful blow. With the win, Masaomi advanced to the second round while Domon was eliminated from the tournament. At that point in time, Don George had Masaomi at the top of his list of favorites for the championship.",
