  "description" : "The Byakou is Thymilph`s personal Gunman. It is stored within the Dai-Gunzan`s hangar bays and first saw deployment during Team Dai-Gurren`s second attack on the mobile Gunman fortress. Equipped with a polearm called the Alkaid Glaive, it is capable of emitting a powerful energy beam attack from the tip of the weapon, Condemnn Blaze. The Byakou was especially deadly in single combat and proved to be even more lethal, when paired with the Enki in pummeling the lone Gurren. Unlike personal Gunman units fielded by the other Generals, the Byakou was never shown to have a distinct alternate configuration.\nThe Byakou was the first victim of the Gurren-Lagann`s multi-stage Giga Drill Break attack, which completely obliterated both the Gunmen and its pilot. It was also the last enemy defeated by Kamina, who was heavily wounded and died shortly after.",
