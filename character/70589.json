  "description" : "Naruse Mio is the main female protagonist of the series. She is the daughter of the previous Demon Lord, Wilbert, and a human named Ashe thus making her a humanoid demon, as well as the niece of Sapphire. After the \"death\" of her father, Mio inherited his power and was raised in the Human World as the daughter of two unnamed demons as a human. Though after the death of her adoptive parents, she was later saved by http://anidb.net/ch70588 [Maria] who revealed the truth about her lineage.\nBoth later came up with the ruse where their \"mother\" would be marrying http://anidb.net/ch70591 [Toujou Jin] and become the stepsisters of http://anidb.net/ch70590 [Basara] in an attempt to make their house their base, while father and son would have their memories altered and move elsewhere. However, this plan failed after both of them were revealed to be banished members of the Hero Clan, but Mio and Maria continue to live in the Toujou Household.\nSource: Shinmai Maou no Keiyakusha Wiki",
