  "description" : "Togekiss, known as the Jubilee Pokémon, is the evolved form of Togetic that is first introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. It resembles a moderately sized bird covered with white down. It has a crest similar to its earlier forms Togepi and Togetic, with blue and red feathers. Along its chest do spots resemble small red and blue triangles. Its overall shape resembles that of flying wing aircraft. It is a symbol of peace. This Pokémon is said not to appear where arguments and disagreements occur. Therefore, according to the Pokédex, it has not been seen for quite some time. Togekiss evolves from Togetic when a Shiny Stone is used on it.",
