Getting carried away, he walked in too far. Not only had he become lost in the forest, but the sun had also set; just when he thought all hope was lost, his Eievui evolved into Blacky. Thanks to Virgil`s Umbreon, Virgil got out of the forest and a special bond between him and Eievui was born.\nIsshu League Tournament\nVirgil`s Umbreon participated in the Isshu League Higaki Tournament.
