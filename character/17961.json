  "description" : "A recurring character, Inspector Manzou, known also as \"The Saw\", is a lampoon of Hanzo Itami. Aside from the main trio, Momotaro and Ichiemon the announcer, he is probably the only other character shown in multiple episodes (discounting flashbacks and multiple-part episodes). His persistence and enthusiasm are not without humorous results.\nAs he is a law enforcer, he carries a sort of billy-club with him wherever he goes and is apparently able to use it to perform calisthenics. In all three episodes in which he appears, he plays the narration for the part or all of the story. Oddly enough, his narration transcends time, as he has narrated about future events which he could not feasibly be alive long enough to know about, like Vincent van Gogh, the popularity of baseball throughout America today, the Zen movement in the 1960s, and even commentary on the modern-day Japanese views on sexuality contemporary to the show`s airing.\nSource: Wikipedia",
