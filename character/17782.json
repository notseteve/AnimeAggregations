  "description" : "Shidou Kouichi is the teacher of Class 3A. Rei Miyamoto is afraid and is disgusted by him and Saeko Busujima says his name with a scowl, showing that he apparently is a sadistic and villainous character. Both girls have good reasons to do so as we see him leaving behind a student who has sprained his ankle and even kicking him back towards a group of zombies chasing them. He then makes a speech about how weaklings do not deserve to exist. It was implied by Hirano that Shidou allowed bullies to beat him up as he watched with glee. It is assumed that the former`s story is true because Hirano pointed the nail gun at Shidou without blinking or hesitating to shoot a nail at his face.\nHe has a desire to be a leader, and some of the characters have theorized that he is trying to build a new religion with him on top as leader. Shidou is an apparent coward in the face of extreme danger, as seen when being threatened by a grazing head shot with a nail gun on Hirano`s part, but nonetheless, proves to be a manipulative, villainous and sadistic character.\nSource: Wiki",
