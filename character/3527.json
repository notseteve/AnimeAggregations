  "description" : "Potato is the town`s stray puppy dog that lives in town mostly with Kano. Potato seems to follow Kano a lot, and was the reason that Kano and Yukito met due to his interest in Yukito`s puppet show. Potato makes frequent appearances throughout the series though he exists mostly as a minor character for comic relief in the visual novel and anime. Potato`s only `word` is \"piko\", though sometimes he will say the variations \"pika\" or \"pikori\".",
