  "description" : "Igusa is another member of the pack that serves http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. She has green hair, which she wears in two braids and she wears spectacles. Igusa secretly writes shounen manga under the pseudonym `Ruriko Saffron` and is extremely shy, causing her to be nervous when around http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] when he`s in a perverted mood or when she perceives him to be thus. Despite her fear of perversion in men, she appears to be a closet fan of shounen-ai situations herself - a fact she apparently hides from her fellow pack members.",
