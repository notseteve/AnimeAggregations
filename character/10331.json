  "description" : "After she was rejected by her first love, Sunako developed an obsession with darkness and a morbid fascination with blood, horror movies, and similarly dark things. She hates excessive light exposure and also does poorly in hot weather, though the latter is because she grew up in northern Japan. She has three \"friends\"; a skeleton called Josephine and two anatomical figures named Hiroshi-kun and Akira-kun. While she suffers from severely low self-esteem, she is actually beautiful and a frighteningly tough fighter, being able to lift someone twice her size with one hand. She is portrayed (mostly) throughout the manga in Super deformed form or chibi. Somewhat surprisingly, she is a very good cook, very athletic, intelligent (save that she is abysmally bad at math) and a good pianist. She refers to beautiful people as \"creatures of light\" and \"ugly\" people, such as herself, as \"creatures of darkness\", in the translation in America. Whenever she sees a \"creature of light\", she gets nosebleeds, and they`re usually severe when she sees Kyohei. Despite her negative attitude, once she is driven to do something, Sunako is quite capable of doing things that no one expects her to complete.\nSource: wikipedia.org",
