  "description" : "Akhmad is the 3rd in command of the Maganac Corps in the series Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. While he is quieter than many of his comrades, he is still just as good a pilot. He is a little shorter than Abdul and Auda, but wears a bushy mustache. His Maganac suit utilizes a considerable amount of extra armor including heavier shoulder and skirt armor.",
