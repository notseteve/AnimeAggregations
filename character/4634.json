  "description" : "Fa is one of Kamille Bidan`s schoolmates from the Green Noa 1 space colony, and more or less his girlfriend. Her parents are arrested by the Titans after Kamille joins the AEUG, while she herself escapes with the help of Bright Noa and makes it to safety aboard the rebel flagship Argama. Fa proceeds to join the ship`s crew, eventually undergoing pilot training so she`ll have something to do other than argue with Kamille.",
