  "description" : "The Noah Family consists of thirteen human descendants of Noah who have inherited his genes. A Noah can be identified by a gray skin tone, yellow/gold eyes, and a horizontal line of seven cross-shaped stigmata referred to as holy marks. Like http://anidb.net/t6684 [Akuma] creatures, they base their powers off dark matter, the opposite of Innocence, and as such are vulnerable to Innocence. The Noah share an inborn drive to kill Exorcists, but otherwise possess unique will and mindsets. \"Carved\" on their genes is a memory of Noah different from any member in their generation and possess a supernatural ability. They claim to be immortal, but this is proven to be an exaggeration after Yu Kanda kills the Noah Skin Bolic.",
