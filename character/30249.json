  "description" : "Maedasaki Tarou is a Lieutenant in the Vigilance Corps (aka JSDF), he is fascinated by Out of Place Artifacts, which leads him to Reideen and Junki. Maedasaki monitors and tracks Junki on behalf of the VC, but is genuinely concerned about the boy, and treats him as a person, not a tool. Maedasaki is also an audiophile, and employs Junki part-time after school in their undercover vacuum tube business, the better to keep Junki nearby.",
