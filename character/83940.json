  "description" : "Kanno Naoshi is a World War II fighter pilot. During the battle with the http://anidb.net/ch81510 [Black King], with the http://anidb.net/ch86429 [Drifters]` side under attack by dragons, he was transported into the world in his plane. He decided to attack the dragons when their attacks reminded him of the U.S. bombing of Tokyo.\nHis plane later crashed and he soon found himself worshiped as a god by natives, only to be found by http://anidb.net/ch81506 [Scipio], who decides to use his status to unite the various anthropomorphic animal tribes under him to bolster the Drifters` army. He does not initially trust http://anidb.net/ch83937 [Butch] or http://anidb.net/ch83936 [Sundance Kid], as they are American, but Butch manages to convince him that they are Bolivian instead.\nSource: Wikipedia",
