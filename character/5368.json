  "description" : "A strange and na√Øve girl with a kind heart, she is very innocent and dedicated. She seeks to fill a mysterious bottle with the suffering in others` hearts so that someday she will be able to go to a certain place.\nHer only restriction appears to be that she cannot fall in love with a particular boy she will work for and whose heart she will heal. Kobato has a very cheerful and enthusiastic outlook in life and her wanting to aid others in need is very heartfelt and sincere. However, she can also be clumsy, rather stupid and rash with her actions and often trips, much to Ioryogi`s annoyance.",
