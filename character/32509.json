When Kanda expressed his loss of appetite, Buzz demanded an apology. However, Kanda beat him up and began strangling him. Allen then stepped in to stop the whole charade. He is a tall, burly man with many markings on his face and a bald head. Despite his appearance, he appears to be sensitive about his fallen colleagues. He appeared in the Leaf of Revival arc.",
