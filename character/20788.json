  "description" : "Ukagaka (伺か), also known as Nanika (何か), Sakura (さくら), Nin`i-tan (任意たん) or Nise-Haruna (偽春菜), is a catch-all term for Japanese software which shares a single format and function: to provide a pair of mascot characters for the user`s computer desktop. These mascot characters can perform some useful functions such as checking e-mail or adjusting the clock of the computer, but are most popular as an aesthetic add-on, which \"says\" weird things.\nCharacters are typically cute anime girls of original design as seen in the sample screenshot, accompanied by a small monster or pet of some sort.",
