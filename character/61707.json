  "description" : "Dunc is a Pokémon Hunter who attempted to catch Mewtwo. He used suspicious cameras to try to find Mewtwo`s location. He has a bold laugh that often trails out. He deceived Virgil and the others by saying that he too had been saved by Mewtwo but had infact been injured while trying to catch it. While attacking Mewtwo, his Chervargo were trapped by Dunc`s Tyranitar`s Hyper Beam but he told Virgil that a landslide had rendered them immobile. He explained that Mewtwo was created by humans by using Mew`s genes as base. It was created to be the strongest Pokémon but Mewtwo was abused for experiments. However, having grown distrustful of humans, Mewtwo destroyed the research facility and fled. Dunc lied and said he was searching for Mewtwo to offer it protection when in fact he was trying to catch it for his client who created Mewtwo. Unable to catch Mewtwo the second time he tried, Virgil said he`d take Dunc to Officer Jenny.",
