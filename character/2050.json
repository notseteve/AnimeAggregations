  "description" : "Femto is the incarnation of Griffith as a member of the God Hand. During the Incarnation Ceremony, he is reincarnated with a human body but given the gift of supernatural charisma and yet other unknown powers, continuing to chase his dream of a kingdom backed up by his new Band of the Hawk. Femto`s body appears as dark armour with cape-like wings on the back, with a demonic version of Griffith`s familiar hawk-beak helmet.\nHis currently displayed powers are flight via his dark, cape-like wings, a spherical energy shield that protects his body from attacks such as Guts` arm-cannon, and a powerful blast of dark energy that can rip apart even an Apostle in one hit. His first act as a member of the God Hand is to rape Casca, tainting the child she is bearing, which is Guts`.",
