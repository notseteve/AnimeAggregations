  "description" : "Goh`s Sobble was first seen outside a Pokémon Center in Wyndon in the Galar region. While eating, it came up to them while invisible and started eating all of their food. When it finally became visible again, it started crying and ran off. Goh wanted to find it and Nurse Joy (Galar) said that Sobble are usually Timid and that it might be hiding in the fountain. Goh tried to introduce himself but when there was no response he accidentally threw a Poké Ball and it caught Sobble who was actually there to his surprise.\nGoh`s Drizzile is the evolved form of Goh`s Sobble. After rescuing Goh`s Oddish from being hit by a Berry, it evolved into Drizzile. It had been hoping to evolve into an Inteleon but when it saw it`s reflection in the water it was disappointed and became depressed.",
