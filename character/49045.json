  "description" : "Before the development of the VF-4, Stonewell/Bellcom built the VF-X4 trial-production variable fighter as a prototype for the Lightning III. Development started in 2005 and eventually test flights were conducted in which some VF-X4 flights were flown by Space War I veteran http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. The trial-produced VF-X4 featured most of the key design features that would be included in the final VF-4 Lightning III design, but was initially built using 35% VF-1 Valkyrie parts (notably, the nose and forward fuselage of the VF-1 fighter). http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] had a scale model of the VF-X4 in his house in Macross City on Earth.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/vf-x-4.htm",
