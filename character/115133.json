  "description" : "Kakehashi Mirai was the chosen God candidate of the angel Nasse in the competition to become the next God.\nWounded by his abrasive upbringing, Mirai wished to end his life by jumping off a building. However, he was abruptly caught midair by Nasse, who came to tell him of his special mission as a handpicked candidate in the God choosing process, a paramount event that would determine the fate of humanity through the replacement of the current God.\nWith the help of the special abilities of the Wings and the Red and White Arrows, Mirai gained various allies to defeat Metropoliman, and later on, Yoneda Gaku in the selection process. Throughout the event, Mirai would come to realize the ultimate meaning of happiness and the sublime reasons for living.\nSource: Platinum End Wiki",
