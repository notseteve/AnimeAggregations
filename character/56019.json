  "description" : "A youngster offered in sacrifice to a Youi, but escaped with his mother. Outa was supposedly going to be a sacrifice to the mountain god near his village, but it seems to be implied that his father intended to kill and eat him instead (having done the same to the boy`s sister). When the mountain god appeared and absorbed Outa`s father, the boy was exposed to the Other World. His mother Tae took him on the run to escape the Youi, but the boy kept searching for the Other World because of the hardships of this one; after meeting and talking with Yukiatsu, he decides to stay with his mother in the real world.",
