  "description" : "Wisely is the Fifth Disciple of the http://anidb.net/ch10022 [Noah Family], representing the \"Wisdom\" of Noah. Now inhabiting the body originally that of a homeless man, he is the most recently fully reborn Noah.\nBeyond a long bandanna wrapped around his forehead, his most distinguishing characteristic is a series of eye-shaped emblems decorating his forehead, the largest of which he refers to as the \"Demon Eye\". Using this, he can peer into the hearts and minds of others; any who look into it fall under his influence, and should he wish, risk having their minds blown apart.\nAmong the Noah, he is the only one of those killed by http://anidb.net/ch84602 [the 14th] in his previous incarnation to still retain his old memories. Fairly laid-back, he is remarked by his siblings as being rather haplessly imprecise, and speaks in an old-fashioned form of Japanese.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
