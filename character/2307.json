  "description" : "Although he is male, Chiharu looks and sounds feminine. He is in charge of cleaning in the Kuonji household. As a nod, due to his less important role of the story, he is often being overlooked and forgotten by everybody. He grows to have a crush on Venis (which Ren, Yume or Natose could not believe) because she constantly looks out for him, but quickly let go of it as she told him that she may be attracted to Ren. Ren still felt uneasy towards Chiharu as a male and even declined to shower together with him.",
