  "description" : "The section chief of Bokuto Station`s Traffic Control Department is usually referred to simply as \"chief\" (課長, kachou). His name was first revealed to indeed spell \"Kachou\" (花蝶, kachou, lit. \"Flower butterfly\") in the second season by his monk uncle (a.k.a. FOX). He is a stern, but fair leader who uses a relaxed touch to keep his team of misfit officers in line. Natsumi had a long-standing crush on him before she met Toukairin. Though he allows his subordinates to do as they normally please in the station, he reminds them of their priorities as police officers.\nIn the movie, he got in trouble with Superintendent Arizuka when he was linked to Emoto, who was suspected of starting the Hachi-Ichi-Go (Bee Number 1) crisis in the Greater Tokyo Area. First stripped off his command and thrown into a cell by Arizuka due to suspicion of coercing with Emoto, he eventually disclosed details regarding both Emoto and Project \"Hachi-Ichi-Go\", as well as the fact that Emoto severed connections with him as well. During the final confrontation in Tokyo Tower, Emoto shot him in the leg, reinforcing the fact that he was not Emoto`s accomplice.\nHe uses a Honda NSX as his personal car when doing police work in the OVA. In the rest of the series, he uses a Honda Legend.",
