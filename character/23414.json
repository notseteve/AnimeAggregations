  "description" : "Hiroyuki, usually referred to as Yuki, is a tall and attractive transsexual woman living with her boyfriend http://anidb.net/ch23413 [Shiina]. Yuki takes an early interest in http://anidb.net/ch21555 [Yoshino] when she believes her to be a boy, though remains on good terms with her even after learning of her assigned sex, and gives http://anidb.net/ch21554 [Shuuichi] and Yoshino helpful advice when they are troubled. Despite the differences between their situations, Yuki sees a lot of herself in Shuuichi: when they were growing up, Shiina was the only friend who stood by the young Hiroyuki, as he was called then, while girls teased him and the boys bullied him to change. Yuki always keeps up a positive attitude, and runs a gay bar. Since her transition, she has not been on good terms with her parents, who run a uniform store.",
