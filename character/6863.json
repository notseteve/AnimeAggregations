  "description" : "A sickly girl (she has congenital heart disease) who is Suigintou`s medium. She lives in a hospital room, under constant care from nurses. Megu has a very bleak outlook on life and often prays for an \"Angel of Death\" to take her away. She sees herself as a burden upon her parents, who she claims are \"guilty\" of having her. She initially believes that Suigintou is the \"Angel of Death\" she has hoped for and requests that Suigintou kill her by draining away her energy. Despite her apathy (and, at times, contempt) towards life in general, she is quite needy, and increasingly desires Suigintou`s company, even throwing tantrums when Suigintou is away.",
