  "description" : "An impulsive young man, Michael immediately bares his fangs at people who oppose him, brandishing his trademark knife when feeling enraged or intimidated. Similar to his personality, he favours brutal tactics for mobile suit combat and specialises in attacks with the Gundam Throne Zwei`s all-range weapon, the GN Fangs. Though he feels somewhat protective over his younger sister, Nena, he frequently complains about having to comply to orders from his brother, Johann.",
