  "description" : "A very well endowed female, her assets are often used as a running gag. She is also somewhat tomboyish, not giving much care for her disposition or appearance (in fact, she was often referred to, particularly by Takayama, as a \"mountain monkey\") at one point. She is the bearer of the Witchblade. She seems to have become the Witchblade bearer during an event that destroyed most of Tokyo 6 years before the beginning of the series. Masane is also the caring mother of Rihoko Amaha. Although she is \"Riko`s\" mother, Masane seems to be a little ditsy at times, making Rihoko seem like she is the responsible one. She has a very deep attachment to her daughter.",
