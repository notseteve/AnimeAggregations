  "description" : "Dunsparce is a land snake based on the tsuchinoko, a legendary snake-like cryptid from Japan. It has a yellow hourglass shaped body, two tiny wings on its sides, a drill for a tail, and two spikes under its chin. Its underbelly is blue, as well as the markings on its back. Dunsparce lives in caves and deep underground in nests of complex design. Its rudimentary wings enable it to hover just above the ground, providing it with an alternate method of motion besides crawling. Despite these wings and bug-like appearance, Dunsparce is solely a normal type Pok√©mon.",
