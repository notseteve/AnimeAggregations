  "description" : "Shigekuni Nandaba is Naota`s grandfather. He owns the family bakery and coaches the local baseball team, the Mabase Martians. He despises Mamimi for unspecified reasons, but it is suggested that he didn`t approve of Tasuku dating her. Shigekuni values baseball more than anything in the world â€” he is disappointed in his own son and younger grandson because they are lousy baseball players. He does not defend Naota as the other players mock him, because he holds too much pride for Tasuku. He enjoys taking advantage of Canti as much as Kamon does. He has an affinity for pornography. In the first episode, he mistakes \"furi kuri\" with \"kuri kuri,\" a sound effect often used in hentai during any twisting motion, often breasts or nipples, although the same onomatopoeia stands for kneading dough.",
