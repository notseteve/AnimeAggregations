  "description" : "He has no name, but narrates the situation in the illusionary world seen through Tomoya`s dream while referring to himself only as \"Me\" (boku). He had his body created by the girl out of garbage so that he can be with her. The body is about half the girl`s height. He can`t talk as he is created without a mouth, so relies on body language to communicate with the girl. This is Tomoya himself after his death. Ushio in the edge of death in the illusion told him to collect light orbs to create a miracle to save Nagisa, Ushio and himself from tragedy.",
