  "description" : "The previous Maou and mother of Wolfram, Conrad and Gwendal, each with different fathers. Although initially, Cecilie seems to be rather airheaded, she is actually very astute and intelligent and a very caring person. Having been replaced as the Maou by Yuuri, Cecilie takes advantage of her open schedule to hunt for men on her \"free and easy quest for love.\" She has displayed interest in Yuuri (though she remains one of the chief supporters in his engagement to her son, Wolfram), his older brother Shouri, and even her childhood friend Raven. At one time, she wanted to marry him, much to her brother`s chagrin. Cecilie is also quite powerful, and has admirable skill with the whip. When fighting, she has the uncanny ability to quickly dress in red leather and mask. This form and her skill tends to scare her enemies, and if they ever meet her the second time, they are usually unwilling to fight her again.",
