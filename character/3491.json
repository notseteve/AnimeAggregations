  "description" : "He is Patti and Liz`s meister and the Shinigami`s son. He is called Kid by his friends and family. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is represented as a complete obsession about everything being symmetrical and takes the idea of perfection to the extremes. To him, anything symmetrical is beautiful and if it is off by any measurement (a picture frame off by millimetre, or a pose that is slightly out of place), he will try to correct it right away, even if the situation calls for utmost attention. The biggest problem Kid has is with his hair because one side being completely black while the other has three white strips going across it. His hair was referred to by Mosquito as Sanzu Lines, and that since they have not connected Kid is not at full power, but with a reaction to BREW, Kid reattached the arm he lost to Mosquito and was shown to have one of the lines connect on the other side of his head. He also showcased new abilities, like upgrading the calibre of Kid`s shots from Patti and Liz from .38 to .42 and changing his guns to visually match the Israeli made Desert Eagle (which have the words Death Eagle engraved on them). Showing Kid anything that is too asymmetrical or mentioning his hair will send him into a state of massive depression (which normally takes encouragement from Patti and Liz to break). In the most extreme of cases, Kid will cough up blood and faint; this is usually set off by his hair being cut, or completely failing to make something symmetrical.",
