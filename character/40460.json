  "description" : "Clay`s Palpitoad was the second Pokémon Clay used to battle against Ash during his gym battle. Clay had just lost the first round and he wanted to make sure that Ash didn`t get carried away in the battle. Iris noted that Clay`s Palpitoad seemed to be stronger than Ash`s Palpitoad while Cilan noted that not only is Clay`s Palpitoad a Ground type but it`s also a Water type so the battle for Ash`s Oshawott would be a lot tougher.\nAsh decided to keep his Oshawott out to battle against Clay`s Palpitoad and right away it became evident that Clay`s Palpitoad was the stronger Pokémon as its Hydro Pump ended up being more powerful than Ash`s Oshawott Water Gun. Clay`s Palpitoad followed up with a Sludge Bomb that knocked Ash`s Oshawott`s scallsword out of its hand and just as it was retrieving it, it got hit by Clay`s Palpitoad`s Rock Smash and was knocked out.\nBattle against Ash`s Snivy\nAfter knocking out Ash`s Oshawott, Ash`s Snivy was sent out to replace it as Ash picked it because it was strong against both Ground and Water. Ash`s Snivy used Attract right at the beginning of their battle which prove to be an unexpected yet effective technique as Clay`s Palpitoad was unable to attack after the effects of Attract took hold of it. Ash`s Snivy pummeled Clay`s Palpitoad with effective Grass type attacks until it was knocked out.",
