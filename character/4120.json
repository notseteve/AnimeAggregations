  "description" : "Tsume is a rough, self-reliant wolf. In the past, he was part of a pack. However, one day his pack was attacked by Jaguara`s wolf hunting troops and many of his family and friends were killed. During the fight, Tsume attempted to flee, leaving all of his dead and dying brethren behind. Because of this, the rest of the pack cast him out, and the alpha attacked him, leaving him with a large X-shaped scar across his chest. From then on, Tsume was plagued with self-hatred and didn`t trust himself to be anyone`s friend. For years he did not talk to, get to know, or trust other wolves, and became the leader of a group of human thieves.",
