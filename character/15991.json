  "description" : "Chiri`s older sister and in contrast to her a complete slob who creates disarray and dirt by her mere presence. According to Harumi, Tane would not have been so dirty had it not been for Chiri. In a flashback, a young Chiri and Tane were shown with a pet goldfish. Chiri suggests cleaning the goldfish by pouring shampoo into the tank, which Tane tried convincing her not to. Tane then leaps into a pile of mud, which Nozomu understands as a way to suppress Chiri`s proper behaviour. Tane also expressed that if it were up to her, she would like to be able to dress up nicely and go on dates like a typical girl. Like some of the other girls in Nozomu`s class, Tane also develops a crush on him. Her name derives from the Japanese word kittanee (\"dirty\").",
