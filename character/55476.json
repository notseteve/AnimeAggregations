  "description" : "Asuka Mishima is Haruto`s ex-girlfriend and classmate. She is also a friend and neighbor of Haruto`s older sister, Aoi. She enters Haruto`s life after mistaking him for a burglar and subduing him with a baseball bat. Originally from Fukushima and possessed of a loud and fiery personality, Asuka eventually develops a crush on Haruto; her feelings eventually get through and they begin dating. Asuka is a compassionate girl and is forgiving of Haruto`s mistakes, such as when Haruto and Shiori Amaya were discovered walking out of a love hotel. Haruto is forced to explain what was he doing there, but he could not because Shiori has reasons to keep it a secret. Haruto then explains himself to Asuka and she forgives him, not asking about the details. Recently Asuka and Haruto have tried to make time to go on a trip together to move their relationship to the next stage but they have not been able to since Asuka had to return home to Fukushima to help with some family issues. Surprisingly, Asuka comes to Hiroshima to surprise Haruto, but discovers that he had gone to the summer festival with Yuzuki, where she had confessed to Haruto. After returning to Tokyo, the two break up.\nThe character design and name is likely a reference to Asuka Kazama from the Tekken games. The main story of Tekken is about the feuds between the members of the Mishima family.",
