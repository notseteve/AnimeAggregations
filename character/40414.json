It thought it could outfight the Tranquill but Misha`s Purrloin quickly ran away when the entire flock appeared. While running away from the flock, it ran into Meowth. Meowth instantly fell in love with Misha`s Purrloin and quickly took sides with it when the flock of Tranquill showed up. With the help of Ash`s Oshawott and Pikachu, the flock was turned away.\nMeowth began to confess its love to Misha`s Purrloin but was quickly interrupted by Ash`s Oshawott who was also attracted to Misha`s Purrloin. The two of them began competing for its attention not realizing that Misha`s Purrloin was a male and was just going along with the deception for its own protection. Misha`s Purrloin was about to leave the group but it then saw a lot of berries in Ash`s backpack and it decided to stay around.\nWhen Misha saw her Choroneko, she immediately recognized it and quickly went over to get it but Choroneko brought out its claws and looked as if it would hurt her if she attempted to go further. Meowth was able to translate what Misha`s Purrloin`s was saying and it indicated that it thought it had been abandoned. Misha explained to her Choroneko that she`d been injured and wasn`t able to return as quickly as she`d hoped.\nWhen Ash and his friend were beginning to fall into the rocks, Misha came over to help pull the rope with Cilan but the metal girthing collapsed below them and they fell in as well. Misha`s Purrloin went to get help from the flock of Tranquill and they were able to rescue everyone. Misha`s Purrloin had a change of heart and was reunited with Misha.",
