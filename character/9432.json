  "description" : "On the battlefield, Leena`s fighting style centers on one simple philosophy: shoot, shoot, shoot. Originally piloting a heavily-armed Dibison, she trades it in for a very customized Gun Sniper. Rather than using it in its traditional long-range role, she fits a Weasel Unit onto it, loading it with a massive number of missile launchers. Good thing. Her usual solution to a problem situation is to order Total Assault: firing everything she`s got.",
