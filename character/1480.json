  "description" : "Born Jiro Yamada (an average name, similar to John Doe or John Smith in English), he insisted that Gai Daigoji was \"the name that belongs to (his) soul\", and angrily asserted his \"true\" name whenever someone used the \"other\" one. A rabid Gekiganger otaku, he was an official pilot and arrived three days ahead of schedule when he learned they would be piloting actual robots like in the anime. Fuelled by his devotion to the show, Gai had a fierce intensity in and out of battle, and was angry and resentful towards Akito for being the first one to engage the enemy, stealing \"(his) destiny\", even though he had a broken leg and was unable to fight. The two were soon able to bond over Gekiganger, although Gai couldn`t understand why Akito would rather be \"a dumb cook\" than a robot pilot.",
