  "description" : "Born in Hong Kong and raised in Japan. Murata Ken met Yuuri in middle school, where they were in the same class for two years. He now goes to a famous private school. His name is similar to Yuuri`s favorite historical drama actor Matsudaira Ken, so he is the only one of Yuuri`s former classmates that he remembers the name and face of other than baseball club members. Ken is known to smile often and keep relatively quiet. He often tells jokes which don`t suit his age which makes Yuuri ask \"how old are you really?\".\nDr. Rodriguez was responsible for handling his soul, around the same time when Conrad transported Julia`s soul.\nHe is the reincarnation of the Great Sage. The double black tactician and strategist to the Original King of Shin Makoku. He remembers parts of the past lives he has had over the past 4000 years. Other people in the story don`t seem to remember any of their past lives, so his remembering some seems to be very special. Because of his past lives he is able to speak Shin Makoku`s language, English and French. His parents are always busy with work so he is home alone a lot. He also spends a lot of time with Yuuri`s family.",
