  "description" : "In My-HiME, Nao is a middle school student at Fuka Academy and the roommate of Mai Tokiha`s friend Aoi. Although she first appears in the second episode, when a rampaging Mikoto Minagi knocks her down, she is not formally introduced until the seventh, as Mikoto`s classmate. At first, she appears to be a child prostitute as she approaches a man who had arranged to meet her over the Internet (where she uses the nickname \"Juliet\") and they go to a secluded spot. However, before things go any further, she traps the man with the aid of her \"Child\" familiar and robs him.",
