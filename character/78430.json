  "description" : "Shauna`s Ivysaur is the evolved form of Shauna`s Bulbasaur. It evolved sometime after the Hiyoku Tripokalon Tournament. To help Serena`s Eevee overcome its shyness and to learn how to battle, Shauna`s Ivysaur teamed up with it in a tag battle against Ash and Tierno. The battle was cut short though as Serena got an idea for a new performance and wanted to practice it immediately.",
