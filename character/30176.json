  "description" : "Kriemhild Gretchen is the witch form of Kaname Madoka. She appears in the fourth timeline of Episode 10 as a mountain-sized creature. Her name was not shown during initial broadcast, but was added in a Nicovideo broadcast version one week later.\nNothing is known about the specifics of her powers or personality, but her formation in the second timeline involves thunderclouds coalescing into a giant humanoid (the name is not shown then, however, and thus it is not known whether that witch is also called Kriemhild Gretchen). According to Kyuubey, her strength in the fourth timeline is of such a magnitude that she could obliterate the planet within ten days.\nSource: Puella Magi Wiki",
