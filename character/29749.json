  "description" : "Flanders is an android built by Emil. Somewhat a different representation of Flandre, it is a butler robot that is many times bigger and has a mechanical appearance. Its real form is that of a diminutive non-human looking robot butler while its giant form is a robot suit. Like all the androids it can only say fuga. In Chapter 56, Princess Destiny, it was noted that Flanders had broken down sometime ago, signaling that Emil has died from his illness.",
