  "description" : "The Shinpaku Rengou is a group of fighters created by Niijima Haruo in order to facilitate his goal of world domination. The name comes from the first characters in Niijima (新) and Shirahama (白). The alliance is first introduced in episode 21 of the anime, when Niijima comes to Ken`ichi`s rescue in his fight against Kisara`s group. The Alliance is composed mostly of students from Kouryou High and converted former members of Ragnarok. Following Odin`s defeat and the subsequent dissolution of Ragnarok, the Shinpaku Alliance is able to cement its reputation as the strongest fighter group in town.\nIn the YOMI arc, the Shinpaku Alliance participates in the D of D Tournament and manages to reach the final round of the Chi group. However, because of the injuries sustained by its core fighter members throughout the tournament and their final opponent being Shou Kanou, the Alliance chooses to forfeit the match.\nThe Alliance initially used Kouryou High`s physics laboratory as a make-shift base, but as the organization grew, it moved to Kisara`s former base. After the D of D tournament, Niijima officially rented the building, telling Kisara`s dad that they were trying to save her from the world of delinquents.\nYami and YOMI consider the Shinpaku Alliance part of Ryouzanpaku.",
