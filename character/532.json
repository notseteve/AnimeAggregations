The experience gained does mean, however, that he of all characters possesses the most extensive practical knowledge as to how the world operates. Hayate`s dad has refused to get employed,while his mother is a compulsive gambler, and the whereabouts of Hayate`s older brother who is not named, are unknown. These events led to their bankruptcy - they abandon Hayate after selling his organs to the Yakuza to ease their financial burdens. With not many choices left to him, Hayate conspired to kidnap someone to get ransom money. He found a girl, http://anidb.net/ch528 [Sanzenin Nagi], and told her that he would kidnap her. However, Nagi mistook his words for his confession of love, so later he was employed as Nagi`s new butler but as the story progresses, Hayate began to like Nagi without realising it. In the beginning of the story he often mentioned Nello and Patrasche from the novel A Dog of Flanders and compared his miserable situation to the characters` life.",
