  "description" : "Asa is a senior attending Verbana Academy and is in her last year of high school. This makes her at least 1 year older than Rin and Kaede and is good friends with both of them, having met when they met her while she was in Junior High. Taking Kaede under her wing, she trained Kaede to be an excellent cook like herself and as time passed by she would teach her some new recipes to try out for Rin. At the moment she currently lives with her mother. From time to time she`ll flirt with Rin, tease him, and give him a nice big slap on the back. However, it was later revealed that there were numerous guys who had a secret crush on her. Nevertheless, nothing much came out of it as she rejected them and the show didn`t delve any deeper into the issue.",
