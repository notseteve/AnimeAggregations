During magic training, there was an accident causing gems to merge with her flesh. She has grown cautious of magic, though that has not stopped her from opening a magic shop in England. Angelica is married, to an unnamed man, and their daughter is Alucia.\nShe has formed a familiar bond with a Vodanoi-type of water fairy, http://anidb.net/ch84228 [Hugo]. She also has other neighbors in her shop, suggesting she has the assistance of more than just Hugo.\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki, edited.",
