She works in the Control Section as the supervisor of the debris Section. She has lived in space for three years.\nShe was given the nickname Swan by Gigalt because swans look all elegant and graceful as they glide along the water, but under the water their legs are paddling away like crazy. Clair pushes herself too hard.",
