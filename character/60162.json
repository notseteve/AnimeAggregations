  "description" : "Marika transfers to Raku`s class and is introduced as his fianc√©e; she bears a key that she thinks will unlock Raku`s pendant, and is the most vocal about expressing her love to Raku. She is the daughter of the police chief, and has been in love with Raku for the past ten years. She does not get along with Chitoge; she states she hates girls with long hair despite the fact that she also has long hair. She has a frail constitution; ten years prior, she was frequently visited by a young Raku, who brought her gifts and sparked a friendship with her. She used to speak in a rather vulgar manner, but has attempted to correct her language after Raku had told her that he likes a girly girl with long hair. However, when flustered, she reverts to her old speaking habits.\nSource: Wiki",
