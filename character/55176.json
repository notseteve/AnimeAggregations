  "description" : "Meruem (メルエム) is the Chimera Ant King and the most powerful of the Queen`s offspring. Forcing himself out the womb at the cost of the Queen`s life, Meruem is arrogant with little sense of identity aside from his supposed destiny and preconceived notions of his kind`s superiority over humans. Meruem leaves N.G.L. with his Royal Guards in search of a place to establish his colony, taking over the Republic of East Gorteau. Pitou uses the corpse of its dictator Ming Jol-ik to order a mandatory gathering of the entire population for a national rally, so they can secretly sort to find Nen users who will be used as food. They will also use Pitou`s ability to manipulate the people, forming an army of soldiers under their control. The Hunter Association mobilizes an extermination team to infiltrate the East Gorteau palace and assassinate Meruem, composed of a selected team of professional Hunters.\nSource: Wikipedia",
