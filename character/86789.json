  "description" : "Kartana is a dual-type Grass/Steel Pokémon.\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nIt is one of the Ultra Beasts and is known by the code name UB-04 Blade.\nKartana is a small, humanoid Pokémon that resembles origami. It has a mainly white body with a red underside, with its head seemingly folded inside of its body. Its head has a four-sided star in the center with two horns or antennas protruding from the top, with no discernible eyes or other facial features. It has long, paper-thin arms that resemble katanas, which connect to the center of its body within a yellow sheath-like area. It has three yellow protrusions by the sheath, and its legs appear creased. It is completely flat, as if it were made entirely out of paper.\nDespite its small size compared to the other Ultra Beasts, Kartana is extremely dangerous, as every edge of its body is impossibly sharp. It is able to cut down a gigantic steel tower with one stroke of the blades on its arms, and any opponents that try to attack it will be similarly cut down. Its light, paper-like body allows it to evade most attacks by simply floating out of the way, but it also makes it highly vulnerable to fire and moisture. Kartana is the only Pokémon that can learn Cut by leveling up.",
