A calm person, he is popular with the female students of the school, but shows romantic interest in Tokiha Mai. Reito`s calm and reserved personality often clashes with that of Executive Committee head Suzushiro Haruka, whose annoyance with him is made evident several times. Reito shows kindness by taking Mai`s brother Takumi and his roommate Akira with him on official business to a fancy restaurant free of charge.",
