  "description" : "Cocytus is the Guardian of the 5th Floor of Nazarick.\nCocytus is the personal creation of Warrior Takemikazuchi, one of the 41 members of Ainz Ooal Gown. Cocytus was created to personify the perfect warrior both in body and spirit. Cocytus is loyal to a fault to the Supreme Beings but he`s not just a dumb muscle and is willing to learn in to better serve his lord. Amongst the denizen of Nazarick, he`s more accepting of outsiders provided they share the same strength, honor, and warrior spirit that he epitomizes.\nCocytus design is based on the Gelugon, a type of ice-devil from D&D. He has the highest offensive capabilities of melee fighters in Nazarick backed up by ice-elemental skills. Cocytus have no need for armor as his exoskeleton serves as a living armor. His creator, Warrior Takemikazuchi, has equipped Cocytus with many of his own personally crafted weapons and has programmed Cocytus with the knowledge of all of the Divine Weapons own by the Supreme Beings.\nCocytus seems to prefer the company of other insectoids like him from Nazarick. He also hold good relations with Demiurge and often asks the demon for advice too difficult for himself to understand.",
