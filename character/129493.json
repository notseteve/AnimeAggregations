  "description" : "Professor Burnet contacted Professor Kukui when she was trapped by a group of Jangmo-o and Hakamo-o near the entrance to the Altar of the Sunne. It carried Professor Kukui over the Pokémon so he could be by her side help deal with them. He instructed Braviary to use Brave Bird which hit all 8 Pokémon.\nIn the Alola League Exhibition Match, Ash switched from Torracat to Lycanroc and the Professor Kukui soon switched to Braviary, and the battle heated up even more. Lycanroc used Bite and grabbed on to Braviary`s foot but Braviary flew 800 yards into the air and then crashed Lycanroc to the ground to do major damage. Lycanroc was still standing after the Sky Drop as it is one tough Pokémon but Superpower proved to be too much and Ash`s Lycanroc (Dusk Form) was defeated.\nAsh`s Rowlet was the next opponent to face Braviary and the match turned into an aerial battle with Braviary’s chasing Rowlet and using Steel Wing at the same time. While up in the air, Rowlet continuously used Seed Bomb and it had Braviary completely at its command for quite awhile until a Steel Wing has finally connected. Rowlet used Brave Bird and defeated Braviary.",
