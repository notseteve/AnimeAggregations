  "description" : "Gottn Goh was a member of the Axis Neo Zeon movement serving as an executive officer aboard the Endra under the respective command of Mashymre Cello and Chara Soon during their individual tenures as commander of the Endra. He was noticeably calmer than the two commanders he served under, though prone to bouts of emotion when he was reciprocated with similar loyalty. Perhaps because he was at best a mediocre pilot Gottn preferred combat tactics that relied on traps, ambushes, and other surprises.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
