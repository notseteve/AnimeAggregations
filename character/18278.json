  "description" : "Known to the villains as Black Wind or Kaze, this silent, expressionless man defeats monsters once he thaws the `Magun` on his right arm, which fires summons. All of his memories of the past have been lost, and he walks through life without knowing who or what he is. The only thing he is sure about in his life is his fight with Makenshi, longing to settle things finished between them.",
