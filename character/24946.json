At the military gala case they helped Rangui to stop the Ministry of Spirit Affairs members to interfere in her plans and in episode 8 they have captured Suskihotaru and Agemaki and locked them in an earthen cellar to lure Zakuro to a trap. They envy Zakuro for growing up in a happy home, they envy that Zakuro has people to love and protect, and they envy her freedom.\nSource: Wiki",
