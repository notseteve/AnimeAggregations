  "description" : "Ai Hayakawa is the daughter of Joe and Marie Hayakawa, who travelled to Wonderland with her younger (said because she is more mature, they are actually the same age) twin brother, Yu, in search of their lost parents. She is an energetic and intensely curious little girl who is very positive and outgoing. But, her good moods don`t last too long. Ai loves creepy, cute things like her gift from Fabula, Poshepocket, with whom she fell in love with at first sight.",
