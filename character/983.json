  "description" : "They are found in the from the Hoenn Region, and evolves to Swalot. It has a puddle-like appearance and a yellow leaf on what can only be described as its head. Gulpin has a big appetite and a deceptively small looking mouth. Its body is all stomach. As a Poison-type, it employs many moves of that type, including Toxic and Sludge, which may be better suited to Grimer and Muk than to Gulpin. Its name may be a shortening of \"gulping\" or the joining of \"gulp\" and \"in\", referring to \"gulp in\".",
