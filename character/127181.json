  "description" : "Dozer is a Great Class competitor in the World Coronation Series who challenged Ash Ketchum to a battle at the Rock Tunnel entrance in the Kanto region. He was very impressed with Ash`s Farfetch`d muscles and how it was able to break up rocks with its leak.\nHe and his Gurdurr have worked hard to build up their frames into tip-top shape, which makes them as trained-up as they could get. Despite their training, he lost the battle to Ash Ketchum after Ash`s Farfetch`d broke through the girder. Ash Ketchum ranking went up from 415 to 381 as a result of winning the battle.",
