  "description" : "The eighth Angel, Sandalphon, is similar in form to the aquatic Cambrian predator Anomalocaris. It appears to have no abilities beyond its extraordinary resistance to heat and pressure, up to the point of being able to open its mouth in magma. Its own AT field was never strong enough to physically manifest. Its core was never depicted.\nSandalphon was discovered in an embryonic state deep inside the Mount Asama volcano. Nerv was determined to take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to strike first against an Angel. Asuka, in Unit 02, was sent to capture the Angel using a special electromagnetic cage. The Eva`s normal B-type equipment was not designed for extreme environments, so Unit 02 was equipped with the D-type Equipment, specifically designed for extreme conditions like magma. During the operation the Angel awoke, rapidly developed into its adult form, and attacked Unit 02, damaging it, however Unit 02 could not take any countermeasure due to the fact that it had lost its progressive knife earlier from the pressure of the lava (It was sent over the depth limit of the D-type equipment). Sandalphon was defeated by Asuka using the D-type equipment`s coolant (inspired by an earlier conversation with Shinji regarding thermal expansion) and Unit 01`s progressive knife.",
