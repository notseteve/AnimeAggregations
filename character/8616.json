  "description" : "Yamanaka Ino is the only female member of Team 10. She has known Haruno Sakura since they were children, befriending and helping her to develop her own identity. When they discovered that they both liked Uchiha Sasuke, Sakura ended their friendship so they could properly compete for his affection. The two eventually make amends and rekindle their friendship, but still maintain a competitive attitude towards each other. In the anime, when Sakura begins to excel in healing techniques, Ino becomes her surrogate apprentice, hoping to be more useful to her friends and teammates as an able medical ninja. In terms of combat abilities, Ino specializes in mind-altering techniques. To use these techniques, Ino transfers her consciousness to her target`s mind, gaining control over their body which she can then use to attack others.",
