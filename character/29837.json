  "description" : "When Char Aznable returns from a trip to the Earth Federation capital in Dakar, he brings with him a pair of orphaned children, who remain aboard the Argama as mascots and comic relief. For the most part, Shinta and Qum are entrusted to the care of their babysitter Fa Yuiry and their pet robot Haro, but when they`re really bored they`ll pester Kamille, Bright, or the kindly ship`s doctor Hasan for additional entertainment.\nSource: Official Site",
