  "description" : "Grandpa Hino is Hino Rei`s grandpa. In the anime, he is ... goofy. Consequently, he and Usagi get along very well. He energetically encourages temple visitors to buy lucky charms, make wishes, pray, etc. Rei gets very worried about him because he is very junpy and physical for a man his age. But despite his goofiness, he does manage to come down to Earth when the situation warrants it.",
