  "description" : "Rosette`s contractor and assistant. In the past Chrono has helped Aion in his fight for freedom from Pandemonium. However, when Aion told Chrono to kill Mary of Magdalene, he refused because of his love for her. As a result, Chrono betrayed Aion. 50 years later, he met Rosette and fell in love with her as well. For this reason he is highly protective of her. Since he lost his horns to Aion in a fight he formed a contract with Rosette and is feeding off her soul as an alternative to the astral energy he would be getting from his horns. Chrono was once part of Aion`s six-member team.\n(Wikipedia)",
