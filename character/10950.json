  "description" : "The sly, suspicious Kycilia is Degwin Zabi`s only known daughter. She is the commander of Zeon`s Mobile Assault Force, based at the lunar city of Granada, and also the direct superior of her brother Garma. Kycilia is a clever and innovative tactician, and the driving force behind Zeon`s mobile suit and mobile armour development. However, her rivalry with her brothers increasingly undermines Zeon`s efforts to hold its own against the resurgent Earth Federation.",
