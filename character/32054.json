  "description" : "Cathy Taymor is introduced in episode 34 during Season Two [Episodes 27-51] as the Writer and Director of \"Salome In Vegas;\" an Off-Broadway Stage-play starring Layla Hamilton. She is also presented as Layla`s \"New Career Partner\" who gave her the desire to perform once again after Layla exits Kaleido Stage due to an injury. Although she initially introduces herself kindly during Sora`s second one week leisure from Kaleido Stage; Cathy Taymor`s character is a fast-talking-fast-paced-brash-and-outspoken 30-something fireball of energy! Cathy`s relationship with Layla as her \"New Partner\" emotionally distresses Sora at first. Later in the series, much like with Simon Park [Episode 17], Karlos once again outsources an experienced Director to mentor Kaelido Stage`s budding Writer and Director Mia Guillem. This experienced Director is Cathy.\nDuring production of \"Romeo And Juliet\" Mia Guillem falls in love with Cathy`s direct and take-no-prisoner`s-style and begins to look up to Cathy as her mentor. Later during the production of \"Swan Lake\" Cathy and Mia become close and trusting friends and together come up with amazing ideas for Kaleido Star`s version of \"Swan Lake\". Cathy is not presented in the series until after Leon Oswald and May Wong are theatrically introduced and Rosetta decides to join Kaleido Stage. Although Cathy`s introduction is somewhat more subtle in the second season of Kaleido Stage; Cathy is an important character who inspires and motivates nearly every character either directly or indirectly in Kaleido Stage.",
