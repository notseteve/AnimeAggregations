  "description" : "Louise Françoise le Blanc de La Vallière, the heroine of the series, is a student at the Tristain Magical Academy. She earned the sobriquet Zero Louise because of her ineptness at magic, and was frequently the butt of jokes among her classmates. On the day that all students at her level were to summon their magical familiars, she performs the rite, but instead of the usual magical creatures, unexpectedly summons a Japanese teenager, http://anidb.net/ch4052 [Hiraga Saito], who, being inscribed with the runes of a familiar, reluctantly assumes that role.\n[SPOILER]It turns out that her ineptitude at normal magic is because she is actually a very rare Void Mage, and normal magical training does not cover that.[/SPOILER]\nShe is named after Louise Françoise de la Baume le Blanc de La Vallière (1644-1710), one of the most famous Maîtresses-en-titre of Louis XIV.",
