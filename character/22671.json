  "description" : "There were many strange occurances in the city of Trovitopolis where several members of the public had their food stolen from them, leading people to beleive that the city`s sewers was housing a monster. In addition, Ash mentioned to the mayor that his Bulbasaur had got kidnapped in the city`s sewers and the mayor replied that he was sending his personal SWAT team to hunt the monster down to stop it from terrorising the city.\nJessie, James and Meowth had just been spooked by the \"monster\" in the sewers and thought that if they made themselves looked scary they could spook the monster in return. However, instead of running into the monster they actually ran into the SWAT team who mistook them for the real monster. The SWAT team fired their glue guns on Jessie, James and Meowth and returned to the surface.\nIt emerged that the `monster` was actually a Bulbasaur which the mayor had long abandoned because it would not evolve. Due to his previous cruel acts the city folk refused to re-elect the major and his Bulbasaur was looked after in the nearby Pok√©centrer.",
