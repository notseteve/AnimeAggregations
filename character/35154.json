  "description" : "Sugisaki Ayano is a student at Kaimei High School and a genius violinist. As a child she was an introvert, but upon seeing a violin performance on TV was taken by a desire to play the instrument and soon enrolled in lessons. She has very little confidence in her own abilities, resulting in her being hesitant about going abroad to study music in Germany. Though she originally decided not to, the Sket Dan`s performance at the Kaimei Rock Festival gave her the courage to go through with it.",
