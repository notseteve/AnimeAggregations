  "description" : "Toxapex is a dual-type Poison/Water Pok√©mon.\nIt evolves from Mareanie starting at level 38.\nToxapex is a primarily blue coloured Pokemon resembling a starfish. Its main body is very small, compared to its tentacles, which are used for its motion. Toxapex`s main body is mostly suspended in mid-air due to the length of its tentacles. The body is primarily purple coloured, and becomes blue where it connects to the tentacles. Toxapex has blue eyes with orange sclerae and black irises. It has yellow coloured teeth. It`s main body ends mid-air with purple triangular protrusions in all directions.\nToxapex has 12 tentacles as compared to its pre-evolution`s 10. These have also grown in size. They are primarily blue, with two large spikes in the middle, an orange spike at the top, and two orange spikes near the endings, each. The inner potion of these tentacles is purple with two pink spikes each. When the inner spikes are present, the outer spikes sink back into its tentacles, and vice versa. The main body of Toxapex becomes invisible when all these tentacles are closed, more resembling a hemisphere in this state.",
