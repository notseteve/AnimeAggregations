  "description" : "Asougi Rin is the protagonist of the series. Her appearance is that of someone in her twenties but her real age is unknown. In episode six, she says she has been looking for Tajimamori for a thousand years, making her at least a millennium old. She usually wears a black suit and glasses. Her whimsical personality serves as a front for a cunning, ruthless mind and extraordinary martial art skills. She always keeps a number of throwing blades and a garrote wire concealed on her body. At some point in the past, a \"Fruit of Time\" (also known as a \"time spore\") entered Rin`s body, effectively making her immortal, unable to age, and capable of surviving and regenerating from a phenomenal amount of bodily damage. In episode four, she is sucked inside a running jet engine and regenerates her entire body over 25 years, albeit at the cost of all her memories (they return when she is briefly killed by Laura). In episode five, Apos removes Rin`s time spore, seemingly killing her just like Sayara and Maeno before, but it is revealed in episode six that an immortal`s death is not permanent as long as her time spore remains intact. Rin`s time spore is then brought to Apos` castle, where its proximity to Yggdrasil, the fabled source of all time spores, speeds up her revival, which would have normally taken many decades. She and Mimi run the detective business Asougi Consulting together in West Shinjuku until their office is demolished in episode four.",
