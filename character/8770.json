  "description" : "Kousaka Shigure is a mysterious person and a slow talker. She is also a master of all types of weapons and believes that weaponry should be seen as an extension of the body: simply relying on the weapons strength alone will not make you a master of it. She was initially viewed as a loner, often avoiding interaction with the other residents of the dojo, besides Apachai. However, later in the series, she begins to open up to Ken`ichi and the others, and even partakes in certain daily rituals (e.g. dinner) with them. She teaches Ken`ichi how to use weapons and also got him past his fear of people using weapons against him.",
