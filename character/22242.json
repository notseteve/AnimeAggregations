  "description" : "The second ship of the Izumo class, which was created to travel between the resource satellite Heliopolis, and the Orb homeland. Only the Kusanagi`s central module travels in and out of Earth`s atmosphere, and once in orbit it docks with the other modules to form a full-sized warship. Created by Morgenroete, this ship is similar in design to the Archangel, with lower firepower but a far greater mobile suit carrying capacity. When the Orb Union falls to the Earth Alliance, the Kusanagi carries Cagalli Yula Athha and her comrades into space, and it goes on to become the mothership of Orb`s remaining M1 Astray mobile suit forces.",
