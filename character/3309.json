  "description" : "Nanami is the third-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family, and she usually helps Hazuki with her work, but is more commonly found by Mika`s side along with helping and joining in on her spying missions. She has a friendly personality and smiles a lot, though also has a wicked tongue. She is seen wearing sunglasses often. Like Hazuki, she also often appears out of no where, though holding a large hammer. She has a habit of driving extremely fast, but Hazuki just states she is a great driver when one is in a hurry.",
