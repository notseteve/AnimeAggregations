  "description" : "A real 10 year old girl with differently coloured eyes. It`s a mystery how she was born because Mars hadn`t produced any children for a decade. She accompanies Layla everywhere, and is the only person or thing the stoic Layla seems to care for. Layla saw through Nei`s disguise because she`d been living outside the domed cities for so long, in the wild. Nei had been acting like a doll so she wouldn`t cause any trouble or attract attention to herself. Nei follows Layla because she can act like herself and not like a doll.",
