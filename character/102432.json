  "description" : "Pikachu went up to befriend all of Pikarla`s Pikachu in the valley but they put their guard up and it wasn`t till Kurin, a bold female Pikachu approached Pikachu. She and the rest of Pikarla`s Pikachu misinterpreted Ash`s Pikachu initial greeting as flirting and left it.\nIt can be easily recognized, as she has very curly bangs, so Pikarla called it Curly-chan because of that. It later came back and touched tails with Ash`s Pikachu to which Hoshi and Pikarla believed that Ash`s Pikachu gave her butterflies because it was now glossy and more appealing to her.\nWhen Rocket Gang attacked, it was captured by them but Pikarla`s Pikachu (Boss) used the Z-move Catastropika to on them and Jessie`s Mimikyu to send the Rocket`s flying while releasing all the Pikachu at the same time. After being rescued by Pikarla`s Pikachu (Boss), she fell in love with him.\nThis Pikachu is voiced by Nicole Fujita who was voice acting for the very first time.",
