  "description" : "The first real witch introduced in the series. She is nothing more than a kid witch that is not very good at magic, which is the reason Mifune is protecting her. In the past she was often being kidnapped by Mafia families. Mifune, who was working for the Mafia boss Marlon was sent to kill her but he betrayed his boss by `kidnapping` her instead as to protect her. She cares for Mifune and calls anyone that fights with him a bully (even if he started the fight). Her animal theme seems to be chameleons due to her hat`s appearance and the entrance of her castle. The only magic she has shown is partial invisibility.",
