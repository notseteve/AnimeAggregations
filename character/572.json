  "description" : "A mute with a nearly uncanny resemblance to Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen. Hayashida claimed that as long as he attended, Cromartie would be the \"Olympics for delinquents\". Although he never speaks and people assume he is a mute, Freddie actually has a good singing voice and the only occasion people can hear his voice is when he sings, (as seen in manga episode of Mechazawa`s birthday.) The bottom of the microphone stand is broken, referring to Freddie Mercury`s gimmick. He also rides to school on an incredibly large, incredibly powerful, possibly wild horse named Kokuryu (a reference to Raoh`s horse in Fist of the North Star), which waits outside the bathroom while he`s \"doing his business\".",
