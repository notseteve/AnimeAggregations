  "description" : "The Third Neck, he is one of the first Orochi to attack the Miko. He is a very large man with heavy chains hanging off him, which he uses as weapons. He is attracted to Himeko and wishes to go on a date with her, which only fuels Chikane`s jealous protectiveness of the Solar Miko. Girochi is said to be Miyako`s younger brother.\nIn a flashback scene, he is shown in a scene of destruction as a young boy, crying near a body crushed under a collapsed building. Presumably, the same war that destroyed his sister`s church claimed the life of their parents and left Girochi traumatized and disillusioned.\nHis mecha, Hi no Ashinazuchi, is nicknamed Gungal, and it is characterized by an excessively large right arm â€” so large that the entire mech`s body can fit inside it when he uses it as a weapon (the \"Megaton Knuckle\" attack).\nHe carries the mark of Orochi on the back of his right hand.",
