  "description" : "Prince Soma Asman Kadar is a sixteen-year-old Indian prince. Unlike Ciel, he is spoiled and uses his parent`s fortune for his personal needs and blames all of his problems on others. He bestowed his affections on Meena, a beautiful maidservant who had served at his palace in India since his birth. He saw her as an older sister. However, she came to hate him due to his arrogance and ran away to England with Lord Harold West, a trader in Indian goods, wanting to be a rich wife, rather than an ordinary cook bound to her social class. During the course of his time in England, Soma begins to see things in a different perspective, realizing that he is blaming problems he caused on others. After learning Meena hated him for his ignorance, Prince Soma decided to stay with Ciel and learn how to act as a gentleman and even proclaims to be Ciel`s best friend. He does not know that Meena and Lord West were both killed by Ranmao on Lau`s orders after they lost the curry contest and were planning to try again. Shortly after, Ciel has him and Agni manage his property in London, in order to keep them out of his way.",
