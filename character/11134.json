  "description" : "This huge, two-legged mobile armor is transferred to Zeon`s space fortress Solomon just before the Federation Forces launch their assault. In addition to one large and 28 small mega particle cannon, the Big Zam is outfitted with an I-field barrier that deflects all enemy beam weapons. With Space Attack Force commander Dozle Zabi at its helm, the Big Zam wreaks havoc upon the Federation`s space fleet, until the Gundam defeats its protective barrier by attacking it at point-blank range.",
