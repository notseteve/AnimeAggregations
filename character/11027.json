  "description" : "This Pegasus-class mobile assault carrier, the besieged home of our crew of young heroes, is the first Earth Federation warship designed to carry mobile suits into battle. Its decks can hold up to nine mobile suits and fighters, and its armament includes a main gun turret, two mega particle cannons, a battery of missile launchers, and countless anti-aircraft guns. Thanks to its Minovsky craft system, the White Base can survive the heat of atmospheric re-entry, and then float effortlessly across the surface of the Earth. The soldiers of the Principality of Zeon, unaware of its true name, give the White Base the nickname \"Trojan Horse.\"",
