  "description" : "Creed Diskenth is the leader of the group and a former member of Chronos. He greatly admires the assassin side of Train, as the only person in the world he can relate his personality.\nAfter Train changes during his meetings with Saya, Creed kills Saya, and makes it his goal to return Train to his previous lifestyle and have him join the Apostles. He tells the group that their only purpose is destroy Chronos, but he really plans to make himself immortal using nanomachines and rule the world forever by selectivity controlling the human population. He is severely warped after being abused by his mother, whom he kills, and the police while living on the streets.Creed uses his Tao powers to manipulate the hilt of his former sword, \"Kotetsu\", to form the \"Imagine Blade.\" It`s first form, Level 1, is an invisible sword that is able to extend up to eighty meters. It later evolves into Level 2, a living black sword with a mouth that is directly linked with Creed`s mind. It is able to extend and be manipulated like a whip at will, and it can bite opponents. Level 3 merges the sword with his arm, and another large arm extends from it, which can be used to propel Creed at high speeds. Its final form, Level MAX, creates an extremely large blade made out of light. After obtaining the God`s Breath nanomachines, he becomes able to regenerate from any fatal wound in seconds and he will remain in his peak physical condition forever. Their only weakness is that they cannot fully restore the brain, which would leave him with only primal instincts.",
