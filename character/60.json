  "description" : "Pidgeot, known as the Bird Pokémon, is a bird-like Pokémon, whose original name in the English beta version of Pokémon Red and Blue was \"Pidgeott\", is the fully grown and developed form of the Pidgey species evolution line. In the main Pokémon game series, a Pidgeot is only acquired when a Pidgeotto grows past experience level 36 and is evolved into a Pidgeot. Pidgeot are large, powerful birds admired for their glossy plumage and their battling ability. With their powerful chest muscles at work, Pidgeot can flap their wings fast enough to whip up gusts of winds to rival tornadoes. Pidgeot are very aerodynamic, capable of soaring to an altitude of 3300 feet and reaching speeds of up to Mach 2. Like Pidgeotto, Pidgeot feed on Magikarp by swooping from the sky and snatching them out of the water with their talons. Pidgeot appear very similar to Pidgeotto, so much so that one has been easily mistaken for the other, even by official sources.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolves into a Pidgeot near the end of the Kanto saga, and remained in Pallet Town to watch over a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto while Ash went off to the Orange Islands.",
