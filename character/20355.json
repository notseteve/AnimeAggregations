  "description" : "Dearka Elsman is an arrogant pilot of ZAFT`s Rau Le Creuset team who looks down on Naturals. He was part of the crew that invaded Heliopolis to steal mobile suits and piloted the GAT-X103 Buster. During the course of the series, Dearka is captured by the Archangel where he meets Kira`s friends which prompt him to change his opinions about Naturals. Seeing how both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT had become controlled by genocidal individuals such as Muruta Azrael and Patrick Zala, Dearka retakes his Buster and fights alongside the Archangel. During the SEED series, Dearka begins a relationship with Miriallia Haw which ends shortly after. In Gundam SEED Destiny, Dearka is shown in a regular ZAFT soldier uniform. His seiyu is Akira Sasanuma and his English voice actor is Brad Swaile.",
