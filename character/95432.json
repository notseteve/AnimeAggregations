  "description" : "The Baharuth Empire, commonly referred to as The Empire, is a human nation located to the east of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick]. It was once a feudal state, like the http://anidb.net/ch95431 [Re-Estize Kingdom], until the current Emperor established an absolute monarchy by purging many of the nobles. Under his rule, the Empire continues to gain more and more prosperity. The Empire also annually wares war with the Re-Estize Kingdom. However, these invasions are merely meant to slowly weaken the Kingdom while the Empire waits for the opportunity to conquer it with minimal losses.\nThe Empire became the first nation to make official contact with Nazarick. Fearing the power of its inhabitants, the Emperor chose to accept it as an independent nation while attempting to rally other human nations against it. However, this never came to be, as everyone became terrified of Nazarick`s military might. Afterwards, the Emperor submitted to Nazarick, causing the Empire to become its first vassal state.\nSource: Wikipedia",
