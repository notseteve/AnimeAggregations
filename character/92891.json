  "description" : "Cursch Lulu is the wife of http://anidb.net/ch92892 [Zaryusu Shasha] and acting Chieftain of the Red Eyes tribe. She is an albino, which normally would entail abandonment at birth, but she was kept and raised by her parents. She is powerful magic user.\nDuring a famine, her father, the chief, committed fratricide to prevent the death of his people. Unable to bear the shame, Cursch, arranged an uprising, which was successful, passing the mantle of chief to her. She and Zaryusu met when he came to ask for an alliance between lizardmen, and they fell in love, when he, while infatuated by her beauty, let out a mating cry for her. They eventually became closer and marry and even had a son, who was also an albino.\nShe became a representative for the lizard people, after the fight against http://anidb.net/ch72779 [Cocytus]. She met http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz], talked to him with fear and respect, and he offered to bring back Zaryusu in return for her acting as an informant to him, for any sign of rebellion. She is the most powerful magic caster among the lizardmen, but due to her skin, she is extremely vulnerable to the sun, making her wear a ridiculous bush outfit whenever she goes out in the day. She is still fearful of Ainz, as when he inquires about the child she fears he might take him away.\nSource: Wikipedia",
