  "description" : "Rosebay is a Pokémon ornithologist. When Ash and his friends encounter her, she is in the process of observing the bird Pokémon in a forest between Jubilife and Oreburgh. She allows them to join her for a while, and shows them a Swablu nest in a nearby tree. Dawn notes the lack of any actual Swablu nearby, and Rosebay says the number of bird Pokémon in the forest has recently dropped very significantly, though she has no idea why.\nUsing her binoculars, she`s able to ascertain that the bird Pokémon seem to disappear as they fly through a nearby valley. Along with Ash and the others, she heads there to investigate, and notices a giant trap set up by Team Rocket to catch the birds as they fly through. After the trap has been destroyed, the captive birds freed, and Team Rocket sent blasting off, she bids the group farewell.",
