  "description" : "Happy is a 6-year-old talking cat with blue fur who serves as Natsu`s best friend and initial partner before Lucy`s inclusion in the Fairy Tail guild.\nhttp://anidb.net/cr7578 [Mashima Hiro] originally planned to name him \"Freyr\" after the Norse god, but found the name did not fit his character.\nHappy possesses a magical ability called Aera (翼), which allows him to temporarily grow white feathered wings on his back and fly. He is only able to carry up to one person at a time in this form.\nHe is generally cheerful as per his name, and often utters the catchphrase \"Aye!\" (あい) or \"Aye, sir!\" (あいさ).\nSource: wikipedia",
