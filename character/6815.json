Contrary to the Kannagi doctrine that is based solely on strength, Juugo has been trying to stop discrimination against the Fuuga Clan. He also regrets not being able to stop Kazuma`s expulsion from the family. Believing that Kazuma is essential to the Kannagis, he constantly creates situations in which Ayano can form a relationship with Kazuma.",
