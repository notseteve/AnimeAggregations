  "description" : "Another high-performance prototype developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-107 Bawoo is the first Zeon-style transformable mobile suit which can separate into more than one component. In the Bawoo`s case, the mobile suit can separate into two separate fighters, called Bawoo Attacker and Bawoo Nutter. The initial prototype features a cockpit in each of the two fighters, but the final production version features a single pilot occupying the Attacker and an unmanned Nutter controlled either via wireless remote control from the pilot in the Attacker, or - if the area`s Minovsky particle density is thick enough to jam transmissions - by an onboard auto-pilot computer control system. The two components can also be quickly re-combined into the mobile suit mode. These features make the Bawoo the first mobile weapon that allows its pilot to effectively control more than one combat unit in the field at the same time. Along with its beam rifle, beam sabers, and grenade launchers, the Bawoo also carries a shield which mounts five, fire-linked mega particle guns, greatly increasing its firepower. Although initially planned as a limited production unit for high-ranking officers and aces (with one custom, orange-colored unit operated by Glemy Toto), the Bawoo`s versatility offered by its transformation systems make it highly popular, and the Bawoo soon finds its way into full mass production.\nSource: mahq.net",
