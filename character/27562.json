  "description" : "Mateo & Marissa`s Grandfather ran a glass and crystal shop on Sunburst Island until he died. When he ran the store, it was full of glass and it was a big success. He was a really talented artist and he made beautiful glass Pok√©mon sculptures every day.\nHe told Mateo all the time that when he was a young artist he saw the Crystal Onix and that`s what inspired him to make great sculptures. After seeing the Crystal Onix, he turned out one great sculpture after another. Whenever he needed some inspiration, all he had to do was think of that Crystal Onix. Mateo & Marissa took over his shop after he died and continued in his footsteps.",
