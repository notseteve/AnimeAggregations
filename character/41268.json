  "description" : "Oz`s uncle. He is easy-going and very caring. Oscar was the one who found Gilbert and brought him to the Vessalius Dukedom. Both Oz and Gilbert treat him as a father figure. He gets along well with Break. When he received a letter from Ada (in which she stated that she had found someone who she likes), he took Oz, Gilbert and Alice to Lutwidge. He was said to be married to a sickly woman and had hopes of bearing a child. It`s assumed she died without the chance to bear a child, as the camera he was going to use to take a picture of his son with was never used.\nSource: Wikipedia",
