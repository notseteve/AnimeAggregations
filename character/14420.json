Yuki is in the Senior rank.\nIn season 2, Yuki became a goddess. She works and watches over the world, especially the animals and Goro. In this season she replaces the previous goddess who broke a part of their rules. As the goddess she became stronger and had a stronger will to take part in the sage`s dream.\nHer white skin represents a snake`s skin. Her name means snow, alluding to the color of her skin and scales. Her color image is blue. In Yuki`s past life she died of being burnt to death; because of this she is afraid of fire.",
