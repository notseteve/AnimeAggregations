  "description" : "Aoki Masaru is Ippo`s senpai and Kimura`s best friend. Aoki provides much of the gym`s comic relief and exercises one of the world`s most unusual fighting styles. A few of his signature techniques include the fan-favorite Frog Punch, double punch, an untorqued (ineffective) corkscrew punch, and the utterly ridiculous Lookaway. In the past, he and Kimura were the toughest high-school thugs around, but now Aoki`s real job is at a ramen restaurant. Due to the numerous times being dumped by the pretty girls in high school, he`s developed a taste for women with unattractive faces. He has fought for the Japanese lightweight championship and shares an apartment with his girlfriend, Tomiko, a friend of Kumi Mashiba whose nice personality and good body more than compensate for her less-than-stellar face. Aoki seems to be based off of hardcore fight fan hero Emanuel Augustus for his offbeat fighting style and record. His current record stands at 10-6-4, with 6 KOs.",
