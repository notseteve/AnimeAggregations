  "description" : "Misdreavus is a moderately-sized, corporeal apparition that somewhat resembles the disembodied head of a human female. It lacks a nose, has thick, flowing \"hair\", and large, yellow eyes with red irises. It appears to wear a necklace of red pearls. Misdreavus lives deep in dark caves. It projects frightening screeching and wailing noises, as well as creepy, sobbing cries, at enemy Pokemon it encounters in the caves, so as to build up a level of fright strong enough so that the Pokemon will flee. Misdreavus` pearl necklace apparently serves as its means for feeding by absorbing the fearful feelings of targets for nutrition.\nIn the event that a human, trepid or otherwise, enters a cave area inhabited by a Misdreavus, the Pokemon will attempt to drive him or her out by biting and pulling at the intruding human`s hair, which is used for defense.",
