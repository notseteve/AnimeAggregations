  "description" : "Manon is a new Trainer just starting her journey in the Kalos region. She refers to her partner Harimaron as \"Hari-san\", who she just got recently from Professor Sycamore and she always asks it for help.\nWhile traveling in the forest she watched the Mega Evolution battle between Ayaka and Alan (Kalos) and was shocked when she saw his black Lizardon. She was fascinated with it and wanted to learn more despite Alan not being very forthcoming with his answers.\nShe was very impressed and amazed with the story that Professor Sycamore told about Ash Ketchum and how Professor Sycamore`s Garchomp at the laboratory went on a rampage.\nHaving watched Alan battle Mega Evolved Pok√©mon, Manon decided that she wanted to search for Mega Stones with Alan (Kalos) and he carelessly agreed to let her travel with him.",
