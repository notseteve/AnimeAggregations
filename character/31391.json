  "description" : "Mishima Kagome is a Colonel in the Ground Self-Defense Force with an IQ of 250. She is assigned to be Mao-chan`s homeroom teacher in order to watch over her for her (Mao`s) grandfather who she is madly in love with. In the manga, she is revealed to be the striking image of Rikushirou`s late wife, Onigawara Kunie. Despite her better judgement, she will do anything for Rikushirou if asked (and might regret the decision later). As she`s pulling double duty with being the United Defense Force`s commanding officer and the girls` homeroom teacher, she tends to be tired out a lot and is often asleep in class.\nBears a striking resemblance to Narusegawa Naru from Love Hina minus one hair antennae. The resemblance is noted upon in ep 20 when they come face to face with Naru, and as an added bonus for the english version, the same voice actress for Naru plays Mishima Kagome as well.\nAfter the climactic battle in the manga, she is seen to be still teaching as Mao-chan`s homeroom teacher three years later.",
