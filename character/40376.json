  "description" : "Tuttle is a water supply servicing man who was coming to check on the Pokémon Center`s water supply near Raimon City when Ash and his friends arrived at the center. Nurse Joy (Isshu) explained that she called the water department after she was experiencing problems with the water earlier that morning.\nTuttle explained that the water supply for this Pokémon Center relies on spring water from a nearby cave where many wild Dangoro live. Iris was quick to point out to him that they had seen a Dangoro earlier in the day. Tuttle decided to go check out the cave and Ash and his friends came along with him.\nAfter dealing with Rocket Gang, Tuttle told Nurse Joy (Isshu) that he informed the water department about the situation at the cave and that they would begin the water supply restoration process immediately as well as fix the habitat for the Dangoro.",
