  "description" : "Hobbies: Colleting information on magic items, expanding magic shops\nEmployee at LAWSON Royal Capital Shop. She`s bright, and one of the rare few people who can talk casually to Raul. For example, they can have a casual chat in the classroom, but she`s not a girl he sees a romantic interest. Although it seems Elza has a thing for Raul on the other hand... She`s an extreme magic item aficionado. She`s what you`d call a consumer electronics otaku. She was born in the rural country where no shops existed, but she read through catalogs until the pages wore out.\nSource: ANN",
