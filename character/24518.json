  "description" : "McCann is an old man who lives in a very windy and mountainous area near Daybreak Town. Ash and his friends first met him when they got lost in the woods and came upon the valley where McCann and his granddaughter were having a battle. He is an expert when it comes to midair Pokémon battles, and that`s why he`s called an Air Battle Master. However, he has retired and rarely battles anymore, apart from having practice battles with his granddaughter Maya from time to time. Even though many Pokémon trainers have asked him to either take them on as apprentices or, if that can`t be done, to at least train their Pokémon to become stronger in air battles, he has turned them all down, because he didn`t see any potential in the trainers` Pokémon.\nHe owns a Scizor which he has trained in order to take advantage of the wind currents when it battles. He used that Scizor against Ash`s Gliscor, when Ash asked the Air Battle Master to have a battle with him so that he could test his Gliscor`s strength. The battle ended in an absolute victory for Scizor due to it skillfully using the wind currents to dodge Gliscor`s attacks. After seeing that Gliscor was unable to land a single hit on Scizor, he advised Ash to practice on how to `read` the wind movements along with his Pokémon, so that it can become stronger.\nHe later accepted another battle challenge from Ash. Using his Scizor again, he battled against a stronger Gliscor, but still managed to win. He was amazed, though, by Gliscor`s overnight improvement, as well as its strong, newly-learned Giga Impact attack, and offered Ash to train his Pokémon. Ash accepted the offer after noticing his Gliscor`s will to become stronger, and thus left it in McCann`s care.",
