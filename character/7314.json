  "description" : "Dokuro is a cute angelic assassin from the future brought back through time to kill Sakura Kusakabe, but instead tries to save him. Mostly, she is just like any other young girl but where other girls might shout or slap to express their displeasure, Dokuro draws her magical spiked kanabou \"Excaliborg\" and brutally clubs her victim to death with it (the gag is the only real victim of the clubbing is Sakura). \"Excalibolg\" is likely a reference to the legendary weapons Excalibur and Caladbolg. She has super-human strength and endurance (because of this she often underestimates her own strength and harms Sakura), and is also capable of bringing someone back to life with Excalibolg by chanting \"Pipiru piru piru pipiru pi\". She also can, and does, use her magic to cause humans to transform into animals, or to apparently completely erase them from existence. When she is not brutally killing Sakura she teases him mercilessly, mostly using sexual innuendo and lifting her skirt or shirt. She is in love with Sakura and hints that they have kissed (though Sakura vehemently denies this). Eventually, she founds a school club dedicated to watching wood glue dry, after gaining a teacher`s approval using some sort of torture involving \"the nerves of your teeth\". She promptly coerces Sakura into becoming its second member (by sticking him onto a board and leaving him there until he joins) and has stated her desire to achieve the national championship in this particular `sport`. As of the second season, Dokuro has become more \"comfortable\" with Sakura seeing her nude, from stripping in front of him and snuggling up to him while both of them were naked.",
