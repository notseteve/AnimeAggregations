  "description" : "A minor update to the GuAIZ introduced in the last stages of the previous war. Its R designation stands for Reinforced. Instead of the extensional arrestors of the original version, the GuAIZ R is armed with a pair of railguns for greater medium-range firepower, and the dual beam claw in its shield has been replaced by a single beam saber. This upgraded machine served as the main mobile suit of the ZAFT forces until the introduction of the ZAKU series.",
