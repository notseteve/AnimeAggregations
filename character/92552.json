  "description" : "Olivia`s Probopass and Olivia`s Lycanroc battled against Ash`s Rockruff and Ash`s Rowlet during the Grand Trial for Ash at the Ruins of Life on Akala Island. As the Compass Pok√©mon, it freely controls three units called Mini-Noses with magnetic force and it played a large role in the battle. The Mini-Noses` formation attack couldn`t be underestimated because the Magnet Bomb could deal heavy damage even if only one of them hit. In a Double Battle, the Mini-Noses` made the match a five against two which put Ash at an overwhelming disadvantage.\nProbopass provided mostly support for Olivia`s Lycanroc which did most of the attacks during the battle. It got knocked out by Ash`s Rowlet using the Grass-type Z-Crystal and attacking with the Z-Move Bloom Doom.",
