  "description" : "This mobile gun platform, Adzam, is the predecessor to Zeon`s series of huge, non-humanoid mobile armors. Its Minovsky craft system enables it to float through the air for brief periods, attacking ground targets with its eight mega particle cannon turrets and the electrical weapon known as the \"Adzam leader.\" In Central Asia, Captain M`quve and Kycilia Zabi co-pilot the Adzam in an attempt to drive the Gundam away from one of their precious mining bases.",
