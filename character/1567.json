  "description" : "Shark is a member of Seto Group initially summoned by Sun`s father during the Michishio family`s initial visit to the Seto family home to attack Nagasumi. In human form, he later becomes Nagasumi`s P.E. teacher. By his thinking, the sooner Nagasumi dies, the sooner everyone can return home. He often acts on this logic, trying to eat him. According to him, the answer to all problems is by eating the person causing the chaos, be it Sun`s or Lunar`s fans or a suicide bomber from his own group.",
