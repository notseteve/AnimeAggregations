  "description" : "Konoha is the number 9 member of the Blindfold group. He is the last group member.\nHis ability is \"Awaken\". This ability makes him shift into the body he finds ideal. He also possesses abnormal physical strength.\nKonoha is a kind and caring boy living with Hyori`s sister as a foster child. He suffers from amnesia, he only knows his name, and has no memory of his past and knows nothing from outside world. He befriends Hyori and Hibiya and later tries to save them from void space.\nHe also is a glutten and has an odd attachment to Hibiya`s cooking.\nKonoha is in fact Haruka. Haruka dies and enters the void space (Heat Haze). Then he acquires Awakening power and changes to a powerful ideal body. This, however, caused him to loose all of his memory. So after escaping from the void, he remains without any memory of himself and his past.\nKonoha is in fact one of Haruka`s favorite illustrations of a powerful game character.\nHis songs are: \"Konoha no Sekai Jijou\" (Konoha`s World Affairs) which is a retell of a \"Kageru Daze\" story which he is the witness of Hyori and Hibiya`s countless deaths, yet is unable to save them, and \"Outer Science\" which tells a story about the trauma of \"awakening\" his eyes which leads him to change his form.",
