  "description" : "Munsu is an Angyo Onshi, a street-judge who aims to uphold justice, help the weak, and bring justice to corrupt local government officials. Munsu is initially portrayed as an anti-hero, with methods that can be questionable and often misinterpreted as \"evil.\" Although his physical condition seems to be good, Munsu suffers from a strange illness that resembles asthma. This illness can only be alleviated by inhaling through an inhaler-like charm he wears around his neck.",
