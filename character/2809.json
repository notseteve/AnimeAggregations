  "description" : "A mysterious girl who claims to be a volunteer from a \"charity project\" to help hikikomori like Tatsuhiro. She has the tendency to lie and hides facts such as the fact that she dropped out of high school, but she does not mean any harm. She tells Tatsuhiro whatever it takes to make him pay attention to her. She seems to have a deep attachment to Tatsuhiro, and often shows symptoms suggesting she has a borderline personality disorder. She makes a contract with Tatsuhiro in order to believe that she is needed by somebody and therefore not an unwanted person who only makes others around her unhappy. Her biological father died when she was very young and her mother died by falling off the cape in her hometown. It is never revealed if the cause of death was suicide or if the wind had knocked her off. After her mother`s death, she was forced to live with her abusive stepfather who constantly beat her. [Spoiler]Due to this experience, when Tatsuhiro is about to hit her following the events at the island, she flinches by instinct. She loves Sato and tries to make it seem like he needs her more but in reality she is even more lonely than him to the point where she attempts to commit suicide after Sato refuses her feelings in a second contract she makes. She is seen at the end of the anime getting help from Sato to finish her high school degree, so that she and Sato can go and finish college in order to start their life (relationship) officially together.[/Spoiler] Misaki`s personality greatly differs between the manga and the anime, in the manga she appears more sarcastic and doesn`t hesitate to reprimand Tatsuhiro while in the anime, she has an introverted personality.\n(Wikipedia)",
