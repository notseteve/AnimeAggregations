  "description" : "Athena Glory is one of Neo-Venezia`s Three Water Fairies, known by the title \"Siren\" (天上の謳声[セイレーン], Tenjou no Utagoe, lit. \"Heavenly Voice\") for her beautiful singing voice. Her blade oar number is 36. She is http://anidb.net/ch8499 [Alice]`s mentor at http://anidb.net/ch125950 [Orange Planet]. She often appears quiet most of the time and an airhead who does not pay attention to her surroundings (in the anime, she is shown more than once forgetting to duck while rowing under a bridge), but she genuinely cares about Alice.\nAthena has a strange laugh that comes out sounding as though she is angry. She was a trainee undine with http://anidb.net/ch1287 [Alicia] and http://anidb.net/ch8505 [Akira], and joined them in joint practice.\nHer signature song is http://anidb.net/s7270 [Barcarolle], sung by the vocalist http://anidb.net/cr3917 [Kawai Eri]. Throughout the series, Athena also features two other songs with vocals by Kawai Eri: http://anidb.net/s7258 [Coccoro] and http://anidb.net/s52857 [Lumis Eterne].",
