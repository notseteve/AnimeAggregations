  "description" : "The Index Librorum Prohibitorum (\"List of Prohibited Books\") was a list of publications prohibited by the Roman Catholic Church and the name of a secret organisation under the Vatican to monitor and if necessary stop the publication and distribution of works that were deemed as heretical and dangerous to the Church. Its members are adept in combat techniques and posses magical powers.\nAlthough officially abolished on 14 June 1966 by Pope Paul VI, the Index is still being kept, although its activities are being kept to a minimum because of possible political implications.\n----\nPicture: Title page of Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Venice 1564).",
