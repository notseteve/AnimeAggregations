  "description" : "A beautiful male angel with long dark hair and wings. In Eden, where angels are generally fair-haired with white wings, Chihaya`s naturally dark features make him a sort of an outcast. Despite his mutation, he is light-hearted and happy, and he cares deeply for the Earthian, unlike most other angels. This rare quality allows him to see beyond the Earthians` violence and destruction to the core of their hearts, which he believes are pure and kind, despite any other shortcomings. He is a plus checker, though he tends to let his emotions get in the way of his work. His special power is the ability to generate storms.",
