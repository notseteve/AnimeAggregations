  "description" : "One of the four members of the \"Four Sacred Beast Houses\", he is capable of summoning a large black panther called Kaede. He tends to have a laid back personality, but can be serious when he wants to. He also seems to be privy to Rio`s secrets and tends to act in the shadows (not to mention takes his time on missions). His panther doesn`t like the main House too much, saying it`s much too crowded with all the other Beasts there.",
