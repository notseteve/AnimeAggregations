  "description" : "Brycen`s Beartic is Brycen main companion Pokémon. It is quite a famous Pokémon as it was featured in the movies \"Freeze, Tunbear\", \"The Path to the Ice\" and \"Iron Fist of Ice\", which were all huge hits and the cause of long waiting lines at the theaters.\nBrycen was training with his Beartic when it rescued Ash and his friends from being crushed by a rock trap that Rinzo set. Later, when confronting Rinzo`s Jellicent ♂ and Rinzo`s Jellicent ♀, it showed how strong it was by taking them both out while aiming so that Rinzo went into his cage with them where he would wait to be arrested.\nGym Battle against Ash`s Krokorok\nAfter Ash had knocked out Brycen`s Vanillish and Brycen`s Vanillish, Brycen`s Beartic managed to knock out Ash`s Pignite which left him with just his Ash`s Krokorok who had already battled against Brycen`s Vanillish. Seeing Brycen`s Beartic made Ash`s Krokorok want to become stronger itself and Ash`s Krokorok was were waiting for this battle. It had a type advantage in the battle and together with Ash, they battled with all their strength. Brycen`s Beartic used Icicle Crash as a defense against Stone Edge. Ash was able to counter that though by remembering Bianca`s Emboar method that she used at the Donamite and Ash`s Krokorok picked up a stray rock and jumped into the air to meet Brycen`s Beartic for one final attack. The two of them collided in the air but Ash`s Krokorok was the one that ended up victorious by defeating Brycen`s Beartic.",
