  "description" : "Kataoka Yuuki is a high school freshman who attends the same school as Saki and is a member of the Mahjong Club. She, like the other members of the Mahjong Club, is highly skilled. However, she cannot stay focused and makes more mistakes as the game progresses. She is often seen eating tacos, which seem to increase her skill when playing mahjong. Additionally, food with names similar to taco, like the Japanese hot dogs sliced like an octopus can increase her skill partially as well.",
