  "description" : "Kazuma is a former member of the Kannagi household. He was banished from the family by his father after he was defeated by Ayano during the Successor Ceremony for the Enraiha, his family`s sacred sword. Since Kazuma is a son from the main family, making him the legitimate successor, even his own father considered him a disgrace for lacking the power to use fire magic, his family`s specialty. Four years later, at the age of twenty-two, he returns to Japan as a skilled master of the wind arts. Though he was not responsible for the killings in the Kannagi household, he is prepared to start a war with his former family.",
