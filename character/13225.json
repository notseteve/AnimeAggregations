He is a doctor at the private \"Itoshiki Clinic.\" When his name is written horizontally it resembles zetsumei (death), which explains why his hospital is rarely visited by the town`s residents; he has a tendency to lose control of himself whenever he is referred to as \"Zetsumei-sensei\" (Dr. Death).",
