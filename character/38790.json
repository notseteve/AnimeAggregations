  "description" : "Aizawa Kakeru`s older brother and was revered as the savior of Japanese football before his tragic death in a fatal car accident. Because he became brain dead, Suguru`s heart was transplanted to Kakeru so he could live. In the process, Suguru`s unfulfilled dream of winning the world cup was passed along with his heart. It was Suguru`s \"last pass\" to Kakeru.\nAppearance:\nCompared to Kakeru, Suguru`s features are much sharper and developed. He has dark gray eyes and spikey hair that points outward in all direction. Even though he is only one year older than Kakeru, Suguru appears to be significantly taller.\nPersonality:\nSuguru is often portrayed as a strict and calm leader in soccer matches. His teammates often look to him for guidance in developing strategies. According to Kakeru, It seems like he is never fazed by anything. However, deep down, Suguru is deeply bothered by all the pressure and the future for Japan`s football, so much that he often would have nightmares because of it.\nAs a brother, Suguru is very caring but, nonetheless, tough on Kakeru. Because of his high expectation of Kakeru, Suguru will not go easy on Kakeru no matter what. But behind Suguru`s tough exterior, you can see his genuine hope for Kakeru to become a great football player.\nSource: areanokishi.wikia",
