  "description" : "Miu is a cheerful, clumsy and often clueless student in Ayane`s class at Tategami High. She has few wants or desires apart from spending time with her friends, going on dates, and managing the school`s soccer team. Miu`s Gate power manifests itself when she attempts to escape from the excessive attentions of one of her dates -- and that is when Ayane discovers her as well, and reluctantly recruits her to the AEGIS cause.\nAfter being recruited by Ayane, Miu starts to hang out with her which makes her friends wonder what made her hang out with such a weird person. When Miu is in Ayane`s presence, she asks if she can do anything, but Ayane either ignores her or just tells her how worthless she is. Miu, upon being asked by Ayane what she is fighting for, answers that she wants to make everyone happy and is just curious. Her close friends, Chinami and Nao, even says that she does not get mad at all.",
