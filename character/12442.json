  "description" : "A girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her, she has had a huge crush on Kazehaya since their first year of middle school. She dislikes her given name, Ume, because it sounds old-fashioned and prefers to be called her nickname, \"Kurumi.\" She is extremely jealous of Sawako, which led her to spread fake rumours of Sawako`s only friends at the time, Yoshida and Yano, using Sawako`s name. Kurumi does not attend the same class as Sawako or Kazehaya.\nShe eventually confesses her love to Kazehaya, but receives an expected rejection. Because she is always surprised with Sawako`s naivet√©, Kurumi is able to become friends with her, as well as a rival for Kazehaya`s affection. Following Kazehaya`s rejection, she becomes colder to her classmates, but is able to finally express her true feelings and personality.",
