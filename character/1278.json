  "description" : "Manaphy, known as the Seafaring Pokémon, made its debut is in the 9th Pokémon anime film, Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, and is thought to be the \"Prince of the Sea\" Pokémon alluded to in the title of the Japanese movie. It was the sixth Pokémon of the fourth generation to be revealed by CoroCoro magazine. It was revealed alongside the silhouettes of three other Pokémon: Mantyke, Buizel, and Chatot.\nMany years ago, a Phione accidentally laid a mysterious, bright blue egg with a red heart inside it. It eventually hatched into a smaller Phione, which was named Manaphy. Many Phione began to worship it and Manaphy became the \"Prince of the Sea\". When bred with Ditto, Manaphy is able to produce more Phione.\nManaphy are blue blob-like Pokémon. They have two long antennae extending from atop their head. At the end of these antennae are round objects that resemble a ball. Manaphy can use their antennae to use Heart Swap and switch people`s energy. They also have jewel-like markings on their stomachs, one large red gem and a very small yellow gem. They are said to live in cold waters, and migrate miles away from their homes only to return. Manaphy can mimic human language as the Manaphy in Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea was able to say certain words and sentences.\nManaphy is only obtainable through a Nintendo Event, or by completing Pokémon Ranger and defeating the special Manaphy mission, which will only become available after the player inputs a password. This password has been revealed by Nintendo on numerous occasions.",
