  "description" : "This version of the Geara Zulu, the Sleeves` main mobile suit, is used by Full Frontal`s elite guards. Its thrust is dramatically enhanced so that it can operate alongside the Sinanju, and its shoulders are equipped with large spike armor that gives it a more aggressive silhouette. The chest and wrist markings, from which the Sleeves get their nickname, are more elaborate than those of an ordinary machine to show that it belongs to the royal guards.",
