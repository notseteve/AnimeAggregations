  "description" : "Punie`s little sisters who sneak to Japan in order to assassinate her. They possess the \"Ring of Immortal\", a magical heirloom which they use in order to summon a spirit to destroy Punie. They activate this artefact with the incantation \"Lyrical Tokarev, Destroy All Evil\". Whether or not this is their own personal incantation or the activation incantation for the Ring of Immortal is left to conjecture. When executing combination attacks, they preface their attack names with \"Gemini\" such as the \"Gemini Knee Drop\" and the \"Gemini Low Kick\".",
