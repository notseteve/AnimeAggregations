  "description" : "A small front line warship, the Oberth Class was built to be the primary combat warship of the new United Nations Spacy fleet. Built with OverTechnology and armed with reaction weaponry, the Oberth`s made up for their small size with significant firepower. With the first Oberth originally commissioned in March 2005, plans quickly expanded to build many more of this class (despite the setback of the third destroyer, the Tsiolkovsky, being hijacked and subsequently destroyed in September 2005). Eventually, over 125 of these vessels were built and participated in combat against the Zentradi http://anidb.net/ch17601 [Boddole Zer] Main Fleet in February 2010.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/oberth.htm",
