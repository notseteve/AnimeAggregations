  "description" : "The only daughter of the rich Sagamiono family, Chie entered the Metropolitan Police Department Academy in hopes of winning a suitable, preferably rich, husband and making herself a bit more popular to society, earning questions from some of the officers as to why a rich girl would join the police force. She had lost her chance to graduate on top of her class when Yoriko earned it via luck, marking her as Chie`s rival. She uses her family`s financial position to use a modified Porsche 911 outfitted with sirens and a radio for police use.\nThe two had been at odds with each others from catching crooks in a contest, to playing wargames to a Color Guard parade contest.",
