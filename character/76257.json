  "description" : "While training in a forest near Hyakkoku City, Ash`s Hawlucha found an egg which he brought to Ash Ketchum. He decided to go back to where it was found to see if there was a nest but by the time he got there, the egg started to hatch. Ash`s Fletchinder was instrumental in helping the egg hatch as it has an Ability called \"Flame Body\" that makes eggs hatch faster. Ash Ketchum and his friends didn`t know what kind of Pok√©mon egg it was until Noibat hatched.\nNoibat cries by using the move Supersonic which is quite deafening and it won`t stop until Ash Ketchum pets it as it thinks he`s its parent. Its favorite food is fruit and it can tell the ripeness of a fruit.\nAsh`s Hawlucha and Ash`s Fletchinder helped it learn to fly by teaching it first how to glide on the wind. After an encounter with Rocket Gang in which Ash`s Hawlucha protected Noibat it returned to Ash Ketchum and he asked Noibat if it wanted to travel with him and it agreed.",
