  "description" : "Juppongatana is an elite group of swordsmen (mostly) that acts as a special attack force. They fight under Shishio Makoto against the Meiji government. Watsuki said that several of his assistants suggested ideas for the Ten Swords and that many of the characters grew out of those ideas. In Watsuki`s original concept, with the exception of Soujirou none of the Ten Swords were intended to be \"lookers.\" Watsuki added Kamatari and Fuji at a later point. When Watsuki believed that one member of the Ten Swords, Saizuchi, had not been used to his full potential, in retrospect Watsuki wondered if having six or seven members of the organization would have been sufficient instead of ten.",
