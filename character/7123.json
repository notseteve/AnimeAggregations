  "description" : "Lenalee Lee is a 16-year-old Exorcist from Hong Kong and member of the http://anidb.net/ch32499 [European Branch] of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order]. Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young, and she was forced to become an Exorcist as a child.\nBecause she was separated from her brother http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Komui], her only remaining family member, she repeatedly tried to escape and was restrained. This caused her to hate the Order and Innocence. When Komui joined the Order to be with her, she stopped trying to escape. She now fights for her brother as well as her friends, as she now knows she has a home and family to return to. Her perception of the \"world\" consists of her friends and family; whenever one of her friends dies, it seems to her as if a part of her world has been destroyed.\nThe Dark Boots, her Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, take the form of a pair of black, knee-high boots that give her the ability to run at high speeds, jump to great heights, walk on water, create whirlwinds and use sound waves as footholds.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
