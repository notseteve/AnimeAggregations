  "description" : "Arisugawa Sorata is an upbeat teenager possessing considerable occult abilities, raised by the Shingon Buddhist monks of Kouyasan after being taken away from his mother at a young age. A gourmand, he was frequently in trouble at the shrine for stealing food between meals (insisting that he couldn`t wait until dinner), and is also a competent cook. It was prophesied that he would protect Kamui with his life, but that he would die for a woman; the first time he meets Arashi, he decides she will be the one. An incessantly friendly young man, he wears down the resistance of both Kamui and Arashi and worms his way into their affections, despite their initial coldness and his own unrefined Kansai dialect. He is surprisingly perceptive, being able to read both Kamui and Arashi`s thoughts from their facial expressions, and with Kamui, is able to discern that other forces besides the Dragons of Earth may be working against them.\nIn Tsubasa Chronicle, he appears several times as a prominent crossover character. In the first instance he appears as a history teacher married to Arashi, and acts as host to Syaoran and his companions in the Hanshin Republic as a repayment to a debt he owed to Yuko the Dimension Witch. He also appears as a Dragonfly Racer in the Piffle World, and also as one of the seven fighters in the Tower Faction in Tokyo Revelations.",
