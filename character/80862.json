After being bested by Sakamoto, Atsushi no longer smokes, instead choosing to blow bubbles. He harbors both resentment and admiration to Sakamoto.\nDuring the third year students` graduation ceremony, he was manipulated into attacking Sakamoto while he delivered a speech. Eventually, he gave up and voiced his jealousy towards Sakamoto and the latter covered up his attack as a part of his speech, saving him from disciplinary punishments.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
