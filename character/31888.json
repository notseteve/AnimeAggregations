  "description" : "Tennyo Masaki (柾木 天女 ) is Tenchi Masaki`s older sister, making her first appearance in the third OVA series.\nTennyo is an exact double for Kiyone Masaki, Tenchi`s and her mother in the OVAs. Despite her youthful looks, Tennyo is 80 years old, and like her grandfather Katsuhito (Yosho), she often uses an older appearance when among others. Because of her similarity to Kiyone Masaki, Tennyo would often swap places with her and take care of Tenchi when he was a baby. She left right after Tenchi`s mother had died, only to reappear when it came time to introduce Noike.\nSource: Wikipedia",
