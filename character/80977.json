  "description" : "Robon is a robot that Professor Ichigaya made to help him with his research and scientific work. The last thing Professor Ichigaya did was finish creating Robon before he died.\nProfessor Ichigaya researched environments in which Pokémon and people can live in happiness. The area he was working in was once a beautiful forest blessed with abundant nature and many wild Pokémon lived there. Just before he was about to look for the cause of the problem, he was struck with an incurable illness. He somehow managed to complete the development of Robon, a robot that can renaturate the forest. Robon and Brigarron were his last hope and he asked that if they were ever in trouble, he hoped someone to help them out.\nWhen Rocket Gang severely damaged Robon, Professor Ichigaya`s Chesnaught got extremely angry and broke through the reinforced rings to send them flying off. Clemont though was able to fix it at the lab and it was reactivated. It was then able to use its Rock removal circuit to destroy the rock and allow the water vein to make the area fertile again. It continues to work in the area now by planting seeds and watering the seedlings.",
