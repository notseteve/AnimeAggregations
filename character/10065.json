  "description" : "Junko`s boyfriend who currently shares an apartment with her. He is also good friends with Hachi and Shoji. His laid-back attitude to life may deem him a slacker in the eyes of many, but he is actually quite perceptive and he coddles Hachi more than Junko would like. Both he and Junko are studying to become artists (his art being Romantic and hers being Post-Modernistic). Although Shoji has said several times that he used to be a player, Kyosuke says very seriously that he would never cheat on Junko because he is afraid of losing her. He also says that he liked Junko the moment he saw her.\nDescription taken from Wikipedia",
