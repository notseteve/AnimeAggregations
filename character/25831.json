  "description" : "IGO`s Development Bureau Director and Gourmet Research Facility Chief, he holds IGO`s third position, with authority below the CEO and President. He is an old friend of Toriko`s and has the same body type. He runs IGO`s Garden One, a facility where 30% of the world`s gourmet foods are made. It also clones long extinct animals and performs selective breeding. He has an incredibly high pain tolerance, able to live through being stabbed in the gut and a hole blown through his throat, and he heals himself by drinking alcohol. He appears to be able to use the same muscle enhancing abilities that Jirou the Knocking master uses. When someone says his name he thinks they are calling him handsome; this is a pun as his name sounds similar to the English word \"handsome.\" He seems to be always drunk or just in a really happy state most of the time, only when someone mentions a job that needs doing or when he is gets angry does he change to a more serious manner.",
