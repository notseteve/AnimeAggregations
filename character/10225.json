  "description" : "Hanamoto Shuuji is a professor at the college that Morita, Mayama, Takemoto, Yamada, and Hagu attend, serving as the father figure for the group. He is also Hagu`s relative (he is father`s cousin) and the person that Hagu is really closest to, and gets very overprotective of her at times. Shuuji is a close friend of Rika and her late husband, who had been his roommate until Rika and her husband married. Unlike his friends, Shuuji`s artistic talent was not remarkably impressive, but found he was good at explaining things like art history and anatomy (subjects which Harada and Rika shruggled with) and eventually decided to become a teacher as a result.\nWhen Rika`s husband died in a traffic accident, he took care of Rika so that she wouldn`t try and join her husband in death, but Shuuji begins to wonder if Rika would`ve been happier if she died alongside her husband. Because of this, Shuuji recommends Mayama as Rika`s new assistant; he believed Mayama`s companionship would be a healthy change for Rika.",
