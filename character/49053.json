  "description" : "The Golg Gants Charts heavy attack vehicle is the smallest craft that can be mounted with a warship gun and is designed to be a fast and maneuverable anti-ship unit. Built around the central converging energy beam cannon, the pilot controls both the craft and the main gun from inside the cockpit on the port side of the vessel while a gunner is situated inside the anti-aircraft turret on the starboard side. Possessing a double barrel laser cannon turret and two missile launchers for defense, the Golg Gants Charts must still rely on friendly supporting units to defend against light or medium enemy mecha. Often these ships are utilized in unison with other heavy attack craft and friendly mecha to engage enemy forces with some measure of success. During Space War I the Golg Gants Charts saw only limited use by the Zentradi forces as it was vulnerable to the strong destroid defenses of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. However, the Golg Gants Charts was still feared for it`s great firepower and maneuverability superior to that of any large warship. In one notable battle during Space War I, the Golg Gants Charts attacked the forward destroid forces on the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] directly, allowing supporting heavy attack craft a chance to penetrate the hull of the U.N. Spacy ship and lead the http://anidb.net/ch49049 [Nousjadeul-Ger] battle suit forces inside.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/golg-gants-charts.htm",
