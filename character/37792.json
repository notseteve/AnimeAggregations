  "description" : "Ponzu (ポンズ) is one of the 24 candidates that managed to enter the fourth stage of the Hunter Exam. She fights using chemical weapons, a wide variety of toxins, and prefers to set traps instead of fighting head on. Her secret weapon lies within her round cap, carrying neurotoxic bees under the surface that emerge and attack her enemies when she is threatened. [spoiler=\"Spoiler\"]During this stage, her bees instinctively end up killing Bourbon after she falls into his trap. Ponzu is rescued by Gon, but her badge is taken when she is unconscious so Leorio can pass, causing her to fail the exam. She also attends the following Hunter Exam, where she, along with everyone else, is defeated by Killua. Ponzu is then seen in N.G.L. with Pokkle and several others before their group is attacked by Chimera Ants. The group is killed by Zazan`s squad, but she is able to escape long enough to send one of her bees with a message to the strongest Hunter nearby, who happens to be Kite. She is shot and eaten moments later by a Chimera Ant.[/spoiler]\nSource: Wikipedia",
