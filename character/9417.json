  "description" : "Chief physician leading the Proxy Research Team, Director of the Division of Health and Welfare, and Re-l Mayer`s personal physician.\nDaedalus displays a strange obsession for Re-l Mayer. He has two Entourages, Deleuze and Guattari. In the final episodes, Daedalus has been revealed to have created a fake Re-l (named \"Real\" Mayer) from Monad Proxy`s Amrita Cells as a replacement for the original Re-l and eventually gives her wings. Now mentally unstable, he no longer cares what happens to the world. The fake Re-l is taken over by Monad Proxy and leaves. Daedalus, concluding that Re-l has always left him behind, is crushed to death by falling rubble. He survives long enough to witness his clone Re-l be incinerated by sunlight.\nSource: Wiki",
