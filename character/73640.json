  "description" : "Ruth is Della`s older sister. She`s a wealthy lady with a big house including staff.\nAfter becoming depressed, Della became really worried about her and asked Polly to \"borrow\" Pollyanna to live with her in Boston - where Pollyanna also gets her treatment -, to help her sister become happy again.\nFor six years Ruth has been shutting herself into her own home, with the curtains closed and no contact to the outside world. She once had a husband, and even a child - both are dead. The event that made her as depressed and unhappy as she is when Pollyanna meets her wasn`t the death of her own family though, it was the death of her sister and the disappearance of her dear nephew Jamie due to his father Edward. Since then she has tried finding him through other people, yet without any success. Pollyanna gets involved and tries to find the boy whatever it takes.",
