  "description" : "Yajima is a first year female student who also decided to join Genshiken after seeing Ogiue`s manga poster drawing demonstration. She too is a fujoshi, though not as blatant about it as Yoshitake. She is of stocky build and tends to wear men`s clothing. She has a very hard time accepting Hato`s cross-dressing even though she knows the whole story behind it and routinely tells him to stop it. Yajima is also one of Ogiue`s paid assistants on Ogiue`s professional manga, doing the erasing of pencil lines and general page cleanup.\nSource: Wiki",
