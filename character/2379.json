  "description" : "Train Heartnet also known as \"Black Cat\", is a sweeper partnered with Sven. Train is a lighthearted, courageous man who`s highly skilled with a gun. He seems to enjoy tormenting Sven and tightening their already small budget as low-paid sweepers by his exaggerated food consumption. Some of Train`s distinguishing features are his spiky brown ruffled hair, his catlike slitted eyes, a choker with a tiny bell attached to it, and the XIII tattoo he has on his chest.",
