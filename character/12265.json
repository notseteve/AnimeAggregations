  "description" : "Kuon is the little creature that takes care of Akari. He looks like a spectre with two luminous eyes but no defined body shape, except by his clothing. He is capable of levitation and apparently has some sharp tentacles, as he is seen carrying a watermelon with them which he later uses to remove the rind from the watermelon.\nTowards the end of the series, Kuon and Ionios turn to mud and become a crystal. Kuon becomes a chip of the crystal which is probably why Kuon was small and Ionios was big.",
