  "description" : "Shuda is the first member of Demon Card`s Oracion Six to be introduced. He fought and lost to Haru Glory twice in the beginning of the series, and after his second defeat, he reforms and becomes an ally of Haru and his friends. He holds the utmost respect for Gale Glory. He uses the high six star Dark Bring Ballett√§nzer Zeffrea, which allows him to cause an explosion within a spherical targeting grid that manifests over a chosen point in space. He also wields two swords: the ghost sword Entenka (which spews forth flames by cutting the wind), and the divine sword Heavenly Blossom, which is claimed to be a weapon of the gods. He is skilled in dancing and taught Elie how to dance for the dance festival in volume 22 and 23. Shuda also is revealed to have a relationship with Haru`s sister.",
