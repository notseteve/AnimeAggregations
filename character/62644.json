  "description" : "Norse God of Fire. He is very attached to Balder and Thor. Due to him being very mischievous, people avoided him in Asgard when he was younger. He calls Yui \"kitty-cat\" and truly hates her when he sees her spending time with Balder, but later softens up to her when he sees that she really wants to be his friend. He is a born prankster, is good at making weapons, and has a pocket full of candy and pranks. Lazy with most things but to things he finds interesting he goes all out. He is a person with unprecedented, unpredictable behavior. He makes mistakes with an unforgiving smile, innocent mass of evil. Genius in making problems anywhere, even in a School. Very nosy and curious about other people`s affairs. His mood is not easy to read. Balder was the only one who befriended Loki despite all his troubles, hence Loki sees Balder as a precious friend, who should only have eyes on him. Some mentioned memories include watching the aurora together with Thor, as well as walking along in the snow, since Asgard is said to be a very cold place.",
