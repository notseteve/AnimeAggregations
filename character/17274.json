  "description" : "Katsuyu is the slug queen summoned by http://anidb.net/ch8606 [Tsunade]. The name Katsuyu apparently comes from Slug (蛞蝓) in on`yomi. Compared to http://anidb.net/ch12000 [Gamabunta] and Manda, the summons of http://anidb.net/ch7213 [Jiraiya] and http://anidb.net/ch8603 [Orochimaru] respectively, Katsuyu is quiet and more subservient to her master. She addresses Tsunade with the highly respectful honorific \"-sama\", and, in the English versions, calls her Mistress or Milady. Katsuyu tends to also use honorifics like \"-kun\" and \"-san\" on other villagers. http://anidb.net/ch7698 [Sakura] and http://anidb.net/ch8613 [Shizune] show her considerable respect, addressing her as \"Katsuyu-sama\". In the English dub, she is referred to as \"Lady Katsuyu\".",
