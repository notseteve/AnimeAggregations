  "description" : "The GOUF Ignited, whose name stands for Guardian Of Unity Forerunner, was developed by ZAFT as a candidate for its next-generation mass production mobile suit. Although the ZAKU series was selected instead, the development of the GOUF continued due to its high performance, and a handful of prototype machines have been assigned to ace pilots such as Heine Westenfluss. The GOUF carries an arsenal of powerful close combat weapons, including a double-edged beam sword and retractable whips that inflict damage via high-frequency vibration, and the flight unit attached to its back gives it superb mobility and the ability to fly in Earth`s atmosphere.\nThe mass production model is coloured blue, some ace pilots have their suits in different colour schemes.",
