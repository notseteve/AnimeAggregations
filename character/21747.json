  "description" : "Claude \"Torch\" Weaver is a heavyset, middle-aged man with blonde hair and glasses and always sports a grin with a look of a stereotypical everyman. He is a pyromaniac who uses a lighter shaped-and-sized flamethrower as his weapon of choice, although for heavy-duty jobs, he will also use a full-sized flamethrower. In spite of his profession and the fact he burnt his own wife to death (which he claims took five minutes), Claude claims to be religious (which religion is unknown) and is teetotal. He is one of the few characters in the series that does not use foul language, preferring to speak with euphemisms (such as \"darn\" or \"shucks\") instead. He is blown up by Revy while hunting for Greenback Jane.",
