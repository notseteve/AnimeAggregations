  "description" : "Misaka 19090 is one of http://anidb.net/ch2469 [Misaka Mikoto]`s http://anidb.net/ch14538 [clones]. Her personality is alike that of the other clones, with suppressed emotions, since they weren`t beneficial to the Level Six experiment. Also similarly to most of the other clones, she seems to have feelings for http://anidb.net/ch2342 [Kamijou Touma], shown when she displays envy towards the other clones. She was the first one to implement a plan to attract him over the other clones.\nIn http://anidb.net/a9484 [Toaru Kagaku no Railgun S], she is shown to have emotions more similar to those of regular people, thanks to the efforts of http://anidb.net/ch55166 [Nunotaba Shinobu].",
