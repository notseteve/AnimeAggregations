  "description" : "Oscha is one of the four Lords of Gaudium. The most mysterious of the four, he serves as Tyrant`s primary advisor. Oscha appears as living shadow of a figure with no legs and arms, though arms do protrude from his near-formless body from time to time. He wears a white mask over his face, and his mad eye can usually be seen when the camera pans up close to him. It is apparently revealed that Oscha is in truth a part of Chaos like the Earl, and does the job of ensuring that Chaos is fed constantly with dark emotions. Oscha is able to bring things to life; such as seen with his work on Crux, the puppet used to spy on the protagonists, and also revive dead people; such as seen with Madoushi.\nFrom the very beginning, Oscha knew of Ai and Yu`s true nature, creating Crux and altering the clock on Chobi`s neck to pinpoint the twins` exact locations while having them experience the various horrors and tragic event across the series, maturing them so when they can be fused with the Earl, Chaos would reach its zenith and evolve. But the plan failed and Oscha falls down into Chaos as his mask is cracked, but he survived. In FFU:After, Oscha helped to revive the Gaudium and search for new Deathlords, leaving Soljashy to make Chaos Rulers, the Earl`s successor, out of the Hayakawa Twins.",
