  "description" : "Ueki`s adoptive father. He is a writer and likes anything weird or unusual. Rather than being shocked or scared at peculiar things, he shouts in excitement, especially when he saw Tenko for the first time ever. He went nuts, as Ueki had predicted, over Tenko, squeezing and stretching his face. He also enjoys sports very much. Extremely energetic. He often says, Reality is Stranger than Fiction!",
