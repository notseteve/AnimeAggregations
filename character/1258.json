  "description" : "Leafeon is covered with tattered leaves, along with moss-green fur. Besides leaf-like ears and tail, there are a multitude of smaller leaves growing from the knee joint, chest, and back. A larger, curled leaf grows from the middle of its forehead, and is the same soft green color as all of the other leaves. Leafeon has plant-like characteristics alongside its animal nature; as such, it is photosynthetic, and, as a result, it is always surrounded by clean air.",
