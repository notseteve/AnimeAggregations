  "description" : "Nano-Nano Pudding is the third member of the Rune Angel Troupe. She is significantly different from the other members as she has light blue hair, as well as a long white tail, and rather narrow pupils. At first glance, she appears to be a catgirl, which isn`t entirely false, given her playful, kitten-like personality. Like her name suggests, she is in fact a living piece of lost technology and a Nano-machine generator, giving her the ability to interact with them in much the same way as Vanilla H, who she refers to as \"Mama\" because it was Vanilla who first discovered her on the Planet Pico. She also has the ability to heal like Vanilla, and it seems that her white tail has the strongest source of nano-machines. During her chapter in the game, she also displays the ability to copy another`s appearance at will (though she highly resents it). She tends to end her sentences with \"nano da\". She looks up to Anise as a `Master` or `Big Sister` seeing how Anise saved Nano-Nano from falling while stealing the Brave Sword.\nHer personal color is sky blue. In battle, she pilots the new Emblem Frame \"First Aider\", which is also the only Emblem Frame to have TWO special attacks, which can be switched at any time. Repair Wave, a healing special similar to the Harvester`s (Vanilla`s Frame) \"Repair Wave\", and an offensive special, Needle Flechette.",
