  "description" : "Professor Amaranth is the leader of Project Mew. He was first seen lifting a bunch of heavy boxes with paper documents in them at the project ship entrance to his office and he got Ash Ketchum and Goh to help him lift them.\nHe informed Goh that the details of Mew are confidential and that a recruitment trial mission must be passed to join Project Mew. During the trial mission, Professor Amaranth tests recruits for their knowledge as a Pok√©mon trainer, their overall ability to get things and instructions as well as their battle skills. He also tests them on their ability to work with other trainers. He indicated that whoever collects the most tokens by the end of the trial period will pass his trial test and only five people would become official Chasers in the search for Mew.\nThe Professor assigned Goh his first trial mission to catch an Alolan Ninetales in the glacial area north of Mt. Coronet. He was successful in completing that mission.",
