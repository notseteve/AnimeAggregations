  "description" : "Karate Master is the head of the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City. He battled against Bea when she visited the dojo as she was traveling the world, visiting every dojo and challenging them and building up both her Pok√©mon and herself, seeking to reach perfection. Her battle with him was to perfection as he was barely able to land a single attack and she didn`t give him a single opening. After his match with her, he allowed her to use the dojo to battle Ash Ketchum and sat on the sidelines and gave his commentary on the battle. His dub voice actor, Kyle Hebert, is cast as a reference to Kyle playing Ryu in the Street Fighter series.",
