  "description" : "Dozer`s Gurdurr battled against Ash`s Farfetch`d in a Great Class World Coronation Series match at the Rock Tunnel entrance in the Kanto region. Gurdurr worked hard to build up its frame into tip-top shape, which made it as trained-up as it could get. Despite its training, it lost the battle to Ash Ketchum after Ash`s Farfetch`d broke through its girder.",
