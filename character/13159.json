  "description" : "Aoi Nami is http://anidb.net/ch13157 [Sora]`s younger twin sister who looks identical to him. Due to their same appearances, Nami ties her hair in pigtails, but her hair is slightly longer than Sora`s when let down. When they were children, she`d often pretend to be Sora. Even through they look alike, their personality are polar opposites. Unlike the quiet and well demeanoured Sora, Nami is a tomboy who has a strong and stubborn attitude. She often forces Sora to cosplay for her own amusement. Like Sora, Nami has a low tolerance to alcohol. She`s secretly in love with http://anidb.net/ch13160 [Kana]. In spite of this, she`s actively trying to get Kana and Sora together.",
