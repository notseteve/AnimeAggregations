  "description" : "Matou Byakuya is the elder brother of http://anidb.net/ch25943 [Matou Kariya] and the father of http://anidb.net/ch1914 [Matou Shinji].\nAlthough he is http://anidb.net/ch37277 [Matou Zouken]`s elder son, he is unfit to be the family heir, because he has very few Magic Circuits, and is considered a failure. Therefore, Kariya was supposed to inherit the position of family head, but he severed ties with the Matou out of disgust.\nSome years after Kariya left, Byakuya would eventually meet and marry a woman with the proper traits to give birth to a child more suited to be a magus, but this child, Shinji, was only marginally better. For that reason, he was considered even more of a failure. At the time the events of the http://anidb.net/a8160 [first] and http://anidb.net/a8880 [second] seasons of Fate/Zero take place, he is already a broken, depressed alcoholic. Since Shinji wasn`t good enough to inherit the family either, Zouken adopted Sakura into the family, and placed Byakuya in charge of supervising her worm \"training\".",
