  "description" : "Kanoe Kirie is a member of the Paranormal Investigations Club. Her grandmother was Kanoe Yuuko`s younger sister, and so far she is the only other character who can see Yuuko, besides Niiya Teiichi. She originally believed Yuuko to be an evil spirit, until she learned that the demonic appearance she perceived Yuuko to sometimes have was only a projection of her own fear. Being related by blood, she looks quite a bit like Yuuko, except that she cuts her hair short, and her bosom is much less substantial, the latter fact being the source of much of her insecurity.",
