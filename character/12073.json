  "description" : "The most humorously-drawn character in the series, Dr. Sado is frequently a source of comic relief, usually through pratfalls resulting from his love of sake. Though originally a vet (albeit an unsuccessful one), he becomes the ship`s surgeon. He is good humored and always willing to give advice, but he can become deadly earnest when chiding others` behavior.",
