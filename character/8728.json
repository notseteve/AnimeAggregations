  "description" : "The Forest Spirit, known in the Japanese version as Shishigami, is the ancient spirit of the forest. During the day, the Forest Spirit resembles a great elegant stag with many antlers, bird-like feet, and a long deer-like face with features similar to those of a baboon. The Forest Spirit is protected by the Wolf Clan. As he walks, flowers bloom up at his feet, though they quickly wither and die. He is capable of both giving life and taking it away, which includes healing wounds.\nAt sunset, the Forest Spirit becomes the Nightwalker (known as Daidarabotchi in the Japanese version), a huge god in a humanoid form that appears to be made out of stars, with a long pointed face and tentacle-like spikes on the back.",
