  "description" : "Urey Rockbell was the father of http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell] and the son of http://anidb.net/ch10164 [Pinako Rockbell]. He grew up, lived and worked in Resembool as a surgeon alongside his wife, http://anidb.net/ch16495 [Sara Rockbell]. When the Ishval Civil War reached its peak, the two Doctors Rockbell reluctantly left their family home in Resembool to help treat the wounded on the front lines. Though both Amestrian, the Rockbells were rather well known in the Kanda region of Ishval for treating the injured on either side of the conflict. Though many, including http://anidb.net/ch10165 [Doctors Marcoh] and http://anidb.net/ch14964 [Knox], viewed them as a medical inspiration and several Ishvalan people owe their lives to the husband and wife medical team, officials the Amestrian military began to view their humanitarian effort as a nuisance and sought to have them killed. In the manga, http://anidb.net/ch14594 [Solf J. Kimblee] is unofficially ordered to kill them and stage their deaths as an accident so that the military would not be forced to waste resources ensuring their protection as humanitarians of their nation, but before the Red Lotus Alchemist could arrive on the scene, the Rockbells are killed by http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar], who had just awakened in their makeshift medical centre and was driven into a violent rage upon learning that his brother was dead. In the 2003 anime series, the Rockbells are officially ordered executed as insurgents because their Ishvalan patients would return to the battlefield after treatment. http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] is ordered to carry out the execution against his will.",
