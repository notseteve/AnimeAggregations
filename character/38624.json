  "description" : "A girl who has the power to use Symphogear armor, which uses music to fight off against aliens known as Noise. She was formally a part of a duo known as ZweiWing, but her partner, Kanade, sacrificed herself fighting the Noise and she has since been fighting the Noise alone. After the death of her partner Kanade, to whom she is rather attached with after witnessing Kanade`s urge to fight the noise, Tsubasa became quiet, cold and aloof. She is very reluctant to work with Hibiki, refusing to accept her as Kanade`s replacement, but she and Hibiki eventually get to be good friends. She is also a rather popular pop idol. Her first name means \"Wing\", while her family name means \"Crying Wind\".\nSource: Wiki",
