  "description" : "The Death Scythe formerly in charge of Oceania. In light of the current situation concerning the resurrection of Asura, Marie`s duties have been assigned to Yumi. Marie is so obsessed with the idea of marriage and retiring that she would consider marrying a toilet. After Yumi talked her out of it, she crushed the toilet, as she viewed it would be unfaithful. An aura was seen coming from her hand, implying that her hand transforms into some sort of smashing weapon. Marie is partnered with Stein since her soul wavelength has a calming effect. This possibly relates to the fact that Frankenstein, on whom Dr. Stein is based, is frequently seen with a hammer, which implies that that is her weapon form. Her last name is derived from the legendary hammer of Thor, Mjöllnir. Her nickname is \"Crushing Weapon Marie\". She wears an eyepatch with a thunderbolt insignia, leading one to believe that she may use electricity.",
