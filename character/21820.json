  "description" : "The witch who protects Hanna-Justina Marseille`s back and the sky above her as consort . While she might look childish, her personality is mother-like and she`s good at taking care of others.\n\"A good kid\" according to Marseille.\nWhile she is obviously skilled enough to keep up even with Marseille`s sometimes irregular maneuvers, she always prioritizes helping Marseille raise her score rather than achieve something on her own, and is fully devoted to being Marseille`s consort.\nHer feelings for Marseille could be describe as a something close to worship, and while she takes great care in fulfilling her part as a support, she maintains a distance in private.\nShe never felt proud of her own achievements, even when she gained the title of an ace after downing 6 enemies, which she considered Marseille`s leftovers.\nWhen Marseille was ordered to form a joint aviation corps \"Afrika\" by Captain Katou of the Fuso Army, Raisa befriended Sergent Inagaki from the same unit and took it upon herself as her mentor.",
