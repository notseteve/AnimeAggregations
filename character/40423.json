It then attacked and destroyed the Team Rocket locomotive by using Will-O-Wisp.\n2-on-2 Battle against Satoshi and Dent\nAs Cilan completed the stamp rally, he got the opportunity to battle the Subway Masters. Subway Boss Ingo sent out his Chandelure to battle against Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Tepig. The battle started off slowly for the Subway Masters as Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Tepig worked well together. Subway Boss Emmet`s Eelektross and Subway Boss Ingo`s Chandelure fought back though as Subway Boss Ingo`s Chandelure used Smog to make it harder for Cilan and Ash`s Pokémon to hit them accurately. Subway Boss Emmet`s Eelektross then used Thunderbolt on the handrail in order to paralyze Cilan`s Pansage who then fell on Ash`s Tepig. Subway Boss Ingo`s Chandelure then used Psychic to help finish them off and give the Subway Masters the win in the 2-on-2 battle.",
