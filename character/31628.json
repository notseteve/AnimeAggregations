  "description" : "Amy`s Druddigon was raging in the nearby forest while Ash and Iris were battling with their Pok√©mon. Amy arrived on the scene to try to calm it down but it took off into the forest. With Iris`s help, Amy and her Crimgan were reunited as Iris managed to take off the wire that was wrapped around its leg.\nAmy`s Druddigon and Iris`s Axew were captured by Team Rocket but Iris`s Axew managed to master its Dragon Rage which was powerful enough to crash their flying transport mecha and allow them to escape. In the following battle against Team Rocket, Amy`s Druddigon learned Draco Meteor which proved to be powerful enough to knock out James`s Yamask with a direct hit from one of the meteorites.",
