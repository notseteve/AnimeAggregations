  "description" : "Shalltear Bloodfallen is the first, second and third floor guardian. She is a true vampire and the Floor Guardian of the first to third floors in the Great Tomb of Nazarick. She was created by Peroroncino.\nShalltear is the strongest of the floor guardians and is completely loyal to Ainz and is also a love rival to Albedo for his affections. She takes great joy in being able to prove her worth and fantasizes about the praise she expects to receive. When a situation doesn`t go in her favor, she panics about the scolding she believes that she will get.\nSource: Overlord Wikia",
