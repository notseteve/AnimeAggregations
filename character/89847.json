  "description" : "Tokisaka Kuroumaru, formerly a part of a clan of Immortal Hunters with demi-human origins, is a UQ Holder member and the closest companion of Konoe Touta. Kuroumaru so far has demonstrated a kind, and easy-going personality, and is quickly able to make friends.\nKuroumaru is genderless; meaning that he does not posses the physical sexual properties of either male or female, due to his demonic lineage as part of the Yatagarasu, who grow genderless until their 16th birthday, whereupon they can choose to either become a male or a female.\nSource: UQ Holder Wiki",
