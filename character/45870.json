  "description" : "After Ash`s Scraggy defeated Brycen`s Vanillish, Brycen`s Cryogonal was sent out to battle. Ash`s Scraggy wasn`t able to defend itself against Brycen`s Cryogonal`s very fast and accurate Rapid Spin. It also made it hard for Ash`s Scraggy to attack it. Ash`s Scraggy ended up getting knocked out by Aurora Beam.\nAsh`s Pignite was then sent out to battle Brycen`s Cryogonal and like Ash`s Scraggy, it had a hard time attacking and defending against Rapid Spin. The Rapid Spin was strengthened to ward off and mitigate disadvantageous moves and Brycen countermeasures were almost perfect. It wasn`t until Ash realized they could use Fire Pledge at the center of the rotation of Rapid Spin to knock it off. The strategy worked and Brycen`s Cryogonal was knocked out.",
