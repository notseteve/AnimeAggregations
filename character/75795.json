  "description" : "Sawyer`s Bagon was revealed as Sawyer`s trump card in the Double Battle against Ash. While waiting for Serena and Bonnie to look at the clothes at the Laverre Gym, Ash challenged Sawyer to a battle and the two decided on a Double Battle which featured Ash`s Frogadier and Ash`s Hawlucha VS Sawyer`s Bagon and Sawyer`s Treecko. Despite a type advantage, Ash`s battles are unpredictable because he negates type disadvantages like they are nothing and due to this and Sawyer lack of Double Battle experience, Ash easily won the match. He was grateful to battle though and gain the experience.\nAs part of an established custom at Valerie`s cloth collection show debuts, Valerie picks one person to battle with. She chose Sawyer and told him if he defeated her, she would give him a Gym badge. Sawyer`s Bagon was sent out to battle against Valerie`s Spritzee. Unfortunately for Sawyer, he was unable to defeat her but was grateful for the experience and vowed to return to defeat her.\nSawyer`s Shelgon was briefly seen battling against Ash`s Hawlucha in the first match-up of a 3-on-3 batle and was defeated by its Flying Press. It is the evolved form of Sawyer`s Bagon.",
