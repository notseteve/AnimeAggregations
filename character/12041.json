  "description" : "Shiro is the other, more na√Øve half of the boy duo he forms with Kuro. Far from pure, Shiro is clearly still a child, helpless, emotional and open to the world, but paradoxically all-knowing, in tune with the poetry of the streets. Shiro`s mind is a blank state, and his focus is on the simple, sensory things he likes - things that are soft, things that are shiny. Although Shiro senses that the world is falling apart around the two boys, he isn`t prepared to deal with it, and loses his tenuous grasp on reality as events unfold. Shiro needs Kuro to survive.",
