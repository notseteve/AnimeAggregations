  "description" : "Mai is depicted with short red hair and a rather large bust. She is typically cast as a sisterly friend of Mikoto, the guardian of her brother Takumi Tokiha, a close friend to Natsuki Kuga but usually at odds with her, and a potential love interest of Yuuichi Tate and Reito Kanzaki. She is associated with fire, and in all series wields 4 large golden rings with magatama as weapons. She also uses a mitsu tomoe as her symbol. She has a fear of spiders in both anime and manga. Running gags include Mikoto burying her face in Mai`s chest or Mikoto otherwise being possessive of her, Mai`s bust size, and her cooking abilities.",
