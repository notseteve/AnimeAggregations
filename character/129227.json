  "description" : "Magearna was found in an antique store and brought home by Lillie`s father. It is theorized that Magearna’s core is on its chest and is called the Soul-Heart. There’s documentation that says Magearna’s power and mobility derive from the life forces of Pokémon but at the time of Professor Mohn research, there was no proof of this.\nLillie`s father was conducting experiments with the hopes of getting Magearna to be active again by using the most advanced science of his time while drawing from the science of ancient times.",
