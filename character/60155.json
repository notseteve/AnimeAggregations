  "description" : "Mondo`s Beartic participated in the Pokémon Sumo which was part of the festival on Harvest Island that celebrates the harvest of fruit. In the first round of the tournament, it was matched up against Iris` Dragonite. It ended up defeating Iris` Dragonite as its tail touched the field before throwing Tunbear. Mondo`s Beartic was later eliminated in a round that was not shown. Since Pokémon attacks were banned from the competition, none of Mondo`s Beartic moves are confirmed.",
