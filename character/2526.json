  "description" : "Karen is usually a very shy and timid girl who is even prone to passing out (called \"The `nyu`s,\" for the syllable she utters before eventually passing out) when a situation gets too intense for her to handle. She frequently calls people by a title, such as calling Maiku, \"Mr. Maiku\", or \"Maiku-San\" in the Japanese version. Like Miina, she also develops feelings for Maiku, though she doesn`t act on them for the same reasons.",
