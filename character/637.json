  "description" : "Swinub is a pig covered in brown fur with dark brown stripes, and is found in icy areas. It roots around with its nose to find food, its favorite being a certain mushroom that grows under dead grass. Swinub`s nose is so tough that even the frozen ground poses no problem. Occasionally, it will find hot springs while rooting around in the ground. In the anime, Dawn acquires a Swinub she met in Mr. Backlot`s garden, after it saved her and the group`s Pok√©mon from Team Rocket.",
