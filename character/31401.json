  "description" : "Onigawara Rikushirou is Mao`s grandfather, and he gave her the green clover-shaped pin as a present for her eighth birthday. He is also the head of the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). Rikushirou is something of a doting grandfather (he had a weapon-free tank built especially for Mao, saying that his granddaughter deserved only the best toys), but he insists that Mao address him as `Chief of Staff` instead of `Grandpa`. His name is a play on words meaning \"warrior of the land\".",
