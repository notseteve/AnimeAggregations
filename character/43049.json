  "description" : "Amelda (アメルダ) is Dartz`s second henchman. Amelda lived in a town in the middle of a war as a child, leading a resistance group with his brother after their parents disappear. When his brother is lost during an attack on the town, Amelda blames Kaiba Corporation, who financed the weapons in that attack. (In the Japanese version, both his parents and brother were killed.) In reality, the weapons were funded by Dartz. To this end, Amelda targets Seto Kaiba, but when Alister learns of his bond with his own brother Mokuba, he becomes more sympathetic and willingly loses the duel to ensure Mokuba will not have to bear losing his brother as he did. Kaiba, also understanding Amelda`s grudge towards him now, carries his body to safety after the duel, and Amelda is restored when Dartz is defeated.\nAmelda uses a Toon deck while pretending to be Maximillion Pegasus, relying on the Toon monsters and exploiting their various powers such as direct attacks. When revealed, Amelda changes to a Pyro deck relying on Gorlag and its power to revive the monsters it destroys. In his second duel, he uses an Army deck of Machine monsters like KC-1 Krayton and Spell Canceler, highlighted by Air Fortress Ziggurat and the Toy Robot Tokens it spawns, both of which are based on an action figure his brother owned.\nSource: wiki",
