  "description" : "Kubota is an army Intelligence Officer and former colleague of http://anidb.net/ch1588 [Aramaki]. He often provides Aramaki with inside information. He appears to be of the same JGSDF Academy Class as Chief Aramaki, and appears to have equivalent rank (Colonel), though he is also interested in advancing his career politically, often handing unpleasant tasks over to http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9] in order to prevent blame for `dirty business` being officially attached to his record of conduct.",
