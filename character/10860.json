  "description" : "Orphaned in his younger years, Moominpappa is a somewhat restless soul who left the orphanage to venture out into the world in his youth but has now settled down, determined to be a responsible father to his family. He is almost always wearing his black top-hat, inside which is painted, \"M.P. from your http://anidb.net/ch10859 [M.M.]\" to differentiate it from all the other top hats in the world. Moominpappa also lived on a ship with three Hattifatteners for a few days, observing their behavior.\nSource: Wikipedia",
