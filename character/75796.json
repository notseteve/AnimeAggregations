  "description" : "As part of an established custom at Valerie`s cloth collection show debuts, Valerie picks one person to battle with. She chose Scottie and told him if he defeated her, she would give him a Gym badge. Scottie`s Bagon was sent out to battle against Valerie`s Spritzee. Unfortunately for Scottie, he was unable to defeat her but was grateful for the experience and vowed to return to defeat her.\nAfter Valerie`s Sylveon was defeated, Valerie`s Spritzee was matched up against Ash`s Fletchinder. The match was dominated by Valerie`s Spritzee Trick Room. Ash Ketchum kept instructing Fletchinder to use Flame Charge despite being under Trick Room`s effects which actually has the opposite effect and lowers its speed. Ash`s Fletchinder kept enduring attacks until the effects of Trick Room had warn off and he hoped that he could settle the match in one go but unfortunately the strategy didn`t pay off as Valerie`s Spritzee endured the Giga Impact and Steel Wing and knocked out Fletchinder with a Moon Blast.\nIn the final match up, Ash`s Hawlucha was sent out to face a weakened Spritzee. Once again Trick Room dominated the match-up but Ash`s Hawlucha had learned a new move, X-Scissor which was able to shatter Trick Room and its effects on the playing field. Valerie was surprised and it wasn`t much later that Ash`s Hawlucha took over the match and knocked out Valerie`s Spritzee with a powerful High Jump Kick.",
