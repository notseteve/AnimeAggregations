  "description" : "Empoleon is the final evolution of the Piplup evolutionary line. The length of the three horns extending from the beak symbolize an Empoleon`s strength; generally, the longer the horns are, the stronger the Pok√©mon is. Also, the biggest Empoleon`s horns in a colony symbolizes the leader. Empoleon can swim at the speed of a jet boat, and the tips of its wings are so sharp that it is said they can destroy entire slabs of drift ice.",
