  "description" : "Zangulus is a mercenary and a swordsman of considerable skill. Although he cannot use magic, Zangulus carries a weapon called the Howling Sword, a magical sword created by Rezo that can shoot great gusts of wind. He had originally been hired - along with the sorcerer Vrumugun - as a bounty hunter by Eris and Copy Rezo to capture Lina Inverse, Gourry Gabriev, and Zelgadis Greywords, and bring them to Sairaag. He soon became obsessed with fighting Gourry, to see who was the better swordsman.\nHe and Gourry eventually had a duel in Rezo`s lab, but after Gourry won in the end, Zangulus left on his way. He later reappeared towards the end of Slayers NEXT, looking for a rematch. However, since Gourry was being held prisoner by Hellmaster Phibrizzo at the time, Zangulus did not get a chance to properly duel him a second time. He did, however, help Lina and the others fight Hellmaster.\nIt was during this time that Zangulus met and fell in love with http://anidb.net/ch7879 [Martina Zoana Mel Navratilova], whom he married after the battle with Hellmaster.\nZangulus is a character created by the anime staff, as he does not appear in the original novels or the manga. He can still be considered a canon character, as the series` plot and cast was written, supervised and approved by Hajime Kanzaka.",
