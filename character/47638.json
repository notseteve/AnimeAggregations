  "description" : "The protagonist of the story, he possesses a strange power that allows him to seal the powers of a Spirit in his body with a kiss; however, the seal will only work if the Spirit holds enough trust or affection toward him to allow it. This ability to seal and contain 99% of a spirit`s power might have been given to him by Phantom soon after it turned Kotori into the spirit Efreet. After sealing a Spirit`s powers, there will be an invisible link connecting him and the Spirit, through which a portion of the sealed power will flow back to the Spirit if said Spirit`s mental state becomes unstable, and back to Shidou once the Spirit`s mental state restabilizes. So the more angry/distraught/unhappy a spirit is the more power she takes back temporarily while conversely the happier/content/joyful a spirit the more her power level doesn`t rise from the minimum level of 1%.\nAbandoned by his birth mother, he lives with his foster sister Kotori. He was in despair for a time after being abandoned and subsequently adopted, which made him sensitive to similar feelings from others and wanting to bring them out of it, fuelling his desire to save the Spirits. His real younger sister is Takamiya Mana.",
