  "description" : "One of http://anidb.net/ch81326 [Ami]`s best friends. Although her appearance makes it seem like she`s a serious and good student, the opposite is true. She gives Ami her first contraceptives and it was due to her and Satomi`s bad influence that Ami ends up drinking alcohol for the first time. Due to her and Satomi`s actions, Ami`s life took a turn for the worse when, unaware of what happened between http://anidb.net/ch113512 [Hiroshi] and Ami, they took Ami to a disco in order to get her a boy and get laid, inadvertently leaving her alone and prey to http://anidb.net/ch81323 [Kouno], a well known philanderer that even they were wary of. Despite that, Kyouko is a good friend and, when she learns the truth, she encourages Ami to keep her relationship with Hiroshi since she knows how deep her affection for her stepbrother runs and tries to cheer Ami up when she gets depressed.",
