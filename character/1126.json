  "description" : "Chizuru is a carefree second year female student at Kouta`s school. She appears to be a normal, albeit big-breasted, teenage girl, but she is in fact a 400-year-old powerful kitsune. When she changes form, her hair goes from black to blond and she gains fox ears and a tail. She is constantly hanging around and on Kouta; he is the only male she acts genuinely towards. She loves Kouta very much and wants to enter a \"relationship of sin\" with him. She is a very forward person and makes almost constant sexual suggestions and actions toward Kouta. She is also a terrible cook, though she improves later on, and shows some interest in masochism.",
