  "description" : "This command mobile suit is used by leaders of Crossbone Vanguard reconnaissance teams. The Dahgi Iris is equipped with a battery of cameras and precision sensors, and its information-processing capabilities allow it to search as wide an area as five or six ordinary mobile suits. Since the energy emissions of a beam shield might interfere with its delicate sensors and electronics, the Dahgi Iris carries a traditional shield, and uses its surplus energy to generate additional thrust.\nOne Dahgi Iris unit was piloted by Annamarie Bourget, who later defected to the Earth Federation Forces during the Crossbone Vanguard invasion of UC 0123. Annamarie`s Dahgi Iris was then repainted into an off-yellow color to more easily distinguish it from its loyal Crossbone counterparts.",
