  "description" : "Fukuzawa Yukichi (福澤 諭吉, January 10, 1835 – February 3, 1901) was a Japanese author, writer, teacher, translator, entrepreneur, journalist, and leader who founded Keio University, Jiji-Shinpō (a newspaper) and the Institute for Study of Infectious Diseases. Fukuzawa was an early Japanese advocate for reform. Fukuzawa`s ideas about the organization of government and the structure of social institutions made a lasting impression on a rapidly changing Japan during the Meiji period. Fukuzawa is regarded as one of the founders of modern Japan and appears on the 10,000 yen banknote. [Source: Wikipedia]",
