  "description" : "Ryohei Sasagawa is the 15-year-old passionate member of the boxing club at Namimori Middle School. He constantly asks others he believe are strong to join his club, most notably Tsuna. In response, Reborn wants to recruit him into Tsuna`s family. Every time he sees Tsuna and his family doing something strange, he gets fired up and always wants to be a part of it. Because of his energetic character, however, he does not understand the full extent of Tsuna`s connection with the Mafia, but still does everything that he can to protect him and fights with as much spirit and confidence as the others. Proficient in hand-to-hand combat, his boxing training lead to his peak physical condition. He is a habit of always saying \"to the extreme\" as a single response or as an ending to his sentences.",
