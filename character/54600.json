  "description" : "Ursula Callistis is an astrology teacher at Luna Nova.\nHer real identity is Chariot du Nord, a famous witch and alumni of Luna Nova who performed under the name http://anidb.net/ch53389 [Shiny Chariot] and inspired http://anidb.net/ch52146 [Akko] to become a witch. Her chosen mission was to use her magic skills to bring joy to people`s hearts. She mysteriously disappeared from the public eye ten years ago after her former friend http://anidb.net/ch89470 [Croix] tricked her into employing a sinister type of magic, which stripped Akko of her latent magical powers as a child. Now living and teaching incognito at Luna Nova, she takes Akko as a personal student after she notices her strong desire to become a witch, which enables her to use the Shiny Rod and unseal the lost seven words to the Grand Triskelion, in order to make up for her guilt.\nSource: Wikipedia",
