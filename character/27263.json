Around its eyes, there is a black area resembling a bandit`s mask, or a stylized pair of sunglasses. Its belly has gray scales. With powerful jaws that can bite the body off an automobile, it doesn`t let any prey escape. With eyes like binoculars, they can see things magnified at a distance.\nThe Escapist listed Krookodile as one of the new Pokémon with \"really cool designs\", describing it as a \"sunglasses-wearing crocodile\".",
