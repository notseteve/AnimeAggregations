Was a friend of http://anidb.net/ch9899 [Reki] in the past.\nHis name Hyouko probably is written \"雹湖\" in kanji (with \"雹\" = \"hyou\" = \"hail\", i. e. falling ice balls, and \"湖\" = \"ko\" = \"lake\") as he explains during episode 7 when Rakka mistakes his name for \"hiyoko\" (\"雛\" = \"chicken\", not exactly the way a rough young male likes to be addressed).\nFive years ago Hyouko tried to help Reki climb over the wall of the town of Guri; he fell down a ladder in the process and was severely injured. Both he and Reki were enjoined from visiting the other`s nest because of this incident.",
