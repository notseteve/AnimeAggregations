  "description" : "Doumeki Haruka is http://anidb.net/ch861 [Doumeki Shizuka]`s grandfather and the Shinto priest of the shrine where Shizuka now lives. He died sometime ago but he is always mentioned in Shizuka`s stories. The reason for his death hasn`t been mentioned yet. Haruka looks strikingly like Shizuka, but he has a somewhat more cheerful and outgoing personality than his grandson. He seems to have taught Shizuka a lot of stories regarding folklore, mythology and shrine practices. He has also an immense library that now Shizuka uses and keeps.\nAs the priest of that shrine, he had the power to exorcise spirits and see them as well, an ability passed on to Shizuka (although Shizuka could not see spirits). His style of exorcising spirits, like Shizuka`s, was shooting a bow and arrow made of chi. When http://anidb.net/ch859 [Yuuko] saw the wards Haruka had made for the library she indicated that they were of high quality, attesting to his skill and knowledge of the occult.",
