  "description" : "Echidna is a wild elf from the southern jungles with over 500 years of battle experience. In the past, she led the Assassins of the Fang and was Irma`s former teacher, but is now a mercenary. She is considered a favorite to win the Queen`s Blade tournament, but her current employer is unknown; all that is certain is that she herself has no interest in the throne. She was hired to protect Leina during the tournament, but she abandoned her mission to rescue Irma from her execution. She is an expert with blades, and has a pet snake named Keltan that she wears as a thong, having it help her fight on occasion. In addition, her armor has a snake motif.\nEchidna is named after the Greek mythological creature Echidna, whose half-snake appearance is also an homage to her snake-themed armor.\nSource: Wiki",
