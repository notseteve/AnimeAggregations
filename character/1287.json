  "description" : "The only other undine with Aria Company, Alicia is one of the three Water Fairies of Neo-Venezia, called the \"Snow White\" (白き妖精[スノーホワイト], Shiroki Yousei, lit. \"White Fairy\"). At the start of the series, she is 19 and the most popular undine in the city. Like Akari, she is relaxed and easy-going, but she also likes to tease others (especially her childhood friend Akira). Her favorite phrase is Ara Ara (\"Well Well\") and she frequently giggles, to Akira`s annoyance.",
