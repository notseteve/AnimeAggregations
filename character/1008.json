  "description" : "Whiscash is a whale-like Pokémon. It has a dark-blue body, large round eyes, and thick light-blue lips, which usually form a smile. Attached on both cheeks are two long, yellow whiskers, which is why the Pokédex describes them as \"Whiskers Pokémon\". In its shiny version, Whiscash` belly and whiskers have turned dark red, and its body black.\nDespite its amusing appearance, Whiscash is an extremely violent and territorial Pokémon. It makes its nest at the bottom of ponds or swamps, where it sleeps throughout the day. At night, it awakes, after which it will eat continually. Whiscash will easily claim a large pond or swamp as its exclusive territory. If an intruder approaches it, Whiscash will thrash about, triggering massive earthquakes with a radius of over three miles. Whiscash also has the ability to predict real earthquakes.\nWhishcash, Namazun in the Japanese games, is clearly based upon the Namazu (\"catfish\") in Japanese mythology. The creature lives in the mud beneath the earth, and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the creature with a stone. If Kashima lets his guard fall however, Namazu will be set loose and cause earthquakes.\nWhiscash has a mark similar to a \"W\" on its head. Since its Japanese name does not contain a \"W\", many believe it stands for \"Widiot\", which matches its vacant expression.",
