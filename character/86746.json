At the top of its head is a large purple mushroom with pale green oval markings. Unlike its pre-evolution, it has a mouth. It is a medium-sized black mouth.\nIt emits strange lights that confuse people that enter the forest that it inhabits, making sure they can never find their way home again. Its flickering spores cause drowsiness. This Pokémon takes advantage when its prey is asleep to feed on them by sucking in their energy.",
