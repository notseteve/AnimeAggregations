  "description" : "A new amphibious combat mobile suit designed and built by the Earth Federation Forces, the RMS-192M Zaku Mariner is an improved descendant of the old Principality of Zeon`s MS-06M Zaku Marine Type used in the One Year War. Armed with a total of 14 SUBROC (SUBmarine ROCket) launchers in its shoulders and backpack, as well as a magnet harken shocking cable weapon for melee combat, and a handheld spray missile gun, the Zaku Mariner packs more firepower than its Zaku Marine Type predecessor. In addition to being a better performer in terms of power, the backpack can be ejected in order for the Mariner to go ashore and conduct limited ground combat (a similar feature is also utilized by the later Neo Zeon AMS-129M Zee Zulu). However, the Federation Forces never get to deploy these units; instead, they fall into the hands of Neo Zeon, who acquire them with the capture of several Federation bases following their Earth invasion during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088. Zeon remnants also make use of the Zaku Mariner during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.\nSource: mahq.net",
