  "description" : "Julia is Let`s girlfriend, somewhat of a feisty one who`s loud, rowdy, and not above beating people up to get her way, which is a polar opposite to the cool and calm Let. Initially in the story Julia is shown to have become a dragon as she had failed to pass the dragon trial. Julia is saved by Let and turned back to normal using a potion given by Alice. She can usually be found at a bar. A sisterly figure to Haru`s party. She was first thought to be a kind and shy girl in Let`s flashbacks. In the anime her hair is green.",
