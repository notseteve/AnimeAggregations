  "description" : "Gurkinn`s Lucario can Mega Evolve into Mega Lucario. It tried to help Korrina`s Lucario learn how to control its rampaging in a Mega Evolution battle. Gurkinn`s Lucario knows its Wave thoroughly and during the battle against Korrina`s Lucario, the power of its Wave alone was enough to block attacks. The match didn`t last long as Gurkinn`s Lucario was far more experienced battling in its Mega form and knew how to use its Wave Guidance to assist it.",
