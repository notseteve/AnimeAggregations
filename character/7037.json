  "description" : "Dr. Kitaguchi maintains the understaffed and under-stocked sick bay of the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. A great lover of alcohol in all its form, he even uses it to anesthetize and sterilize his patients. While only 33 years old, Kitaguchi claims to have a 30-year drinking habit and proclaims that he performs better in surgery when he`s liquored up.\nWith the arrival of http://anidb.net/ch7039 [Harumi], he becomes the envy of the entire male crew. He and http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] are drinking buddies, and he is one of the few crew members to gain a deep understanding of Tylor`s true nature early on. He claims the reason he became a doctor was because \"it`s better than being a patient.\"",
