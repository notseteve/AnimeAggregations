  "description" : "Donato Porpora is a powerful Russian http://anidb.net/t7110 [ghoul] captured by http://anidb.net/ch92823 [Urie]`s father and imprisoned by http://anidb.net/ch69612 [CCG], who once posed as a Catholic priest and raised http://anidb.net/ch66561 [Amon Koutarou]. He is considered a valuable source of information on other ghouls, due to having no loyalty to others. His favorite victims were the orphans he raised. Strangely, he spared Amon after the boy caught him butchering another child. This fact continues to haunt Amon. Once the Cochlea is breached after http://anidb.net/ch92821 [Haise]`s betrayal, he manages to escape and rejoin his fellow Clowns.\nSource: Wikipedia",
