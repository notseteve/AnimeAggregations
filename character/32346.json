  "description" : "Hayasaka Shusui is Ouka`s younger twin brother. Like his sister, he is depicted as very smart, but unlike his sister, is quick to anger. Shusui is Ginsei High`s best student at kendo, his speciality being the notoriously difficult reverse do. He is also vice president of the student council under Ouka, and Kazuki claims he`s number one in terms of genital size. His eyes are shown as fierce and maniacal at times, as noted by Dr. Butterfly and himself. After Shusui is defeated by Kazuki, he surrenders his kakugane to Captain Bravo and returns to his old kendo teacher to try and overcome his demons, and then later becomes an Alchemy Warrior. In the anime, Shusui is recruited by Chitose into the team dispatched to take out Victor. He is later seen in \"Buso Renkin Period\" defeating the cloned Mita in battle. In \"Buso Renkin After\", Kazuki wishes him luck at kendo camp.",
