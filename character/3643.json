  "description" : "Mizuho is the main protagonist who transfers to an all-girl`s school per his grandfather`s will and must crossdress in order to attend. He already looks very androgynous, so the change thankfully isn`t obvious to the other members of the school. However, Mizuho is always nervous about being found out and constantly worries that it will happen. In spite of this, he was well received on his first day at school and has already become very popular among the students. At first he was shocked when he found out about the will, but with the help of his childhood friend Mariya Mikado, who also attends the school, he was able to resign himself to transferring to the school.",
