  "description" : "FÃ¼hrer King Bradley is the head of the State Military and King of Amestris. Though initially portrayed as a kindly ruler, he is later revealed to be a homunculus. Though his identity as a homunculus differs between the manga and first anime series (he is the homonculus Wrath in the manga and the 2009 anime adaptation, and Pride in the 2003 anime), his weapon of choice is the sword, which he wields with great proficiency. His deadly swordsmanship is further augmented by the \"Ultimate Eye,\" a clairvoyant eye that bears the Ouroboros seal, which is usually covered by an eyepatch. The eye gives him the foresight to see all possible outcomes of a given situation, allowing him to predict the moves of any opponent before they happen, along with being able to see things the normal human eye can not, such as air currents. In both story lines, because homunculi cannot reproduce, Bradley is given a family to keep up appearances: his son, http://anidb.net/ch14960 [Selim Bradley], and a wife he personally chose.",
