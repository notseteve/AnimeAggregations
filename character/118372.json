  "description" : "Although technically Shachou is their leader, Kashira usually takes charge in dire situations. While generally a good person, he is rarely serious and likes to fool around, occasionally so on the expenses of others, unintentionally angering them. He is very courageous, sporty and ready to take great risks in order to save his friends. Tends to fall for girls easily and flirts around without hesitation. Doesn`t really get along with God.\nSource: Wikipedia",
