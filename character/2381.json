For three hundred years Dark`s power has been passed down through the male members of the Niwa family.\nHis demeanour is candid and confident. He is well aware of his good looks and on the surface he could be seen as arrogant. It would be easy to dismiss the deeper, kinder side of his personality. Daisuke and Dark often fight against one another for control.",
