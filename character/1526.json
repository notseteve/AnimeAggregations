  "description" : "Shitou Megumi is http://anidb.net/ch1513 [Haruka]`s younger sister.\nShe initially protests Ayato living with her, Haruka, and their uncle, but she does her best to help Ayato feel at home, and develops a crush on Ayato as the series progresses. She often serves pocky and other snacks, and introduces Ayato to ramune. Although seemingly energetic and upbeat, she has many internal issues. She did not fit in well in school, so she joined TERRA as a trainee. She would later be promoted to the rank of a full officer.\nShe initially has a crush on Yakumo Souichi, but gives up on him when she finds out that he is seeing her friend, Hotal Kim. She feels as if she is constantly living in her sister`s shadow, and this comes to a head when she learns that Ayato and Haruka had a relationship when they were younger, as by the end of the series she has developed a crush on Ayato. In the end, she openly renounces her feelings for Ayato for the sake of her sister.\nIn the movie, as in the series, Megumi helps make Ayato feel at home, but does not fall in love with Ayato or Yagumo â€” at least not in the scenes shown.\nIn the manga, Megumi and Kim have minor roles as classmates, \"bodyguards\" and observers of Reika.",
