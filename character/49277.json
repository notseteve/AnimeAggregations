  "description" : "Over 4 kilometers long, the massive Fleet Flagship Space Carrier is the largest warship in the Varauta forces. This enormous vessel serves as the command ship for the 502 vessels (8,964 fighters) of the Varauta fleet and also operates as a mobile fortress to service and supply those many smaller warships in the Varauta forces. Both halves of the ship contain giant docks which can accommodate several large warships or dozens of smaller ships, all simultaneously. The Fleet Flagship also contains various hangars and linear catapults to accommodate and deploy nearly 500 fighting and support spacecraft. The Space Carrier is also heavily armed with numerous powerful anti-ship high-angle beam cannons for combat against any enemy warships. During the Protodeviln War that began in 2045 the Protodeviln leader http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti] commanded the Varauta forces from aboard this ship, leading his fleet in numerous battles against the UN Spacy forces.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/varauta-fleetflagship.htm",
