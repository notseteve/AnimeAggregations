His name in the Japanese version is based of the French word for Monday (lundi).\nHe was afraid that the Pokémon that Première would bring to the school would hurt him, so he decided to avoid them. He had an encounter with some Pokémon that frightened him. It wasn`t until he became friends with Ash`s Froakie that he was no longer afraid of Pokémon. He helped rescue Pikachu and Première`s Sylveon after they were stolen by Rocket Gang.",
