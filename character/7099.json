  "description" : "Kenta Usui is the first person to have found out Karin`s secret. Under Anju`s suggestion, the Maaka family make him an ally, telling him that if he kept their secret and looked after Karin, they wouldn`t erase his memory. Kenta and his mother live in a one room apartment and do not have much money. Consequently Kenta can`t afford three meals a day, which means he`s often hungry during the middle of the day. Karin, realizing this, begins making him a bento every day.\nKenta works with Karin part-time at Julian`s restaurant, and gets all the hours he can to support himself and his mother. He dreams of being a model citizen with a family and a good job. Initially, Kenta is considered scary by most people who meet him, since he has rather startling eyes. His benevolent nature and strong character tend to win people over if they get to know him.",
