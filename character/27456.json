  "description" : "Hydreigon, known as the Brutal Pokémon, is the evolution of Zweilous, and final stage of Deino. Hydreigon is a three-headed bipedal dragon with six wings. It is extremely vicious and destructive as it travels the skies, attacking anything that moves. Its duplicate heads do not have brains, but are used to eat and attack.\nHydreigon appears in the Nintendo 3DS download Pokédex 3D, where it was featured as one of the first collectible Pokémon. A Hydreigon under the ownership of Carlita appeared in Pokémon the Movie: Black - Victini and Reshiram and White - Victini and Zekrom. It appears to have shiny coloration in the White version of the film, while being normal colored in the Black version.\nOfficial Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling used Hydreigon as an example of a unique Pokémon in this generation compared to the safer ones earlier in the game.",
