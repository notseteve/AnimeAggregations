  "description" : "Biscuit Krueger (ビスケット クルーガー) is a Double Star Stone Hunter who Gon and Killua team up with in Greed Island. Although she appears to be a little girl, her true form is actually that of a massive and extremely muscular 57-year-old woman several times the size. Biscuit stays in this young girl form because she hates her actual appearance, but receives a tremendous power boost when she transforms back to her real appearance. Her goal in Greed Island is to obtain a gem found only in the game, Blue Planet. She becomes Gon and Killua`s second teacher, and is also the teacher of Wing, the man who first teaches Nen to Gon and Killua. After the events of Greed Island, Biscuit later helps Gon and Killua train for their battles against Knuckle and Shoot during the Chimera Ant arc.\nSource: Wikipedia",
