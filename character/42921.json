  "description" : "Broly the original and Legendary Super Saiyan. He is born with a power level of ten thousand, a power greater than most elite Saiyan warriors, and he is mentally unsettled as an adult, partially due to the crying of the infant Goku in the incubator next to him when they were born, and partially because his power was so extreme. He eventually becomes the \"Legendary Super Saiyan\" and his destructive tendencies are quelled by a special control device created by scientists for his father, Paragus. After Paragus lures Vegeta, Goku, and their companions to another planet, Broly recalls Goku and goes into a rage, destroying the control device and becoming the unstoppable Legendary Super Saiyan. He effortlessly pummels Super Saiyan Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, and Future Trunks as well as Piccolo before killing his father. He is eventually defeated, but he manages to make his way into an escape pod. He later lands on Earth and goes into a frozen state until the crying of Goten awakens him. He is killed by Goku, Gohan and Goten, though blood samples make their way into the hands of an industrialist, who creates a clone called Bio-Broly. The clone eventually wakes up and becomes mixed with bio-liquid, transforming him into Bio-Broly. He is eventually killed by Goten, Trunks, and Krillin.\nSource: wiki",
