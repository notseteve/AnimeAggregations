  "description" : "Nerv`s predecessor located inside the GeoFront and tasked with research and development of the Evangelion units and the Magi, amongst other things. Branch 3 is located in Germany. Two other branches are located in the USA, and one probably in China. A minor branch is located in Matsushiro, Japan. Many of its facilities and members (including prominently Ikari Gendou, Ikari Yui, Fuyutsuki Kouzou, Soryu Zeppelin Kyouko and Akagi Ritsuko) would become Nerv personnel later. It was converted into Nerv shortly after Akagi Naoko`s death and the MAGI were developed and made operational. The main characters would later see a \"graveyard\" filled with Gehirn`s failed Evangelion prototypes, of which line of research Unit 00 and later Evangelions would be made.",
