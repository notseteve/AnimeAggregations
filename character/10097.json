  "description" : "Hasukawa is an orphan. He was raised by his older brother, Kazuhiro, who also attended Ryokuto Gakuen. As a child, Hasukawa idolized his brother and wanted to enroll at Ryokuto to be more like him.\nAt the start of the series, we see him enrolling into the school, realizing his dream, but he is very late due to a series of freak accidents.\nSadly, all of the personality traits Kazuya prized in his brother (drive, determination, and ambition) have seemingly disappeared. To make matters worse, Hiro has just married Kazuya`s first love, Sumire-chan!\nUnable to live in the same house as the now-frivolous Hiro and his bride, Kazuya moves into the dorms. Little does he know what terrors await him there!",
