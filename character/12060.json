  "description" : "Shizume Genma is a representative working for the Third Chief Clerk in the 2nd Investigative Division of the Statistics Bureau in the MIAC, as well as a Contractor. Despite his status as a contractor, Genma has a habit of saying some odd things many of them implying he is, or was, a child molester,showing in intrest in Suo (who he believes is shion) and has stated to Suo that \"I will take care of your thighs untill they grow hair\". He is shown to be fairly bumbling as well, as he is the only one who still believes Suo is Shion. His ability allows him to cover his body with whatever material he touches in order to form tank armour, taking from the object until he is sufficiently covered. His armored form enhances the power of his punches and protects him from bullets. His remuneration is to have moxibustion treatment each time his power is used. He uses traditional budou. It is later revealed that he is a double agent for the CIA, and is responsible for Youko`s death. He is killed once by Suo and a final time by Mina who stabs him through the head with her sword.\nSource: Wikipedia",
