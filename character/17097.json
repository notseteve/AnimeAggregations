  "description" : "Hedoro is a large, green Amanto, with two white inverted horns and dark eyes with red pupils. He moves in next to the http://anidb.net/ch10409 [Yorozuya] and starts a flower shop (which incidentally gives the whole of Edo hay fever). His appearance completely terrifies Gintoki and friends when he comes over to give a welcome gift (a flower).\nAlthough he looks hideous and frightening, he is in reality a peaceful being with a green thumb, who loves all life, particularly plants and insects. In episode 68, it is revealed that he is afraid of ghosts.",
