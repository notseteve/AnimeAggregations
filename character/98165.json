The tip of its tail, chest, face and tips of its head spikes are fuchsia. On its head are three needles. The side needles and the top of its head have grey nozzles which are capable of firing a glowing adhesive poison. It laughs while targeting opponents with this poison. Poipole`s eyes and mouth give off a cyan glow.\nPoipole originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space, where it is popular as a starter Pokémon. Poipole is capable of understanding human speech after spending enough time with humans. The anime reveals that wild Poipole live in nests that resemble wasp or hornet nests alongside Naganadel.",
