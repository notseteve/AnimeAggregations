  "description" : "Usui Masafumi was Switch`s brother and the original source of the \"Switch\" nickname. A year younger than his brother, he was brilliant with computers and possessed a very scientific mind. He created the speech synthesis software that Switch always uses, though he hadn`t perfected it prior to his death. He was killed by Yukino, who mistakenly believed that he and Sawa were dating. As Yukino`s former boyfriend had left her in part because he fell for Sawa, she intended to make Sawa suffer as she had and thus stabbed Sawa`s supposed-boyfriend Masafumi in the chest.",
