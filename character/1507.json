  "description" : "While the Earth Alliance plays a game of catch up with ZAFT on mobile suit development, it also designs a new type of battleship to complement their mobile suits. Developed in conjunction with Orb`s Morgenroete company, the design of the Archangel class is based on that of Orb`s Izumo class. In addition to carrying mobile suits, the Archangel features many new technologies not seen in other Alliance vessels. The Archangel is capable of atmospheric entry, thanks to an ablative gel that can be spread across the hull. The Archangel also features laminated armor, making it very difficult to seriously damage in battle. In terms of weaponry, the Archangel is a mobile fortress. Its main weapon is the dual \"Lohengrin\" positron blaster cannon housed in the `legs` at the forward end of the ship. The Archangel`s armament includes an array of other weapons, such as \"Gottfried\" beam cannons, \"Valient\" linear cannons, \"Igelstellung\" vulcan guns as well as missile launchers.",
