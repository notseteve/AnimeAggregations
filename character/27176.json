While it still appears to have resemblance to its pre-evolution, Emboar are much more boar-like than pig-like. Additionally, it appears to have beard-like fire that circles its neck and shoulders. It has longer tusks that protruding its jaw and golden adornment. Emboar utilizes the flames on its neck during battle, where it uses its fist to set up combined fire and fighting moves on opponents. When leveling up, it masters up both fighting skills with speed and powers combined.",
