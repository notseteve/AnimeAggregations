  "description" : "Part-time peddler, part-time alchemist working under the Comte de St. Germain, his real name is Giuseppe Balsamo and is first seen selling perfumes in Russia. His travels have given him a taste for fine liquor, which he seems to be more interested in than his alluring partner Lorenza. He is loosely based on the historical occultist and charlatan Alessandro di Cagliostro (1743-1795), although the historical Cagliostro would have been a child during the time period of the anime.",
