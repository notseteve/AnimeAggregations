  "description" : "Switch is the brains and secretary to the Sket-Dan. He is an otaku (no matter how many times he denies it) that has information about everyone in Kaimei-high. Switch appears to be the most serious of the group but his fooling around says other wise. He also has a strong belief in science which is shown through his rivalry against occult lover, Yuuki Reiko. The most unique thing about Switch is that he talks through a computer.",
