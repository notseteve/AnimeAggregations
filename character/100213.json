  "description" : "A girl band made up of 5 childhood friends. When Ran (Vo.) moved to a different class in middle school, the girls made a band so they could still see each other. Now in high school, they love playing in their band, practicing after school and playing live shows. They get along famously and almost never fight. Though they`re still fairly inexperienced, they gained popularity for their powerful performances and strong vocals.\nSource: bandori.fandom.com",
