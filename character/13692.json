While he may look like a kind old man, but beneath this facade lies a heartless man who has no problem of using the lives of innocent children, all in the name Science. He was http://anidb.net/ch12962 [Harumi]`s former boss who trick her and her students to partake in an experiment whose real purpose was to test Esper`s AIM fields going out of control which left her students in a coma. Later in the Toaru Kagaku no Railgun anime, it is revealed that this experiment was in fact part of a larger plan, the Level 6 Ability Crystal project which aims to create a Level 6 Esper. Gensei theorizes those who have potential to become a Level 6 when given Ability Crystals, a by product made from the essences and proteins of comatose espers as result of their AIM fields going out of control, will become a Level 6 esper . His current whereabouts are unknown. As his surname suggest, he is Amata Kihara`s father who was introduced in Volume 12 of the novels.\nHe is also the grandfather of http://anidb.net/ch14937 [Telestina] and used her as a test subject for the Ability Crystals.",
