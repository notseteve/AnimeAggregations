  "description" : "Koga was the Gym Leader of Fuchsia City`s Gym, known officially as the Fuchsia Gym. He is a student of ninjutsu who specializes in Poison-type Pokémon. He handed out the Soul Badge to trainers who defeated him. Later, in the Generation II games, he is promoted to the Elite Four, leaving his daughter in charge of the Gym.\nKoga`s only anime appearance was in the episode \"The Ninja Poké Showdown\".\nKoga is a ninja who trains in an old mansion, the Fuchsia City Gym, in the woods outside Fuchsia City. The Gym is filled with traps such as fake mirrors, invisible walls, pits, and many Voltorb. Aya, Koga`s younger sister, is one of his students.\nAsh, Misty, and Brock managed to overcome the traps in the Gym and Ash was finally able to challenge Koga. Although Ash`s Pidgeotto initially lost to Koga`s newly-evolved Venomoth, prompting Ash to call out Charmander, their match was interrupted when Team Rocket tried to steal Koga`s large supply of Voltorb, although they had raided the Gym with the intent of getting Poison-type Pokémon. Team Rocket was stopped by Psyduck, allowing Ash and Koga to have a rematch. Pitting Charmander against Koga`s Golbat, Ash triumphed and won the Soul Badge.",
