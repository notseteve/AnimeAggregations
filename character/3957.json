  "description" : "After fighting in the war and joining the countless ranks of ronin samurai, Gorobei became a street performer, using his fighting skills to pay for his meals. Desecrating his skills in such poorly thought of jobs is a very dishonourable fate for a samurai, but Gorobei doesn`t care. He`s rooted more in the real world than ideals. His experience as a street performer gives him a greater ability to sense stealth attacks and quickly react on them.",
