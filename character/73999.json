  "description" : "Sawyer is a Pok√©mon Trainer that battled against Clemont in a Gym Battle at the Lumiose Gym. Only the end of the battle was shown where he was defeated by Clemont. He seems to be a beginning trainer as he was surprised how strong Gym Leaders were but was thankful for the Experience. He took notes from the battle for future reference. His name was confirmed in the Japanese closed captions. His first appearance in the anime was in the third Japanese opening.\nIn the original airing of the English dub of XY64, the closed captions listed his name as Scottie. In XY73, he is introduced as Sawyer.\nHe was later seen attempting to challenge Valerie at the Laverre Gym but he unfortunately arrived on the day she was debuting her Furisode Collection and was told he couldn`t battle her that day. He reunited with Clemont who introduced him to Ash and company.\nWhile waiting for Serena and Bonnie to look at the clothes, Ash challenged Sawyer to a battle and the two decided on a Double Battle. Despite a type advantage, Ash`s battles are unpredictable because he negates type disadvantages like they are nothing and due to this and Sawyer lack of Double Battle experience, Ash easily won the match. He was grateful to battle though and gain the experience.\nAs part of an established custom at Valerie`s cloth collection show debuts, Valerie picks one person to battle with. She chose Sawyer and told him if he defeated her, she would give him a Gym badge. Unfortunately for Sawyer, he was unable to defeat her but was grateful for the experience and vowed to return to defeat her.",
