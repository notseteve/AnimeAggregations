  "description" : "Tony is a young boy that lives with his parents on an island in the Decolora archipelago. While walking near the Pokémon Center, he met Alexa`s Gogoat and he touched its horns. Alexa`s Gogoat is able to sense the strong feelings of those who touch its horns. Sensing that Tony wanted to visit his father, Alexa`s Gogoat motioned for Tony to ride on it so they could go to the mountain observatory where his father worked.\nTony`s Mother was upset because her son Tony was missing. Officer Jenny (Isshu) said there had been reports that a Pokémon uncommon in the area was walking with a boy looking like Tony on its back. Tony`s Mother explained that he might have gone to the observatory as her husband works there and it`s his birthday. She continued by saying Tony was excited to celebrate it with him and even prepared a present but her husband had to stay overnight at the observatory and couldn`t come home. Officer Jenny instructed Tony`s Mother to stay at home in case he returned there.\nThankfully with the help of Ash and his friends, they were able to find Tony and make sure he got to his father despite being told it was a dangerous journey to come visit him on his own.",
