  "description" : "Yuuta`s Kabigon encountered Satoshi and his friends in the forest and bounced Pikachu and Pochama off the trampoline it was training on.\nYuuta unknowingly left his Kabigon in the hands of the Rocket Gang who were posing as masseuses. When Yuuta returned to get Kabigon for the Dash Hurdle (ダッシュハードル) event, Rocket Gang tried to get away but Kabigon was connected to the balloon with a rope and its weight prevented them from escaping. Musashi sent out her Yanamega to cut the rope, but Kabigon used a trampoline from the Bound Field (バウンドフィールド) event to send Rocket Gang flying and free Pikachu.\nIn the Dash Hurdle (ダッシュハードル) event, Yuuta`s Kabigon went up against Satoshi`s Pikachu. It ended up being a photo finish as Kabigon barely won. Yuuta ended up winning the Tsubaki Town Pokethlon and Kabigon was seen on the podium receiving a wreath.",
