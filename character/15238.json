  "description" : "Enshou`s other adviser. While she may seem timid and weak compared to her master, Enshou, and her friend, Bunshuu, she is fact the smartest of the three and is the only one with common sense. Despite being the smartest of the three, she isn`t really that smart as her IQ is about 34 and she is easily offended if anyone calls her IQ any lower than that. She is also very conscious about her figure, and when dressing up, always checks her belly fat (she gets really upset whenever Bunshuu reminds her of this).",
