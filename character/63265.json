  "description" : "Isaac Westcott is a wizard from an alternate timeline. A natural-born psychopath with zero empathy, he kills without compunction and has no conscience. He and two other wizards from their home village, which mostly wiped out himself, jumped timelines to a high-tech one where they sought to create their ideal world. This resulted in the birth of Mio, the Spirit of Origin. He will do anything, murder anyone, in order to achieve his twisted ideals.",
