  "description" : "A former friend and rival of http://anidb.net/ch61 [Kamogawa] and http://anidb.net/ch12790 [Nekota]. In his younger days, Hama boxed along with the two, but never managed to reach their level, partially due to his unusually fragile jaw. Nevertheless, he is a brilliant tactician who, since having left Japan for Mexico, is renowned for his successful training of several champions, including http://anidb.net/ch13223 [Sanada Kazuki]. Hama still harbors deep feelings of rivalry towards http://anidb.net/ch61 [Kamogawa], and strives to one day train a boxer that can defeat http://anidb.net/ch23 [Makunouchi] or http://anidb.net/ch3 [Takamura]. He is currently the trainer of http://anidb.net/ch119 [Alexander Volk Zangiev] in America.",
