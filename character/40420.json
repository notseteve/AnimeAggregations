He invited them back to his cabin where they explained that they found a lost Cubchoo and were trying to reunite it with its family. Cliff was familiar with the terrain and decided he would help them.\nCliff took a liking to Meowth when he realized it could talk and attempted to capture it. Meowth protested after Cliff unsuccessfully tried to capture it by saying he wanted to be an independent Pok√©mon which Cliff quickly acknowledged.\nWith Cliff`s assistance, Ash and his friends were able to track down Cubchoo family.",
