  "description" : "The First High School Student Council is a student governing organization with great powers over the http://anidb.net/ch67045 [First High School] student body and one of the three most important student organizations in First High, alongside the http://anidb.net/ch67047 [Disciplinary Committee] and the http://anidb.net/ch67048 [Extracurricular Activities Federation]. While the student council president is elected by the students, all other student council posts are assigned by the president. Under the school`s policy of allowing the students self-rule, the council has appointment rights for the posts of head of most committees, assigns three of the nine members of the Disciplinary Committee, and overall holds ample leeway for executive decisions concerning the students` school life.",
