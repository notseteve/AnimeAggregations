  "description" : "Sarutoru is one of Prince Toma`s three human-animal hybrid warriors. He appears to be the leader of the three and Toma`s second-in-command, as he is often seen trying to advise his lord, as well as being the only one Toma calls by his name.\nWhen Toma lets his men loose on the captured women, Sarutoru takes Ukyo and tries to woo her until Ryoga busts in. Ukyo tricks Ryoga into fighting Sarutoru, only for Sarutoru to unintendedly supercharge the lost boy`s Lion`s Roar move, which easily beats him.",
