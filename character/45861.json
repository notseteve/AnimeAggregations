  "description" : "While at the Astilbe Town Pokémon Center, Ash`s Tepig noticed Suwama and came up to it. After talking with Ash and his friends, he realized that this was the Tepig he`d let go. Ash wanted to prove to Suwama that Tepig was a strong Pokémon and they decided to have a battle with Ash`s Tepig as the focus. During the battle, Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin him despite the fact that he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.\nGym Battle against Brycen\nAsh`s Pignite was then sent out to battle Brycen`s Cryogonal and like Ash`s Scraggy, it had a hard time attacking and defending against Rapid Spin. The Rapid Spin was strengthened to ward off and mitigate disadvantageous moves and Brycen countermeasures were almost perfect. It wasn`t until Ash realized they could use Fire Pledge at the center of the rotation of Rapid Spin to knock it off. The strategy worked and Brycen`s Cryogonal was knocked out.\nBrycen`s Beartic replaced Brycen`s Cryogonal and Ash`s Pignite quickly found itself being outmatched despite the type advantage. Brycen`s Beartic used Brine and Aerial Ace to quickly knock Ash`s Pignite out.",
