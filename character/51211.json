  "description" : "Kirigiri Kyouko is an enigmatic silver-haired girl whose high school talent is unknown. Though aloof and slow to trust others, she`s adept at noticing things which the other students don`t, which proves vital once bodies start turning up. She often advises Naegi on conducting investigations. Apparently, she`s trying to retrieve something that Monobear stole from her in the past.\nSource: Wikipedia",
