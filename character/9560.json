  "description" : "Kaoru is relatively quiet and reserved, but when he does talk, he tells the truth, if you like it or not. He prefers to go it alone and not to involve anyone else, risking his life for another without hesitation. Like Luna, he holds a death deep in his heart that has changed his life. He`s often resourceful and catches onto something before anyone else. He was the only one - besides Luna - who stood up to Howard at the beginning. It is hinted that Kaoru likes Luna when the former became jealous of Bell \"proposing\" to the latter.",
