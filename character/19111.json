  "description" : "Sakuya is one of Kuuya`s attendants and Genjimaru`s granddaughter. Kuuya offered her once to Hakouro as a concubine, an offer he, embarrassed, declined. Kuuya comically told Hakuoro and Eruru that Sakuya was \"good in bed\". Both Eruru and Hakuoro took this the wrong way, since Kuuya actually meant Sakuya was \"good at making beds\".",
