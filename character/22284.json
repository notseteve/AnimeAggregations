  "description" : "Yunihiko, the Master of the Forest, is a devilish, `unpure` unicorn who enjoys drinking sake and eating fried squid. He is Peganosuke`s twin brother. Mischievous, but never malevolent, he often lies to manipulate Uruno and Usahara for his own amusement. On rare occasions he is seen to have a conscience, but this doesn`t stop him from thoroughly enjoying getting the other animals riled up.\nSource: wiki",
