  "description" : "Tim Marcoh, formerly known as the Crystal Alchemist, was the leading researcher in the military`s Philosopher`s Stone creation project. After sacrificing a number of innocent Ishbalans during the Ishbalan War in order to create new stones, he fled the military with some imperfect stone samples. He settled down in a small country town where he uses his stones to heal the sick.\nHe is later found by the Elric brothers, and he directs them to some of the research he left behind in Central to help them in their search for the Philosopher`s Stone.\nMarcoh is then captured by the homunculi, and is kept locked up deep below Central. While there, he is found by http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar]. Seeing Scar as a means to an end, he tells Scar of his involvement in the Ishbalan War in the hopes of being killed in vengeance. Scar instead disfigures Marcoh`s face beyond recognition as a disguise, kidnaps him, and forces him to help in bringing down the homunculi.\nAfter Father`s defeat, Marcoh offers to restore Mustang`s eyesight in return of allowing the surviving Ishbalans to return to their homeland with him placed there as a doctor.\nIn the first anime, he is soon afterward taken into military custody, only to be killed by the homunculus http://anidb.net/ch5909 [Gluttony].\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
