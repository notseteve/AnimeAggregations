  "description" : "A nun and an inquisitor belonging to the Holy Dynasty. A fundamentalist, she is an extremely strict, yet devoted follower of God who is known for executing heretics, usually by burning them alive. Although many call her a cruel person, she is actually a virtuous woman, but she is too serious and inflexible and does not hesitate in judging people.\nIn the OVA prologue, it is revealed that prior to her title as Inquisitor, she was stationed at the 16th monastery, and was invited by the Holy Dynasty to worship in the Grand Cathedral. During that time, she met Ymir following a skirmish with some drunken women, and has grown acquainted to her despite the latter`s merchant-like personality. It is also shown that she tends to rush with her Holy Poses, often rendering them ineffective.\nSiggy is very eager to bring down the Rebel Army, who she considers to be a band of heretics, and sees their leader Annelotte, who carries demon blood, as an abomination. She also considers the use of alchemy as a heresy (even the Holy Dynasty has divided opinions on this topic). She is armed with the Holy Flame Mace and God`s Chained Blade, and her fighting skills rivals Annelotte`s. Like Melpha in Queen`s Blade, she is also a user of the \"Divine Power\", the manifestation of God`s miracles utilized by the provocative \"Holy Poses\". Later on, she has a crisis of faith, but Annelotte helps her and tells her she doesn`t have to fight alone anymore. She ends up joining the Rebel Army, where she calls Annelotte \"Elder Sister\".\nSource: Wiki",
