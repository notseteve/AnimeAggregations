  "description" : "Hiko Seijuurou XIII is Himura Kenshin`s master in the anime/manga series Rurouni Kenshin.\nHiko is shown to be sarcastic, misanthropic and a punishing taskmaster, often referring to Kenshin as \"My stupid/idiot apprentice,\" and bringing up Kenshin`s past to provoke him into training harder. Kenshin describes his personality as \"crude, cruel, and hateful.\" Despite this rough exterior, he has a deep sense of responsibility to Kenshin and those he protects, in the rare cases when he does get involved in a situation (usually at his own will). He has also been shown to be highly respectful and polite towards those he considers to be a true warrior, while at the same time condescending on those he considers to be weak. He loves sake, himself, and teasing Kenshin, although this is a testament to his excellent skill and powerful body. Master and student frequently have bouts of slapstick conflict between them. He dislikes socialising, and in order to avoid having to work with people, he makes his living as a pottery artist.",
