  "description" : "Masane Amaha`s daughter. She is nicknamed Riko. Although she is Masane`s daughter, she acts like the mother, responsibility-wise. Rihoko does the shopping, cooking, cleaning, and so forth, although she does not mind doing these things at all. Riko cares for her mother deeply and wants to be with Masane. The NSWF`s Child Welfare Division wants to take Rihoko because Masane has no way of taking care of her in the event of illness or emergencies. She is frequently praised for her good cooking capabilities.",
