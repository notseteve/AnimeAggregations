  "description" : "James \"Jim\" Hawking is an 11-year-old business partner and sidekick of Gene Starwind. He is the son of a famous computer hacker known as the \"Computer Wizard.\" How he met Gene is unknown. Jim serves as the team`s computer expert, hacker, strategist, and back-up. He is responsible and concerned; he worries about the team`s finances and plans, prefers to earn money the hard way rather than to take risks, and is often annoyed by Gene`s lazy and cavalier attitude. Jim becomes good friends with fellow Outlaw Star crew member Aisha Clan Clan, who is in some ways his opposite: Jim gets treated like a kid even though he acts like an adult, while Aisha, though an adult, acts like a kid. Jim also looks up to the android Melfina as a mother figure (whom he occasionally has to protect from Gene`s lecherous advances) and gets along well with the Outlaw Star`s on-board computer, Gilliam II. Jim has trouble, however, trusting strangers such as Hilda, who first approaches him and Gene under false pretenses, and Suzuka, who tries to kill Gene and whose motives are unclear. Episode 20 of the anime tells the story of Jim`s first love, a young girl named Hanmyo who, unknown to the crew, is a combat pilot charged with destroying the Outlaw Star and its crew. His name could be a nod to Jim Hawkins of Robert Louis Stevenson`s Treasure Island.\nJim modifies one of the Gilliam maintenance robots, changing its color from blue to pink and adding silly eyebrows. He says that he just felt like making one of them special. After this is done, he carries that one with him and uses it as his own personal link to Gilliam.",
