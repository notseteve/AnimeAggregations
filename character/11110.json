  "description" : "Hideyoshi Kinoshita is a very feminine-looking bishounen and is the younger twin brother of Yuuko Kinoshita of class A. Despite being a fraternal twin, except for his male body, he looks almost identical to his twin sister. Because of that, his male peers, and many of his female peers, see him as a female, which upsets him though he doesn`t express it strongly. In the Anime, his feminine looks are often the subject of fanservice, going so far as to make him his own gender. Hideyoshi has a helpful personality and is willing to support any activity his friends embark on. He uses the term `Washi`, used by old venerable men to describe himself. While he is bad in academics, he has unquestionable talent in acting, and can not only replicate the behavior and mannerisms of other people but also their voices as well. In volume 2, he was instigated by Akihisa to mimic Yuuji`s voice to propose to Shouko during their tournament, confusing her and ultimately setting up the stage for a win for Akihisa-Yuuji Team, but this move caused Yuuji all manner of problems later on. His Shoukanjuu is clad in Hakama and wields a Naginata.",
