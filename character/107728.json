  "description" : "Polteageist is a Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves from Sinistea when exposed to a Cracked Pot or a Chipped Pot. The item required depends on its form.\n- The Phony Form (if it lacks a mark of authenticity) requires a Cracked Pot to evolve.\n- The Antique Form (if it has a mark of authenticity) requires a Chipped Pot to evolve.\nPolteageist is a rotund purple ghost that lives in a teapot. It is made of black tea that tastes very good, but can cause indigestion or stomach aches if drunk in excess. Only its trainer is allowed to drink the tea. They live in hotels and restaurants to infect teapots to create more of their own kind. As such, Polteageist is a genderless species.\nMost of the teapots that Polteageist infects are forgeries, but occasionally an authentic one is found (with a mark of authenticity on the bottom). Polteageist attacks by shooting tea at its enemy`s mouth, causing them strong chills when swallowed.\nPolteageist is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Teatime.",
