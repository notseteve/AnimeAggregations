Casshern was ordered by Braiking Boss to assassinate Luna, however, this act triggered a cataclysmic event and he fell into a deep slumber. Upon waking hundreds of years later, he finds that the world has become a poisonous wasteland, and has no memory of who he was before his coma. When he learns that it was in fact he who caused the ruination which lead to the present Dark Ages, he is stricken with agony. He attempts to elude the many people who want him dead, as repayment for his role in the destruction of the world. He is also unable to distinguish himself as a savior or a destroyer, as his violent impulses often get in the way of his quest for good.",
