  "description" : "Hikari`s mother is a kind and good-natured person who seems to accept Hikari`s activities, whether it is taking care of Kei overnight or suddenly travelling to London, without too much fuss. She frequently welcomes Hikari`s friends to her house, usually without warning on Hikari`s part. However, she does lament that Hikari is unusually strong for a girl (such that she finds it difficult to even see Hikari as a girl at times) and absolutely refuses to allow her daughter to enter the kitchen, well aware of Hikari`s destructive inability to cook.",
