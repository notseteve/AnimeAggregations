  "description" : "The Gogg is Zeon`s first mass-produced amphibious mobile suit. Like the later models in the series, it`s a squat, monstrous machine with thick pressure-resistant armour and multi-segmented arms tipped with sharp claws. The water-cooled reactor housed within the Gogg`s hulking torso is large enough to power a pair of built-in mega particle cannons. However, the Gogg can only operate for short periods out of the water.",
