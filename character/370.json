  "description" : "Cubone`s name is a combination of the words cub and bone, in reference to its young age and relation to bones, both as weapons and armor. The \"Cu-\" may also be derived from cute, as Cubone is rather referred to as cute and lonely, or the derogatory term \"cue ball\", referring to a bald person, which is a reference to the skull it wears. Its Japanese name is most likely a pun on 空 kara (emptiness), 殻 kara (shell), and/or からから karakara (dried-up). In the Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow a Cubone is adopted by Mr. Fuji after its mother is killed by Team Rocket. Cubone is also a playable character in Pokémon Red Rescue Team and Pokémon Blue Rescue Team. The skull a Cubone wears on its head is said to be the skull of its mother, who dies whenever a Cubone is born. Because it never removes its skull helmet, no one has ever seen a Cubone`s actual face. Its cries for its mother are often heard echoing inside the skull.",
