  "description" : "When Simon uses the Gurren Lagan to merge into the Arc-Gurren, he converts the Dai-Gun into a Dai-Gunman called the Arc-Gurren Lagann, powered up by one of the Gurren Lagann`s Giga Drills similar to how the Lagann is powered by Simon`s Core Drill. The power of this Gunmen isn`t fully displayed in the series, but it has the ability to rip the fabric of space-time itself through its sheer brute force on its debut. The Arc-Gurren Lagann is usually used exclusively by Simon and Viral, in the Gurren-Lagann. It can form massive drills or fight with punches.",
