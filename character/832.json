  "description" : "Donphan is an armored elephant-like Pok√©mon that can easily take normal attacks without receiving a scratch. Its large, sharp tusks that take long to grow serve as a status symbol in their herds. It is very strong; as it is able to easily haul dump trucks and demolish houses by tackling them. This strength is often used to clear rock and mud slides that block trails. Its favorite attack is the \"Rollout\", where it curls into a ball and charges at high speeds, though it is hard for it to stop.\nIts stats in the video games are reasonably good; its attack and defense have a base stat of 120. It can learn Fire Fang, Thunder Fang, Ice Shard, Earthquake, and Rock Polish among other useful attacks.",
