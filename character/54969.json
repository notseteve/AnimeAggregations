  "description" : "Indigo colored Unit-6. Believed to be used as a support unit, it has an air of mystery about it. Its weapon, Humming Bird, which appears as a mix between a staff and a hammer, has a special ability to hack into any system by tapping it to the target, which happens if the target then lets out a green circle, if not then the hacking failed. It is equipped with the Fan Talons for close combat. It is also studded with multiple Sense Nerves called Shinrabansho, which provide sensor functions for all humanoid weapons.\nSource: Wiki",
