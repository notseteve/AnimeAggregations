  "description" : "The minister of the Magdalene Order. He also serves as a field agent and second in command to Sister Kate. In the Anime, towards the end he leaves the Order. He is seen quite a while later, looking about the same age but unshaven, when the third Prophecy of Fatima happens, just before, seeing someone who appears similar, if not the same, to Aion. He also has the apparent ability to warp, moving from the Magdalene NY HQ to a carnival in San Francisco instantly without anyone`s notice. Immediately afterward, during the phone conversation with Sister Kate, he states that he is an Angel. He later states \"I am a Sinner\", after he severs ties with God, declaring \"I have no regrets about my torn wings\".\n(Wikipedia)",
