  "description" : "Moé-chan is an automaton with broken legs, built more than 100 years ago and bought by Tokyo Imperial University while she was on display at the Paris World`s Fair in 1900. Urashima Keisuke purchased her from the university in hopes of repairing her.\nMoé-chan was a great friend of Keisuke, Granny Hina`s father and great-grandfather to Keitaro and Haruka. Keisuke had promised to fix Moé-chan`s legs; but like Keitaro, Keisuke had a poor memory and eventually forgot about Moé-chan. Keitaro would later make the same promise to fix her. With the help of the Hinata residents, particularly Kaolla`s help, he ultimately fulfilled his promise and Moé-chan was able to walk again.",
