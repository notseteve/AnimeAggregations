  "description" : "This medium scale warship, often found in the role of a fleet command ship, is actually two individual vessels able to be separated to serve different functions. The forward section of the Queadol Magdomilla (the Assault Module) can detach from the main vessel (the Orbital Module) and act as an aerial assault craft for combat inside a planetary atmosphere. The modular system allows the two sections to operate independently and both are heavily armed with hangar bays carrying large mecha complements. While the orbital module can still enter a planetary atmosphere like most Zentradi warships, the ship has limited maneuverability. Although this class has been in use for hundreds of millennia, as has most of the Zentradi fleet, the Queadol Magdomilla was born in the middle stages of the Galactic Empire`s Schism War and is thus one of the newer ships of line.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin Kravshera] used a Queadol Magdomilla as flagship for his 109th Branch Fleet`s 7th Aerial Armoured Division of the Bodol Main Fleet. During Space War I, http://anidb.net/ch10516 [Quamzin] once made use of the Assault Module of his Queadol Magdomilla to launch a suicide run against the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. Female Zentradi commander http://anidb.net/ch10537 [Moruk Lap Lamiz] also utilized a Queadol Magdomilla in alternate fleet colors as her own command ship. Laden with many weapons, mecha and the capability to operate both in space and an atmosphere makes the Queadol Magdomilla a potent and versatile warship.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/queadol-magdomilla.htm",
