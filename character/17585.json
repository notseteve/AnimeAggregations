  "description" : "Hatake Sakumo, also known as Konoha`s White Fang, is the father of http://anidb.net/ch7248 [Hatake Kakashi].\nSakumo was a famous and powerful ninja of Konohagakure who, during his life, was greater than even the Sannin. His son, Kakashi, idolized him and sought to become just as great a ninja as his father; his wife had died when Kakashi was very young. Sometime in a war, Sakumo also killed http://anidb.net/ch7741 [Sasori]`s parents, earning http://anidb.net/ch9650 [Chiyo]`s hatred. Five years before the events of the Kakashi Gaiden, Sakumo and his team were sent on a mission of great importance to Konoha. When his teammates` lives were endangered, Sakumo chose to abandon the mission in order to save them. He was disgraced when he returned home, shunned by everyone in the village, even those he had saved. Dishonored, Sakumo fell into a deep depression, as well as a drop in his skills. Eventually, he committed suicide, which caused Kakashi to live strictly according to the Ninja Code during the time before his last mission with http://anidb.net/ch10928 [Uchiha Obito].\nTaken from Narutopedia",
