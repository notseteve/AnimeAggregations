  "description" : "The primary wide receiver of the Deimon Devil Bats. Although he is short in stature, he has remarkable skill in catching. He is observant, recognizing Sena as Eyeshield 21 the first time he saw Eyeshield 21 in person during a practice. Monta was originally a member of the baseball team, where he was an effective fielder due to his intense focus on catching. However, he was cursed with terrible throwing abilities (to almost impossible degrees, sometimes), making him fail to be on even the backup lineup for the club. When the baseball team explained that they needed balanced players, Monta is approached by Sena and decides to pursue his dream of becoming a master catcher as a football player instead. He is best known for always going into a pose after a catch while yelling \"CATCH MAX!\" He also adds \"Max\" to nearly anything he describes while excited or determined. His nickname is Monta, which was initially a mistake by Sena, but later accepted when Hiruma tells Taro that the name \"Monta\" is a play on the name Joe Montana (though Hiruma later admits that was just a fib). He is Hiruma`s primary receiving target on the field, and one of Sena`s closest friends on the team. During the second game against Oujou, Raimon discovered his own special ability, the Devil Back-Fire, which his ability to predict Hiruma`s passes due to trajectory and wind interference. This gives him the ability to rush forward at his target, keeping his attention focused and prepared for any tricks, then catch passes from behind him. As a former baseball player, he also has a talent for catching with one hand when necessary.",
