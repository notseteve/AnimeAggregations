  "description" : "The protagonist of the story. He is a fifteen year old member of the Red Lynx sky pirates who is not allowed to come on raids because he is slow and has difficulty flying a plane. He aspires to become the new captain of the pirates, and continue to become one of the greatest known Sky Pirates. Coud was homeless until the age of five when he was found by the boss of the Red Lynx who he since looked up to like father. He takes what boss tells him seriously which is why he feels protecting Ren is so important. Since the Red Lynx sky pirates is a male only ship, Coud never had the chance to interact with females until he met Ren. As a result, he is very shy around her especially when he and Ren are alone together.",
