  "description" : "Saori, nicknamed Saorin, is a girl who is a fifth grader in http://anidb.net/ch21554 [Shuuichi`s] class at the beginning of Wandering Son. She takes an interest in encouraging Shuuichi to cross-dress, even going so far as to buy him an expensive dress for his birthday, which he later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuuichi. She tends to convey what is on her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuuichi, because of his femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuuichi, because of her feelings for him. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.",
