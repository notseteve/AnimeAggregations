  "description" : "The A-Laws (Autonomous Peace-Keeping Force) are an independent secret police of Earth Sphere Federation, having splintered off the main army, answering only to the government. Their mission is to further unify nations. But their ideals and tactics are a facade of oppression, causing destruction to any nation that doesn`t submit to the ESF. This information has been kept secret from the public but a number of resistance fighters calling themselves Kataron have vowed to stop them. Their actions trigger the return of Celestial Being to activity, four years after their last battle. This premise is parallel to the AEUG/Titans conflict in Zeta Gundam.\nGranted special powers by the Federation government, the A-Laws have near total authority over all of the Federation`s operations. This enables them to reprimand senior regular army officers, regardless of rank. Also, there are officers who are licensed, who can do whatever they please.",
