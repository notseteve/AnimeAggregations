  "description" : "Futaba`s younger sister. She shows a deep amount of respect for Futaba, referring to her as onee-sama. Wakaba is almost always seen carrying around her potted cactus, whom she named Togemura (literally translated as \"thorn village\"). Like some devoted plant lovers, Wakaba talks to Togemura as if it was a person; what is unusual is that Togemura appears to be able to communicate with Wakaba as well. Wakaba also uses Togemura as a fortune-telling device and as a weapon to defend herself and her friends, magical girl-style.",
