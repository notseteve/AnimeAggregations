  "description" : "Good Morning is a relatively common type of monster seen in low-level dungeons. Their appearance resembles a brain-like meat-ball with tentacles and a few masks attached to it as his \"faces\".\nContrary to what one would expect from a Monster, Good Morning is a very polite creature, often greeting everyone he encounters with a cortious salute.\nSource: AliceSoftwiki",
