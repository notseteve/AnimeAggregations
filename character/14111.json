  "description" : "Since childhood Sara Nome has been groomed to become Mayan Island`s priestess/shaman, a position of great spiritual importance to the people of the secluded island. It also means having the \"mystical power\" of interacting with the island`s mysterious alien ruins, a little-understood ability that she manifests through singing an ancient Mayan chant. She also gets occasional visions into the future. This power seems to run through her family`s blood as her little sister Mao also displays the same abilities to a lesser degree.",
