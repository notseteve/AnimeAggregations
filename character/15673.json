  "description" : "After the collapse of the E.U. and the revolt in the Chinese Federation, most of the territories not under the control of the Britannian Empire formed a loose coalition of states to contain Britannian expansion, known as the United Federation of Nations (UFN).\nThe UFN is composed of forty-seven countries spread across parts of Central and Eastern Europe, Eastern Africa, and the majority of the Asian continent. Decisions are decided by a two-thirds majority vote by the leaders of each country, voting percentage being proportional to population. Member nations have no national armies: all armed forces they may have had are subsumed under the Black Knights, which became the military arm of the Federation.",
