  "description" : "Tikal is the daughter of Chief Pachacamac from the same tribe that Knuckles the Echidna descends. She first appears in Sonic Adventure and returns in Sonic Adventure 2 as a bonus character. Thousands of years before the main events of the series, she opposes her father`s power-hungry ways of invading other countries. She eventually comes into contact with Chaos and a group of Chao at the shrine of the Master Emerald, who accept her due to her friendliness to them. She tries to change her father`s mind about raiding the shrine for the emeralds, but he refuses to listen. After Pachacamac raids the shrine, angering Chaos, Tikal recites a poem taught to her by her grandmother and figures out how to use the Master Emerald`s power. She then seals herself and Chaos into the emerald. Several thousand years later, Doctor Eggman shatters the Master Emeralds and awakens the angry Chaos and Tikal`s spirit. Tikal helps the main characters defeat Chaos, and then leaves with Chaos.",
