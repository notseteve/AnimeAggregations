  "description" : "Mei Li Naceri (means \"born from the pure verdant Fars tree\" in Elven) is an Elfin ace pilot in http://anidb.net/ch101609 [SSFs 101 squadron] and Iris` partner, whom she is on par with.\nThe race of elves are proud and long-living (Mei Li herself having lived over a century) and highly intelligent.\nOn personal level, despite being proud of her heritage, she is fascinated by the Human culture of her partner.\nAs a coping mechanism during her enslavement, she develops an alter-ego, \"Riruru\". The ordeal prevents her from remembering her past, thus she is unable to recognize her partner Iris, who notes that Riruru wears several traits of Mei Li, with the most noteworthy difference being the addition of lewdness. Riruru herself grows curious about the character of Mei Li.",
