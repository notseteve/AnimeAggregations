After Jamian was killed, Dante revealed himself with Algol and Capella to Phoenix Ikki, who had defeated Jamian. After Capella was knocked out by Ikki, Dante charged, only to have his chained steel balls destroyed by the Bronze Saint. The Phoenix Saint knocked Dante unconscious as well, to deal with Capella. Meanwhile, the other Bronze Saints arrived. Dante was furious due to his disgrace and went after Ikki, but was stopped by Andromeda Shun. During their fight, Shun said to Dante: \"Your chains were merely designed to hold the hound of Hades,\" and added that they were like tinsel compared to his own Nebula Chains, which Shun used to defeat the Cerberus Saint.\nSource: Wikipedia",
