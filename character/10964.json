  "description" : "It is the dog of Akane, and her secret lover. It is a strange dog, full of initiatives to be seen from his beloved owner and walk like a normal person. It has the ability to speak, but only Kappei understands. But the dog has also another function: he explains some of the basic basket. Although he and Kappei continually falling out of love for Akane (moments when Solomon loses because, as Gigi reminded him, he is a dog while Akane is a human being), Seiichiro is his best friend.",
