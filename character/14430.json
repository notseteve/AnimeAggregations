  "description" : "Ruru, being the youngest of the group, is a rather spoiled girl. Her hairstyle and pigtail holders represent a frog`s skin and eyes. Ruru died of being too cold, so she is afraid of cold things. Her spoiled behavior has earned her the ire of Gou and Gai whenever she does something that contradicts their activities (in Gou`s case, she insisted Gorou read her a story when he hadn`t eaten breakfast and in Gai`s, she changed the channel while he was watching an anime). To this she replies that she only obeys Gorou, causing them to break into fits, which prompts at least Shin to restrain them. Ruru is in the Junior rank. Her name means pearl. Her color image is yellow-green.",
