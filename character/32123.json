  "description" : "Toori`s older sister. Both she and Toori were born on the same year, so they are of the same grade level. Bad with ghosts. Is a follower in the god of eroticism and dance. Dislikes her name, \"Kimi\" for some reason, so she changes it habitually. Though she calls Toori a foolish little brother, she also has another side that cares for him.\nShe was the person who tried to take Toori back to normal life after Horizon`s Death. Its said that she only cried for Toori and so she never complains about any other pain, since she believes they are not comparable to that time earlier.\nSource: kyoukaisen.tumblr.com",
