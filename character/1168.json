  "description" : "Okita is the best swordsman in the Shinsengumi. Personality-wise, he tends to be light-hearted and somewhat childish, not entirely unlike Kagura, though his speech is heavily deadpan. The rest of his character can be inferred from the following conversation between Kondou and Hijikata: Kondou asks Hijikata to stop Okita \"before he becomes a sadist\", Hijikata responds with \"No, it`s too late. He`s the King of the Planet of Sadists\".",
