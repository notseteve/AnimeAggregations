  "description" : "Lum`s infant cousin. He is often called \"Ten-chan\" by Lum and many of the other main female characters, the male characters often call him by his full-name \"Jariten\" (\"Jari\" means something like \"brat\" in Japanese). He comes to earth after flying in a spaceship inside a peach (a reference to the Japanese folktale of Momotaro) to live with Lum in the Moroboshi household when his Oni powers first manifest. He appeared much earlier in the anime (making his debut in Episode Two) than in the Manga. Ten has a single horn on his head, can breathe fire, flies very slowly, and wears tiger striped diaper. He and Ataru utterly loathe each other and often fight. Ten`s character design and relationship to the series` male lead is somewhat similar to that of Shippo from Inuyasha (though there is much more acrimony between Ten and Ataru than between Shippo and Inuyasha).\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
