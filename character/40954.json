  "description" : "Like J.D., he is also an artifact made by the Foundation in a desperate attempt to make another Artifact like J.D., after they \"lost\" him during the mysterious fire. The fact that Jet and J.D. are both artifacts makes them \"brothers\".\nIn season 2, he takes order from Mathias. However, Mathias abandons him as he failed to complete his mission to capture Angelique, the Queen`s Egg. Mathias tells him to \"go wherever he wants\". Without a master and orders to follow, he was lost and attempted to carry out the last order he had been given (to capture Angelique), when he came across Angelique and her friends. He and J.D. began to fight, but he left after he saw that it was upsetting Angelique.\nHe then showed up where they were repairing the Ship of Stars and tells Erenfried to deactivate him because he was beginning to have feelings (primarily around Angelique) and he considered himself \"defective\". Erenfried refused because it meant that Jet was developing a heart and told him to act according to his own will from now on. Therefore he helps out in the repairs of the Ship Of Stars, but in the morning of the departure, he sacrificed his life to remove the bomb that Erebos planted in the ship.\nHowever, he seems to have been saved by Erenfried in the last episode of season 2 (he is seen at the very end in a capsule being taken care of).\nSource: Wiki",
