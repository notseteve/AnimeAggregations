  "description" : "Kadaj is the main antagonist throughout most of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The leader of the Remnants of Sephiroth, Kadaj`s goal is to find Jenova, who he believes is his Mother, and conquer the planet. However, unknown to him is the influence of Sephiroth over Jenova`s remains, and so Kadaj is unaware that he is merely a tool for Sephiroth`s resurrection, although he knows that Sephiroth is more favoured by Jenova.\nKadaj, above his brothers, is aware of the existence and plans of Jenova and Sephiroth, as neither Loz or Yazoo even indicate they know Sephiroth exists. In spite of, or perhaps because of this, Kadaj`s dedication to his Mother`s cause is accompanied by a deep insecurity over his inferiority to Sephiroth in her eyes. Despite this, he is still a highly skilled warrior and a strong leader.",
