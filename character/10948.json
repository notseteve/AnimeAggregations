  "description" : "Degwin is the patriarch of the Zabi family which rules the Principality of Zeon. Ten years ago, the revolutionary leader Zeon Zum Deikun - the man who led the space colonies of Side 3 to independence - expired under suspicious circumstances, leaving Degwin as his apparent successor. Degwin then established the Principality and led it to war against the Earth Federation. But now, after a year of conflict, the old tyrant has grown weary of the fighting, and his ambitious son Gihren has usurped much of Degwin`s power.",
