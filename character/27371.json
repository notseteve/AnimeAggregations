It evolves from Boldore when traded, and is the final form of Roggenrolla. It compresses energy in the core inside its body in order to attack with enough power to blow away mountains. It absorbs sunlight with its orange-colored crystal and shoots energy from its mouth.\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava praised it, stating \"Gigalith is exactly what you would want out of a Pokémon\".",
