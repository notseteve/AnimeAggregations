  "description" : "Hajiki`s boss and sort of his stand-in father figure. Manager of Hachisuka Express, his motto is \"we`ll deliver anything\", and by we, he means Hajiki, on a moped, at all hours, to wherever, as long as he gets paid.\nHachisuka isn`t a bad guy, but he has a weird sense of morals. Most of the time, his policy is don`t ask, don`t tell. Slimeball money is as green as anybody else`s and can be spent accordingly.\nHe does nag Hajiki about going to school every now and again though, but he doesn`t push it. He argues constantly with Catherine and can`t seem to stand her, less when she`s being nice to him. He smokes too much, lectures every once in a while, and will usually be there to bring Hajiki back down to earth and out of the I`m-a-hero clouds.\nHe has some connection to Catherine from the past, but not much is said on the subject.\nSource: Wiki",
