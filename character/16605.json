  "description" : "Volcan is one of the trolls, appears a human brat, who frequently calls himself the \"Masmaturian Bulldog\". Volkan always comes up with their plans (which usually turn out to be poorly thought out, utterly bad ideas, and almost never work). He hates Orphen (whom he refers to as \"the black wizard\") and his companions, and always finds a way to ruin whatever they had in mind. It is his fault that Orphen often must use his magic on them to make them go away (himself and Dortin). Volkan wants only power and money. Any scheme he has in mind has the end result of getting him one of the two. None of his schemes ever work, however. He bosses Dortin around a lot, but in a very comical way (and probably means no real harm by it).\nSource: Wikipedia",
