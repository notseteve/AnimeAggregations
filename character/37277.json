  "description" : "Matou Zouken is the head of the Matou family and a specialist in worm and insect magecraft. He was originally known as Makiri Zolgen, but he first changed his name to Zouken, and eventually also his family name to Matou. He is quite ancient, being actually some centuries old, having much prolonged his lifespan by means similar to those of vampirism. His goal is to obtain eternal life, and, under his direction, the Matou family fights for the Holy Grail with that objective in mind.",
