  "description" : "Zapdos is one of the three Legendary Birds along with Articuno and Moltres. It may be based on the thunderbird. It is a bird with a yellow, angular body and wings. Also behind its main yellow wings is a second pair of thinner, jet-black wings. Its beak is long and extremely sharp. Zapdos, a creature that can freely manipulate electricity, is thought to live in thunderclouds, where it apparently only gains power when struck by lightning. It is seen emerging from clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, and even if it does not launch electricity its wings make peculiar crackling and snapping sounds as it flies.\nIt is interesting to note that the last letters of its name, \"dos\" (\"two\" in Spanish), suggest it is the second of the three legendary bird Pokémon. This is reinforced by the fact that the last letters of the names of its fellow legendary birds suggest that they are the first and third. They are Articuno (\"uno\", which is \"one\" in Spanish) and Moltres (\"tres\", which is \"three\" in Spanish).\nZapdos is found in a Power Plant off the coast of the Rock Tunnel near Cerulean City in Pokémon Red and Blue, and related games. It also plays small roles in the anime and manga. Zapdos is featured in Pokémon The Movie 2000 together with the other two Legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres. It appears that Zapdos communicates through electricity as it shocks Pikachu to communicate. Zapdos also appeared in the 9th Pokémon Movie.",
