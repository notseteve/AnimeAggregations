  "description" : "Fujioka is http://anidb.net/ch1159 [Kana]`s classmate. He plays soccer and is a popular classmate of Kana. He is in love with Kana, but http://anidb.net/ch1160 [Chiaki] reads his love letters as letters of challenge, and Kana believes it and nicknames him Banchou (番長), meaning a leader of juvenile delinquents. Although it was only a nickname given to him by Kana during that time, he officially took the name when http://anidb.net/ch3104 [Yuu] didn`t want the nickname and she deliberately loses a rock-paper-scissor game with Fujioka in order to get rid of it, which makes Fujioka the fourth generation Banchou. He is a bit naive and very innocent towards girls. His affection towards Kana will often make him do regrettable things. He is the only person who does not know that http://anidb.net/ch3092 [Touma] is actually a girl.",
