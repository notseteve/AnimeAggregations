  "description" : "Reina`s brother. Master of Suuzan Senpuu Kyaku \"Songshan Whirlwind Kick\". He and his sister left the Land of Asura to join Raou`s army and become his loyal followers. He lost his right leg at Cassandra and wears a prosthetic. After he was struck with a fatal attack by Gaiya which gave him a mere two months to live, he came up with a ruse to scare Raou`s men out of any inclinations of desertion or rebellion. He made it look as if he had allowed an assassin into Raou`s palace and Raou subsequently killed him in front of his horrified troops.",
