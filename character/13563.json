  "description" : "Shirafuji Kyouko is the restaurant manager of Wagnaria. She is almost never seen doing any useful work, except to call on some mysterious people to shake down ruffians who foolishly attempt to leave the restaurant without paying. She is a childhood friend of Todoroki, whom she once saved from bullying, but that seems to have mutated into a strange obsession, but Kyouko seems as oblivious to this as with almost everything else, content to receive Todoroki`s service as it is given.",
