  "description" : "Gligar is a purple scorpion that is able to glide from a leathery membrane it has that functions as wings. Gligar makes its home on steep cliffs. When it spots prey, it lets go of the cliff`s face, spreads its wings and glides silently and effortlessly towards its target, as if it were sliding. This catches its victim by surprise when it flies straight to its face. It then uses its claws and pincers to secure its hold on the opponent`s face and injects it with poison from its tail barb to paralyze the prey. It is the first Flying-type Pokémon that is unaffected by Electric-type attacks. Ash Ketchum caught this Pokémon.",
