  "description" : "Gundam Kyrios` successor unit. Similar to the Kyrios, it has the ability to transform in between mobile suit form and an aircraft form for high speed combat. This is the replacement mobile suit for Allelujah Haptism.\nJust like its predecessor, it carries a twin beam rifle as it`s primary weapon and a pair of beam sabers for melee combat. Arios` forearms contains sub-machine guns for rapid fire to spray a hail of beam fire against enemy units and can attack at greater speeds. It carries two GN Beam Shield emitters on its shoulders that can generate a protective GN field, thus a physical hand-held shield was not made. Its weakness lies with the pilot of Arios, Allelujah is no longer the super solider he used to be. The unit is unable to reach it`s full combat potential because of it.\nArios was later fitted with a new beam rifle and missile launcher pack to increase combat potential and survivability against superior numbers of the Federation`s GNXs. Arios can now vaporize enemy MS units with a single shot and manage more enemy units with missiles that can destroy or divert off enemy combatants.",
