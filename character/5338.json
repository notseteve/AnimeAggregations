  "description" : "The hot-blooded son of Babalun, Chiaia`s childhood friend, and a student of Holy Land Academy. He manipulated Kenshi into assassinating Lashara in episode 1, and is also responsible for recruiting some of the Academy`s students for the invasion of the Holy Land. His Seikijin is blue and gold with a sword that can fire energy blasts from the tip and hilt and a shield as its weapons. He becomes traumatized after witnessing the berserker state of Kenshi`s Seikijin and seeing one of his own comrades fall in the process in episode 11, but eventually recovers in the episode following it. At the end, he finally acknowledges Kenshi`s skill after he loses to him in a duel.\nSource: Wiki",
