  "description" : "The Garmisch Fortress was an Imperial fortress. It was used by http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League] forces as the headquarters of Marquis http://anidb.net/ch303 [Littenheim] and his fleet of 50,000 ships. It was captured by forces under High Admiral http://anidb.net/ch187 [Kircheis] during the Imperial Civil War.\nGarmisch Fortress was a collection of 5 spheres in a row of 3 and a row of 2, with cylindrical connections linking each sphere to adjacent spheres. There was no indication of a main gun on the same scale as the Vulture`s Claw and the Thor Hammer of the http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersburg] and http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn] fortresses respectively. The main fortress command centre was in one of the spheres in the row of 2. The command center`s internal layout was very similar to that of Iserlohn Fortress.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
