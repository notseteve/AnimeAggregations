  "description" : "Buizel is a sea weasel Pok√©mon that uses a flotation sac that acts as an inflatable collar in order to float on the top of the water. When it dives, its sac deflates and it uses its forked tail to swim by rotating it like a screw. Males have two spots on their back, while females only have one.\nIn the anime, Dawn captures a renegade Buizel in the episode \"Buizel Your Way Out of This.\" She later trades him to Ash for his Aipom. Later on in the the series Buizel is involved in an epic battle with a Lucario between Ash and Maylene at the Veilstone Gym and also learns the attack move Water Pulse.",
