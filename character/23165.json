  "description" : "The Zamza-Zah is part of a new series of mobile armors developed for the Earth Alliance by Adukurf Mechano-Industries. This huge machine is operated by a three-person crew made up of a commander, a pilot, and a gunner. Armed with powerful guns and a set of claws that inflict damage via high-frequency vibration, the Zamza-Zah can perform attacks in any direction and at all ranges, and the positron reflector on its upper surface generates a protective barrier that can deflect even the Minerva`s Tannhauser cannon. The Earth Alliance deploys one of these machines to attack the Minerva during its escape from the Orb Union.",
