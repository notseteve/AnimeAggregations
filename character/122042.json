  "description" : "Kyurem is the strongest Dragon type Pokémon in the world. It was born at the same time as Zekrom and Reshiram. It possesses the strongest genes and its body is constantly emitting a bitter chill. Kyurem lives in an abandoned mine up over the mountains near Roshan. It`s said to have never been seen leaving there until it chased after Keldeo. Kyurem is able to speak to humans.\nKeldeo went to challenge Kyurem on its own despite not being able to use its sword yet and against the council of the Sacred Swordsman. During the battle against Kyruem, Keldeo learned that it was still too weak to face Kyurem and it got its horn broken off and it fled because it was scared. Virizion, Terrakion and Cobalion came to rescue Keldeo but they were frozen in ice by Kyurem.\nAfter falling on the train that Ash Ketchum and his friends were traveling on, it befriended them and with their encouragement, Keldeo decided to face Kyurem once more. During that battle, Keldeo learned to use its sword properly and was able to prove to Kyurem that it was a strong Pokémon after all. Kyurem complemented Keldeo on a nice sword and putting the safety of its friends first before accepting that it won the battle against Keldeo. After Keldeo proved to be worthy to become a Sacred Swordsman, Virizion, Terrakion and Cobalion had no objections and agreed that Keldeo should join them.",
