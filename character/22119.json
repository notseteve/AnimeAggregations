  "description" : "Orga Sabnak is effectively the leader of the three biological CPUs. He uses tactics that are reckless and aggressive, causing him to often nearly hit his teammates while piloting his mobile suit, the GAT-X131 Calamity. He usually spends his time between missions reading paperback novels.[4] He is also the only member of the team to seem to care about the welfare of the other two; when Shani is killed, he screams out his teammate`s name, and tries to attack Yzak, his killer.\nUnlike Clotho and Shani, who were killed by Yzak Joule, Orga was killed during the Second Battle of Jachin Due by Three Ships Alliance pilot Athrun Zala in the ZGMF-X09A Justice equipped with the METEOR. Athrun slices Orga in half from behind as he is dodging a beam from Kira.\nFrom flashback sequences in Gundam SEED Destiny, Shinn Asuka`s family is killed by an explosion resulting from a crossfire between Orga`s GAT-X131 Calamity, and the ZGMF-X10A Freedom. It is never made clear which mobile suit, if not both of them, is the direct cause of their deaths.",
