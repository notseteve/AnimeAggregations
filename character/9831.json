  "description" : "Kokoru (spelled \"Cocoloo\" in the subtitles of the ADV Films release) is a soft-spoken young woman who becomes Yuushi`s friend very early in the series. She is a fellow student at the Princess Academy (later revealed to be the Princess of the Spirit World), who wears tiny spectacles at the end of her nose, with her chief characteristics being self-effacing and gentle.\nKokoru is so gentle that she is often ignored and talked-over by the much louder Yuushi and Gurenda, which causes Kokoru to lament that she \"has no presence after all\" (Which is rather ironic, as Kokoru is the princess of the Spirit World).\nHowever, Kokoru is amazingly kind and encouraging towards her friends, which makes an impression on everyone who gets to know her. She, too, suffers from a curse that makes her look ten, even though she is seventeen.",
