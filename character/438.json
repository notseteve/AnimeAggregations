  "description" : "Jynx is a humanoid Pokémon. Jynx walks in a dance-like fashion, wiggling its hips in a seductive manner. Its bouncing motions are alluring enough so that any person seeing it feels compelled to copy the motion. Jynx is known for its smooching habit, which it actually uses as a battling tool. A Jynx usually gives a sleep or confusion-inducing kiss to its opponents, using its signature attack, \"Lovely Kiss.\" Jynx vocalizes a mysterious language, similar to that of humans, understood only by other Jynx, and no human or other Pokémon is able to understand it.\nIn 2000, children`s book author Carole Boston Weatherford published an article complaining that Jynx`s original design bore a striking resemblance to blackface actors, an image from America`s past that is now considered racist. An episode of Pokemon portrayed this, The Ice Cave. She has described the Pokémon as \"a dead ringer for an obese drag queen,\" In response to this controversy, in 2000 Nintendo changed Jynx`s face from black to purple and its hands from blue to purple in localized versions, a change which would be reflected several years later in the Japanese versions of the games and the Advanced Generation anime series. The newly-redesigned Jynx has white arms instead of red arms.",
