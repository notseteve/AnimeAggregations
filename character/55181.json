He is among the first Chimera Ants to be born by the Queen following her change to an all-human diet, later revealed to be a reincarnation of her first human victim Kurt who died attempting to protect his younger sister Reina from Chimera Ants. Colt projects a loyal and formal attitude, being one of the few squad leaders who always gives all the humans they kill to the Queen as food.\nSource: Wikipedia",
