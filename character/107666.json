Pikachu managed to put a swarm of Beedrill in its Electroweb but this Beedrill managed to avoid it and ended up being the one that Go captured.\nBeedrill resides at a habitat at the Sakuragi Institute in Vermilion City. It is not the evolved form of Go`s Weedle or Go`s Kakuna as they are separate Pokémon.",
