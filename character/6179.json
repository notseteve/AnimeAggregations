  "description" : "One of the four Holy Ones and the High Priestess of the Sakigami shrine. Originally believed to have been cursed by the demon Byakuroku, it was later revealed that her spirit was in fact placed within Byakuroku`s body, as an attempt by Bonten to preserve them both (after a battle that would have cost both their lives). Ginshu is actually asexual, but is referred to as a Princess anyway.\nIt is revealed that Ginshu is actually not the real High Priestess, but a decoy to protect the real High Priestess, Shinshu. She possesses \"poison blood\" to demons, so when they try to eat her they die.",
