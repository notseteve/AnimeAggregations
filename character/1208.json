  "description" : "Ambipom is the evolved form of Aipom. Ambipom`s name comes from ambi, which means two (such as ambidextrous), and Aipom. It appears with two tails, which have fingers tipped in red, and two long hairs at the top of its head. These hairs are longer on the female than the male. Ambipom`s feet - which were the same color as its stomach when an Aipom - are now purple. Its arms are stated to be used significantly less than if it were still an Aipom; the two tails perform the arms` duties with better efficiency.\nIt is used by the gym leader Volkner, although it is not an electric type pokemon. Dawn also owns an Ambipom, which she evolved after she traded her Buizel for Ash`s Aipom.",
