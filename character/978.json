  "description" : "Plusle is a very friendly and social Pok√©mon. In battle, it encourages and rallies its partner on in a manner similar to a cheerleader. It flashes and crackles with electric sparks all over its body and can short out the electricity coming out of its paws to create an electric version of a pompom. If its friend loses besides its support, it begins to cry loudly. Plusle tends to absorb electricity by climbing up telephone poles. Plusle is pink with a plus sign for a tail, while Minun is blue, with a minus sign for a tail.",
