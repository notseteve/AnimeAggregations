  "description" : "Another one of the few Dragoons who barely survived the Genesis Wars, due to the Peacemakers` betrayal. She is barely alive, and is unable to assume her true form of a Dragoon. She first appeared as a giant frog with numerous cracks on her body (using frog DNA to give herself physical form). She chased a terrified Pacifica around the lake until Zefiris dispersed her physical form, revealing a semi-transparent girl that was her humanoid form. After Pacifica followed Zefiris` request to tell Gloria to rest, Gloria thanked her and disappeared for good.",
