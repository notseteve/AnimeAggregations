  "description" : "Mori Ai is one of Ueki`s classmates at Hinokuni Junior High School. When in a casual mood, Ai is usually upbeat and friendly, although she is often shown with a very shallow side, initially believing that all power-users (with the exception of Ueki) are dangerous enemies that can`t be trusted. Still, Ai cares deeply for her friends, especially Ueki. She discovers Ueki`s power early on, coming to a rather unusual conclusion and at first believing him to be an alien. Upon learning of the competition Ueki is in, she decides to back him up, to keep him from losing all his talents and disappearing because of it.\nShe is strict with Ueki at times, especially when he looks like he is about to do something rash. Ai continuously tries to be his voice of reason, although her shallow antics and outspoken personality often annoys him. Later on in the series, she is given an ability by the King of the Celestial World Candidate, Wanko, during Ueki`s fight with Sano. However, her power`s condition is that her opponent must perform a goody-two-shoes pose (raising the right leg backwards while putting both of the fists close to the mouth region). Once this power is activated, her opponent falls totally in love with Ai`s glasses and will do anything to keep them from harm, even defeat themselves. Also, they will not attack because they may accidentally break the glasses, and will do anything to prevent Ai breaking them.\nThe food she cooks tends to look rather odd and off-putting (usually with squirming octopus tentacles), but it still tastes good.\nTaken from wikipedia",
