  "description" : "Go wanted to catch as many Pokémon as he could and one day while in a forest in the Kanto region, he caught every Bug type Pokémon native to Kanto. It was a hard Pokémon to catch as its claws and aggressive nature proved to be difficult. Pinsir resides at a habitat at the Sakuragi Institute in Vermilion City.\nGoh`s Heracross is one of 6 Heracross that Kricketina Kylie caught in the Sinnoh region. It tried to help her find a Pinsir but it ended up having to battle against Team Rocket and defend Goh`s Pinsir as it is kinda bashful. As Kricketina Kylie was caught in a net, Goh instructed her Heracross what to do in battle and the two showed some chemistry together. After being defended by Heracross, Goh`s Pinsir began to like Heracross. Kricketina Kylie noticed this and after Goh caught another Pinsir, she traded this Heracross to him.",
