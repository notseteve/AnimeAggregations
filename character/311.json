  "description" : "Criminal prosecutor, fanatical supporter of Kira, and the fourth Kira. Mikami is selected as the new Kira by Light, purely based on his intuition, when he needs a new Kira proxy to hide his identity. He has a sense of righteousness that stems from his childhood, though his perspective was warped over the years. Mikami wishes to punish those he considers to be evil, (which, to Light`s dismay, includes unproductive people and reformed criminals), and worships Kira as a God.",
