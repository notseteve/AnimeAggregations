  "description" : "Alfred Saillune is a member of the Saillune royal family. He is the son of Christopher Wil Brogg Saillune, who is the younger brother of the Crown Prince Philionel El Di Saillune. Alfred`s father had always been jealous of the fact that it was Philionel and not him who was the crown prince. Every time Alfred came to his father for advice, Christopher would usually just complain about his own circumstances. Not surprisingly, this resentment rubbed off on Alfred. Unlike his father, however, Alfred chose to act on his resentment, and begin a plot to seize the throne.",
