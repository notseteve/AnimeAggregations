He teaches in his small training hall and had many students in the past but most have left him by now. This is due to his keen interest in taking students able to take hardship as part of the training.\nWhile drinking with his friends, Shun hears them boasting about the success of one of their student fighters in recent tournament competitions. He suddenly exclaims, \"I also want to participate in the World Fighting Tournament\". Shun`s friends pleaded with him not to, but once Shun had mentioned his intent to fight, he was adamant and eventually joined the tournament.",
