Undertaking the mission to eradicate the world`s strife, he began armed interventions alongside Michael and Nena. He is a calm person who faithfully handles his given mission while he commands his problematic brother and sister. His rational and cool-headed demeanour provides a subtle contrast to his fiery and stubborn younger siblings. An excellent marksman, he handles the firing of the GN Mega Launcher equipped on the Gundam Throne Eins.",
