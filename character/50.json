  "description" : "Wartortle known as the Turtle Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Squirtle takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Wartortle is only acquired when a Squirtle grows past experience level 16 and is evolved into a Wartortle. Wartortle are more aggressive than Squirtle, and their shells often feature scratches obtained in battles with other Pokémon. Their ability to swim is greatly aided by their long ears and long, fluffy tail for balance. Their tails are long enough that when a Wartortle withdraws into its shell, part of the tail still sticks out. They can apparently live for thousands of years.",
