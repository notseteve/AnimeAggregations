  "description" : "The uncle of Union member Billy Katagiri. He is the commander of the A-Laws. He also has a secret connection with the Innovators. When his nephew, Billy, is recruited into the A-Laws, he installs him as an MS Technical Chief and tells him that he has high hopes in him. When the 00 Gundam destroys the ship led by Lee Zhejiang to stop the Ptolemaios II from escaping to space, Commander Katagiri reluctantly decides to accept the aid of the Innovators in order to defeat Celestial Being and prevent further sacrifices. The Innovators soon deployed in the A-Laws as licensed officers, with new, powerful suits to combat the Gundams.\nAfter the Ptolemaios II destroys the superweapon Memento Mori, the Federation government grants the A-Laws direct control of the military to further increase security. However, Homer fears that public support will eventually go to the anti-government force, Katharon and tasks Brigadier General Arthur Goodman to handle Celestial Being. His fears later realized when a number of dissidents in the regular army, led by Colonel Hank Hercule, occupied the AEU`s orbital elevator. Worried that Katharon activities will increase, Homer orders Commander Kim in the regular army to send Sergei Smirnov on a top secret mission to ask the dissidents to surrender. When negotiations fail, Commander Katagiri sends Goodman into space to use another Memento Mori to completely destroy the elevator. At the end of the season, after news of the A-Laws disbanding was broadcast, Homer commits seppuku rather than facing charges.",
