  "description" : "After years of exile in the far reaches of the solar system, the renegade Zeons who inhabit the asteroid base Axis return to the Earth Sphere, bringing with them hundreds of these transforming mobile suits. The Gaza C is based not on the Zeon mobile suit of the One Year War era, but on the worker machines which the renegades used to construct their asteroid headquarters. Although it has the firepower and thruster output of a mobile armour, the Gaza C suffers from exceptionally poor manoeuvrability. Combined with the Axis forces` fondness for mass formation tactics, this renders it vulnerable to experienced enemy pilots.",
