  "description" : "Winter Goddess is one of the old gods of Winter and Death. She comes off as a stoic and serious being while being presented in a regal presence, yet her demeanor changes somewhat when she takes notice of a branch from an oak mistletoe. As she takes ahold of it, her mood becomes much happier.\nThe Winter Goddess is first mentioned just before the night of Yule, an important cycle of the year that showcases the shift between the winter and the coming spring, by the Heralds of Yule and later by http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias].\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki",
