  "description" : "Alain`s Bisharp was revealed in the Kalos League finals and was sent out to replace Alain`s Weavile after it was defeated by Ash`s Hawlucha. The battle with Hawlucha didn`t last too long as it was damaged from its previous battle. After it missed with High Jump Kick, Bisharp finished it off with a Guillotine.\nAsh`s Goodra was its next opponent and the match started off with it using Rain Dance. When Bide wasn`t able to knock it out, it fought back with Guillotine and knocked out Goodra.\nAfter defeating Ash`s Goodra, Ash`s Greninja was sent out to face Bisharp. Having already taken a lot of damage from its previous battles, it wasn`t much of a battle as Ash`s Greninja finished it off with its first attack.",
