  "description" : "Jingoro`s Gallade resides with Jingoro near Hyakkoku City where it helps him mend wood. It spends time outside watering plants and wood graphs for him.\nIt battled against Serena`s Braixen but it had a severe type disadvantage. The battle was only to teach Serena and Serena`s Braixen about their feeling for each other and that in the long run the twig that was broken wasn`t that important. Jingoro`s Gallade seemly lost the battle after it was stopped when Serena`s Braixen hit it with a direct hit from Fire Blast.",
