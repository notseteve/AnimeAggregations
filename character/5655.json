  "description" : "Her speciality is making jewellery. During Character Change, Lulu`s hair clip becomes a purple flower. This allows Lulu to use her necklace to corrupt Heart`s Eggs. Unlike Lulu`s heritage, Nana has a Nagoya accent which results with Lulu sometimes speaking in the same dialect, which embarrasses her greatly. When Lulu used the accent in front of Amu, she complimented it by being cute surprising Lulu.",
