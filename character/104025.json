  "description" : "Susamaru is a demon who directly serves http://anidb.net/ch104020 [Muzan]. While she believes that she is one of the Twelve Demon Moons, she is actually not, as she lacks a number on her eye: the mark of a Demon Moon. Her power is in her Temari, which is incredibly hard and heavy. She uses it like a projectile weapon along with Yahaba`s ability.\nSource: Wikipedia",
