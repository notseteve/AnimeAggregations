  "description" : "Yamato Tsubaki (椿 大和 Tsubaki Yamato) is a first-year university student taking up Literature. He is also the guitarist of the band Fujin RIZING!.\nAt first glance, he`s a cool guy with good looks, but what lies beyond it is a bonafide idiot. His black hat is his trademark item. He`s very enthusiastic when it comes to his favorite things, but despite being knowledgeable at music, his guitar skills are still pretty shoddy. Usually, he ends up causing fights due to how direct he is with his words. Since he just recently moved to Nagasaki after high school, he isn`t too acquainted with the rest of Fujin RIZING!.",
