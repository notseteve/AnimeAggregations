  "description" : "Heihachi is a younger samurai, mostly self-taught, and a skilled machinist. If he did have any involvement in the war, it was as an engineer, not in direct combat. Since then, he`s been a lone nomad, going wherever he feels like, collecting machine parts, paying for his room and board by chopping wood, and so on. Aside from dealing with machinery, he can use his sword to perfectly slice wood into whatever he wants to, even toothpicks.",
