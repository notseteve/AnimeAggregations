  "description" : "The commander of the Japanese Army. The General seeks to recapture Dr. Ayanokoji so he can help them produce new secret weapons. When this fails, he relieves Dr. Amagi so that she can go searching for Dr. Ayanokoji`s lab. He also sends the spies Kagonei and Kichijoji to follow and protect the doctor and the others. The General also apparently has a preference for younger girls, such as Saki and Karinka.\nThe General`s personality is stereotypical of a soldier: rigid, efficient, and orderly. However, he admits to having not always been that way.",
