  "description" : "The fourth and last of Paptimus Scirocco`s handmade custom machines, designed expressly for Scirocco`s personal use. The O`s thick Gundarium armour renders it virtually indestructible but, thanks to its powerful thrusters and the fifty manoeuvring verniers which cover its exterior, this unique mobile suit is also supremely agile. For extra protection at close ranges, a pair of \"hidden hands\" - capable of wielding the mobile suit`s beam swords - unfold from its skirt armour. The O is also equipped with a psychic interface called the \"bio-sensor,\" which allows its Newtype pilot to control the mobile suit via mental commands, further increasing the responsiveness and manoeuvrability of this remarkable machine.",
