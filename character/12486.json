  "description" : "Fuu is a very demure but very intelligent young girl (though this goes more for book-smarts than street-smarts) who hails from a prep school and is generally the voice of reason.\nAlways very polite and considerate, she frequently speaks formally, even to Hikaru and Umi, though she sometimes has her comic moments (occasional weird quips and her tendency to chat with Umi on off-topic matters). Still, she is a valuable friend and trusted ally.\nFuu adapts relatively easily to Cephiro, seeing it much like a role-playing game (a favorite pastime of hers). She is part of an archery club, so she shows skill with her initial weapon: a bow and arrow. But interestingly, Fuu`s Magic Sword turns out to be a huge broadsword that is taller than she is. Fortunately, its magic powers also make it light enough for her to wield.\nFuu is the second to revive her Guardian, and she has fallen in love with the mysterious swordsman Ferio.\nShe is the Magic Knight of Wind and her name translates to \"Wind of the Phoenix Temple\".",
