  "description" : "This small, experimental Valkyrie was used only briefly during Space War I. The Orguss Valkyrie combined several systems from the Super Valkyrie in a much smaller mecha. The UNG did not pursue further development of this variable fighter after the war.\nNOTE: The Orguss Valkyrie is a humorous in-joke created by the animators at http://anidb.net/cr1126 [Studio Nue] and is a merging of a http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] and the Orguss from http://anidb.net/a1039 [Super Dimension Century Orguss], another animated mecha show created by http://anidb.net/cr1059 [Big West].\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/vf-orguss-valkyrie.htm",
