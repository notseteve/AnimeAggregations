  "description" : "A brown-haired, homeless man. He is the pilot of the Nova Rhino. Sakuya doesn`t seem to care that he is unemployed and homeless. Instead, he enjoys living his life the way it is. Sakuya is the first to (unknowingly) use the original Dancouga`s catchphrase \"Yatte yaruze!\" (\"Let`s do it!\"), which catches on among the team before they even learn its origin. Later, he begins feeling inferior to the rest of the team as Nova Rhino`s only function in Dancouga is the pivot foot, and desires a super-strong special attack to make up for it.\nSource: Wiki",
