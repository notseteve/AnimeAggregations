  "description" : "Misty is the Gym Leader of Cerulean City Gym. Ash first met her when she pulled him out of the lake while fishing. He took her bike and head off towards the nearest Pokemon Center to help Pikachu. Pikachu later fried her bike and she got mad and wanted Ash to replace it.\nMisty has always had a bit of a crush on Ash and it was one of the reasons she decided to travel with him. After traveling with Ash through Kanto, the Orange Islands and the Johto regions, Misty returned to her position as the Cerulean City Gym Leader while her sisters went on a trip around the world.\nMisty is a devote Water Pokémon trainer and she specializes in Water-type Pokémon. On the other hand, Misty completely despises Bug-type Pokémon and avoids them whenever possible.",
