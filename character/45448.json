  "description" : "Redof His is the Vice President of the Great Gamilas Empire.\nAlthough he is officially no. 2 in the line of succession, he is constantly sensitive to the moods of Dessler out of self-preservation. He is looked at with contempt by his subordinates, who criticize him behind his back as the emperor`s tea server, or a token Vice President.\nAmong the cabinet members, he is unique for being a businessman rather than a military officer. Actually, he keeps an eye on the internal affairs of the empire and supports the nation as an administrator, including jurisdiction of the colonial planets.",
