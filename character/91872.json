  "description" : "Rakshas is a mysterious figure exiled from the Kushan clan of the Bakiraka prior to becoming an Apostle, and presently the commander of the demon search and destroy squad of http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith]`s Band of the Hawk.\nRakshas` stated motivation for allying with Griffith is so he can ensure that one day he will be the one to cut off his \"beautiful head\". Nevertheless, he appears intimidated by Griffith. He has an arrogant and demeaning personality, belittling the http://anidb.net/ch82448 [Tapasa] for their slow reactions to his movement and marking such evidence for the Bakiraka`s fall. Rakshas` pride appears to be mostly centered on stealth, as he is never shown in battle and seems to avoid it as much as possible.\nRakshas is a hedonistic killer who plays with his victims before the kill, which is considered heresy within Bakiraka. He is also described by http://anidb.net/ch49432 [Silat], who knows him well, as relentless when chasing a target. He has a close attachment to his mask, becoming depressed enough to retreat from battle after it was broken by Silat. Rakshas seems to be a very quiet person, forming strings of words rather than sentences as he notices things, only taking the time to properly speak when addressing people directly, but his speech devolves as battles become more chaotic.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
