  "description" : "Serena`s Eevee is a very Timid Pokémon that is shy to be in front of people and other Pokémon. Serena first saw it dancing on some rocks in a field near Hyakkoku City. She thought it was very cute and that it was light on its feet and it seemed to be having fun. It was very shy, so she lured it by putting out Pofflés that she made and then did her Tripokalon performance to show Eievui her feelings.\nJessie also took a liking to it and also tried to get it by force though. She thought it had exceptional talent that would add grace to her magnificent performances. Serena and her Pokémon protected it for a bit but when Jessie`s Gourgeist used Seed Bomb on Serena, Eevee came to the rescue and used Protect to stop her from being harmed.\nAfter being saved by Eievui, Serena asked it again if it would join her on her journey and it agreed. She captured it with her Poké Ball and then let it out to meet all the other Pokémon. It seemed to like Clemont`s Bunnelby but Clemont`s Chespin got a bit upset when it didn`t initially like it.",
