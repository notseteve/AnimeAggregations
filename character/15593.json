  "description" : "Ginji Matsuzaki is the acting wakagashira (underboss) of Washimine Group. He is currently working as a street stall vendor, but was formerly an assassin nicknamed \"Hitokiri Ginji\" (Manslayer Ginji) due to his use of a katana in combat. His skills in its use are exceptional, manifesting themselves in such feats as cleaving bullets in two in midflight. Coupled with his ability to evade gunfire from multiple foes, Ginji almost completely eschews the use of firearms.\nGinji had protected Yukio for a long time and hoped that she would live out her life normally despite her family`s criminal background. He seems to regret his past as a murderer, but is willing to take up arms again for those he cares for. He is killed by Revy in a prearranged duel after he and Yukio realize they can`t defeat Balalaika and the rest of Hotel Moscow.\nIt is interesting to note that although Revy calls Ginji \"Jumbo\" because of his height, the name \"Jumbo\" may also refer to Takeshi Takeda (AKA \"Jumbo\") from the Yotsuba&! manga series with whom he shares an uncanny appearance.",
