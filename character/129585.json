  "description" : "Guzma`s Scizor is one of Guzma`s two Pokémon, and the stronger of both. It battled against Ilima`s Kangaskhan in the Top 16 round of the Alola League. Initially Scizor wasn`t able to land attacks, but then its strategy changed as Guzma made sure that Scizor always lined up in front Kangaskhan and its little one to use it as a shield. Kangaskhan was always worried that its attacks could hit the little one and because of that its moment were too slow. Despite Mega Evolving during the battle, it couldn`t keep up with Scizor and it lost the match.\nIn the second match of the Alola Pokémon League semifinals, Guzma`s Scizor faced off against Ash`s Torracat but Scizor quickly used U-turn and Guzma`s Golisopod came out to battle. Torracat held its own in that matchup and Golisopod fled, forcing Scizor to appear on the battlefield where it took a direct hit from Fire Blast and was knocked out.",
