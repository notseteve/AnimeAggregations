  "description" : "Yamagata Aritomo was one of Kenshin`s comrades. Yagamata grew a mustache since taking position of power in the Meiji government. Yamagata tries to convince Kenshin to stop carrying a sword, but Yamagata realizes that Kenshin`s openly-displayed sword and his actions as a rurouni ensure safety for others. In the anime, he appears again as the assassination target of a corrupt politician, Hashizume, but thanks to Kenshin, he was saved and Hashizume was arrested. Watsuki said that he could not get his version of Yamagata to resemble surviving photographs of the real Yamagata.",
