  "description" : "Rosa`s young daughter. She is nine years old, likes the occult, and believes strongly in Beatrice. Maria is a gullible person who takes jokes seriously, and tends to be very stubborn. She is known for her catchphrase \"uu\" when she is excited, confused, or frustrated, making her difficult to understand to some. She has a habit of being very creepy at certain moments, especially with her laugh of \"kihihihihihi...\", and expresses some paranoia a few minutes prior to docking at the island, unnerving everyone present. This may be a result of her sensitivity to the paranormal.",
