  "description" : "\"Groovy Guy\" Russel is a middle-aged American man who works for the Florida crime syndicate that`s tracking Jane. He is quite distinguishable, since he dresses like a cowboy: he has the trademark hat, boots with spurs, a revolver at the hip, bandoleer belt, tan shirt and jeans. He is not taken serious by the other bounty hunters because he is an outsider. Even Shenhua says, \"Cowboy, this no Florida\", meaning that he is in over his head.\nHowever, his skills are shown to be more than everyone thought, when he is the last bounty hunter left in the hunt for Jane and he duels Eda onboard the Lagoon. It is then later revealed that he and Eda have met previously in the United States, but Eda says they have never met. Shortly before killing him, she confesses to him to be from the CIA.",
