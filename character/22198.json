  "description" : "One of the Vosgulov-class submarine carriers which have given ZAFT control of Earth`s oceans. While these submarines are formidable in their own right, their most powerful weapons are the mobile suits and aircraft they carry. Each Vosgulov-class carrier is equipped with four dry tubes capable of storing two underwater mobile suits apiece, as well as four smaller tubes for launching fighter aircraft and three vertical catapults for regular mobile suits. However, the vessel must surface to deploy its fighters and use its vertical catapults. The Cousteau, which becomes the mothership of the elite Zala team, is named after the famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.",
