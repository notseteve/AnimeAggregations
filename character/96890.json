He`s a miraculous monster born from a collaboration between a drunkard and a http://anidb.net/ch69 [Pikachuu] stuffed toy Kagura made as a poor child who wanted to be part of the Pokemon fad.\nAlchu swore absolute loyalty to the shochu that gave birth to him, stays with it, and protects it at all times.
