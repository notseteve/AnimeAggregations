  "description" : "Porter are the Chief Purser. They help guests in the Decolora Archipelago so they can enjoy their voyage even more. In DA1, Parker`s name in the English dub was changed to Porter. When Porter introduces himself, the closed captions are correct. However, Ash Ketchum accidentally refers to him as \"Parker\" in the original airing of the episode despite the closed captions having \"Porter\". This can only mean that Ash`s voice recording sessions took place before Porter`s name was finalized.",
