  "description" : "A boy who falls into the subterranean Inner World, and becomes a Spider Rider with his new found battle spider \"partner\", Shadow. They both argue quite a lot, mainly because of Hunter`s cluelessness, ignorance and Shadow`s pride and desire to work alone as well as the belief that he doesn`t need the help of others. It is unknown whether the prophecy refers to him, thus it is unknown of he is destined to be Arachna`s salvation or its destruction. It is also shown in the TV series that he has affections for Corona and admires her good spirit but is too shy to share them. In the episode \"Smells Like Team Spider,\" he unknowingly stares at Corona while she is marveling at the flowers. When they are battling the Invectids, his mind is calmed by the image of Corona`s face. Lastly, when Igneous asks what changed Hunter`s mind about the flowers, he becomes a bit embarrassed as it was Corona`s image that changed him. Also, since Corona was the first person to discover Hunter, he has known her for the longest time, besides Shadow. Hunter may have a romantic relationship with Corona and their spiders might too. He also caught Corona in her sleeping shirt once in which she threw her pillow at him. In order for Hunter to return home, he must become an Arachna master. Hunter`s grandfather Digger Steele was also a Spider Rider and an earthen. Digger Steele knew the hero Quake. Hunter`s weapon is an Axial Pike. His catchphrase and motto is, \"Never Give Up!\"",
