  "description" : "Hitachi Noboru is a past acquaintance of Saji and Yuki. Both he and Saji joined the basketball team at the same time to pick up girls. He once asked Koizumi out, but she shot him down saying that it would just be a waste of time. Because of that, he often gets furious with Saji and tells him to stop acting like Koizumi`s boyfriend. He shows up near the end of the anime trying to make Saji come to practice and ends up challenging him to 3 on 3 basketball with Koizumi being the prize. Even though Hitachi and his team win against Saji, Koizumi still rejects Hitachi.",
