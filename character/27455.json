  "description" : "Zweilous is the evolution of Deino. It is much like its pre-evolution, the head is physically the same, having the thick black-colored fur, but after the evolution, there are two instead of one head, each having two horns instead of the previous one. The purple spots on the fur vanish, and wings appear on the back part of its body. The fur stops at the chests and opens up to fuchsia-colored striped bands on the side of its legs. It has a total four legs, with the front ones having two each claws, while the remaining two much less defined. Zweilous is also blind and its heads dislike each other. As a result the heads often turn eating into a competition. Its primary habitat is urban areas. It eats pretty much anything like it`s pre evoloution, and always eats far too much, as the heads constantly turn eating into a competition. Alphabetically, Zweilous is the last Pok√©mon. Like Dieno, Zweilous is also based upon from the Yamata no Orochi. The name is a combination meaning two heads.",
