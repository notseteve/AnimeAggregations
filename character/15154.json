He is easily recognised by his white suit and expensive car, a reason he doesn`t like Bund is because the fake blood \"Stigma\" they spray by blimp always gets all over his car. He states he is a Lord and specializes in secretive dealing for Mina outside the public`s knowledge. It was him who planned the transformation of Shoichi`s grandson into a vampire for Mina to obtain leverage.",
