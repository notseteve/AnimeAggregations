He fell in love with her as \"the cute girl who always wore a hat\" (she actually wore hats to school because she cut her bangs too short). From then on, they were a steady couple. He`s a bit fun-loving and kind of weird like Sayo and imitates as a junior cop with her, but very just and gallant, especially to Sayo.",
