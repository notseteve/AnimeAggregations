When he was young, his pack and family were slaughtered when the forest where he lived was burned to the ground by Jaguara`s troops. He was then raised by a shaman who told him that he had a purpose, explaining why the forest had sheltered him from the flames. The shaman told him that he would have a great journey ahead of him, and that journey was to find Paradise.",
