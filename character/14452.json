  "description" : "The Mayor of Tokyo City. His design is distinctly different from his American counterpart, as he is of normal height and has no monocle or top hat. A caveman version of the Mayor that is closer to the original design does make an appearance in episode 51 briefly. While less extreme in comparison to the original Mayor, the Mayor in this series is very childish and has a very short attention span. He seems to worry quite a lot when the girls are fighting, and wishes that they could cause a little less damage. The Mayor, like many of the characters in the anime, loves sweets. The Mayor also has a younger brother, who is the Principal of the school Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup attend. It was through him that Miss Bellum and the Mayor were able rearrange the classes, so that the girls would be in the same class. However, the Mayor and the Principal, don`t always get along, and even the most minor of things will set off an argument, which often time leads to name calling. He also deals with his brother when the girls aren`t doing well in class due to them skipping class to save the city.",
