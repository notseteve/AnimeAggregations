  "description" : "Ohoho is the code name given by the Legitimate Kingdom for the pop idol and pilot of the Information Alliance`s Heavy Object, http://anidb.net/ch78345 [Rush], a second generation Object. Originally assigned to a joint operation in Oceania with the Kingdom`s Object, http://anidb.net/ch78043 [Baby Magnum], Ohoho prevented http://anidb.net/ch70490 [Milinda] from providing backup to http://anidb.net/ch70488 [Qwenthur] and http://anidb.net/ch70489 [Havia]`s mission under the orders of the joint task force commander Councillor http://anidb.net/ch78270 [Flide]. They would cross paths again in Alaska in a battle between Rush and Baby Magnum, where Qwenthur confronts the pilot in her cockpit and finds out her true appearance is child-like due to genetic enhancements. After this confrontation she seems to have developed a crush on Qwethur. She even wanted him as her personal object maintainer.\nSource: Wikipedia",
