  "description" : "Roa is one of the human chimeras associated with http://anidb.net/ch10174 [Greed]`s gang out of Devil`s Nest. He is a rather large man and appears to have been alchemically combined with an ox. Roa boasts high strength while sacrificing speed, but is rather proficient in both hand-to-hand combat and the use of his trademark sledgehammer. He also has the curious ability to morph from his human form to his even larger, more powerful ox-man form and is the first chimera in the series to do so. He appears in the Ishval flashbacks as an enlisted soldier during the civil war and was presumably injured to the point that he was removed from the battlefield to be a part of human testing.",
