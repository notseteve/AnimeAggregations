  "description" : "Miyu-Miyu is simply a Nandaba famaly`s old fat cat. He is short and ill tempered. He may seem friendly, but if he wants to, he can hurt you. Also, he`s not neutered and has a crippled tail.\nHis name is a pun on Evangelion`s comic relief animal character Pen Pen and he is also voiced by Evangelion`s director Hideaki Anno.\nApperantly Miyu-Miyu can open N.O. channel wide enough to transfer information. Unlike human channel like Naota, a cat can`t understand the information being transfered through it so Haruko uses him as an interstellar communication device. The link seems to be interactive, because her superior is able to punish Haruko physically by controlling Miyu-Miyu.",
