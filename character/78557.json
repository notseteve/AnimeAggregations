He initially was angry at Pokémon Trainers and would throw rocks at them because they would join the local gyms as bodyguards and cause havoc in the city. After getting to know Ash and see how real Trainers are supposed to act, his attitude changed and he was able to see Pokémon Trainers in a new light. He asked for Pikachu`s autograph and he then planned to aim to become a Pokémon Trainer.\nKanta`s name was revealed only in the Japanese closed captions.",
