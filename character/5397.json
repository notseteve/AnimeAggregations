  "description" : "A dowdy boy whose hair is dishevelled and wears thick glasses, which are actually a form of concealment/camouflage, and is very lazy except when he`s saving Yuuna. He is actually the son of a ninja family, which has been protecting the Konnyaku family for 400 years. He reveals his true self (without glasses) when he transforms into a ninja to protect Yuuna from harm. He has been friends with Yuuna since they were children, and has also been in the same class as her since kindergarten. He also has a fear of bears, which developed because of him trying to protect Yamame from a bear in his childhood.",
