  "description" : "Sanada Saemon-no-Suke Yukimura (真田 左衛門佐 幸村 ,Sanada Yukimura?, 1567 - June 3, 1615) was a Japanese samurai, second son of the Sengoku period daimyo Sanada Masayuki (1544-1611). His proper name was Sanada Nobushige (真田信繁), named after Takeda Shingen`s younger brother Takeda Nobushige (武田信繁), who was a brave and respected warrior. Sanada Yukimura was called \"A Hero who may appear once in hundred years\" and \"crimson demon of war\", and Shimazu Tadatsune (島津忠恒, arguably the best performer in the invasion of Korea) called him the \"number one warrior in Japan.\" (\"日本一の兵\", 兵 means soldier originally, but here it is read as \"tsuwamono\" which means samurai or warrior, so it is not appropriate to translate it as soldier.)",
