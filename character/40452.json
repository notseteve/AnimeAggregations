  "description" : "Vanipeti Gang Henchmen are part of the Vanipeti Gang (バニプッチ団) and they follow the instructions that their leader Professor Tsurarer gives them. They dress up in uniforms that make them look like a Vanipeti and they often make noises to emulate a Vanipeti. They also wear masks as part of their uniform to conceal their true identities.\nTheir goal was to control the Unova region by stealing all the frozen food and give it to wild Pokémon to tame them. Once the Pokémon had memorized the delicious taste of the frozen food, the Pokémon will gladly follow his orders and he would then use their power. The Vanipeti Gang Henchmen reported to Professor Tsurarer and informed him that they had secured all the frozen food from area F and would carry it into their warehouse and store it. Professor Tsurarer decided to use a storehouse in Driftveil City to act as their headquarters and to store the frozen food but Linda and Charles realized something odd was going on when they noticed the trunks coming and going so often. Professor Tsurarer captured Linda and got his henchmen to tie her up but Charles and Ash came to her rescue.\nBoth the henchmen were knocked out by Linda`s Timburr and Pikachu after their Vanipeti were overpowered and then were arrested and taken away by Officer Jenny (Isshu).",
