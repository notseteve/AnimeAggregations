  "description" : "Nekomiya Saburou is a third-year at Otogi Academy described by the narrator as a \"Pretty Boy.\" Knowledgeable about http://anidb.net/ch16163 [Ryoushi] and the http://anidb.net/ch20883 [Otogi Bank], he takes it upon himself to \"train\" Ryoushi, though his motivation is unclear. His hair is shaped into cat ears, and his name, attitude and mannerisms are catlike (i.e. meowing after every sentence). He is apparently a skilled fighter who easily overcomes Ryoushi. He is based on Puss in Boots. He is first shown in episode 6 where http://anidb.net/ch16161 [Ryouko] saved him from delinquents in a flashback.\nIn episode 11 it is revealed that his motivation to help Ryoushi was because of his failure to protect Ryouko in the past when she saved him from bullies.",
