  "description" : "The RX-78NT1 is the fourth Gundam unit created by the Federation Forces during the One Year War. Redesigned for use by ace pilot Amuro Ray, whose success in battle was seen as evidence of his Newtype powers, this Gundam was given the designation \"NT1.\" Unlike Zeon`s Newtype weapons, the Gundam NT1 doesn`t have a psycommu interface; instead, its designers concentrated on making it highly responsive and maneuverable. Its special features include magnet-coated joints for increased responsiveness, a new type of panoramic cockpit display, and pop-up gatling guns in its forearms. The Gundam NT1 can also be fitted with optional Chobham armor for extra protection, increasing its overall weight to a massive 95 tons.",
