She is very quiet and shy due to the horrible things she has seen, and is a frequent target for kidnapping due to her abilities. Thanks to Garrod and the Freeden crew she begins to open up, and eventually falls in love with Garrod. Although she has paranormal abilities, she has never once considered herself a Newtype. In Gundam X, she and Garrod have two character songs each.",
