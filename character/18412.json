  "description" : "The Viscount of Druitt, Lord Aleister Chamber, is a noble who is known for his taste in fine art, wine and food. He becoms a main suspect in the Jack the Ripper murder case. During the investigation, he is found kidnapping women and selling their body parts on the black market. He is later arrested by Scotland Yard, although he is suspected to have bribed his way out of prison when he is again seen in public. He graduated from medical school, but does not practice medicine. He relates anything he sees as beautiful to a woman, and is particularly infatuated with a mysterious girl he met at a ball, who was in fact Ciel in disguise. He was most probably based from Montague John Druitt who was suspected of being Jack the Ripper.",
