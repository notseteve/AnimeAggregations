  "description" : "Tia Harribel is the Tercera Espada, signified by the \"3\" tattooed on the inside of her right breast, she is also the only current female Espada. She is very calm and rarely speaks, and when she does it`s fairly serious, such as when she tells her three female fracción Apache, Mila Rose, and Sun-Sun that being afraid of an Espada`s released form is a natural reaction. The remnants of Harribel`s hollow mask are covered by her coat and collar most of the time; her mask covers the lower portion of her face from her nose down, extending down her neck and out to either side of her chest, although still leaving much of her breasts exposed. In the manga, her breasts are partially shown; however in the anime they are completely covered.",
