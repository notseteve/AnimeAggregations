  "description" : "Vileplume is a huge flower-like Pok√©mon that is a larger and stronger evolution of Gloom. Vileplumes can be obtained by using a Leaf Stone with a Gloom.\nVileplume is known for its extremely offensive stench that comes from its large red flower. Vileplume uses this stench in battle, catching its foes off guard when they start to back away from the horrible smell. However, Vileplume`s flower can actually be a hindrance in battle due to it being very heavy and bulky. Due to of its weight, Vileplume walks very slowly, and it often must use its hands to help support the flower. Vileplume can be found in forests and they like to stay low to the ground. When they sleep, their huge petals droop over their head and they blend in more with the plants around them. They also release toxic, dense pollen into the air in this position so animals don`t go near them. At night, they sometimes gather together to perform odd rituals - during this time they release toxic pollen to deter intruders. The white markings on this flower are larger in the female than in the male. Paul uses Vileplume to battle Tyrogue, but his Vileplume is useless for Fighting-type Pokemon.",
