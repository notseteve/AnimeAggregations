  "description" : "Torigaya is Washizu`s only friend until Washizu started opening himself to other people. He usually acts cocky and arrogant when he is with Washizu. He is very fond of children. In the anime, he unusually (and unexplainably) shrinks, which only Washizu notices.\nKeita was actually female the whole time, with a boyish appearance. At the end of the anime, Keita unexplainably becomes completely feminine, which was extremely shocking to Washizu.\nSource: Wikipedia",
