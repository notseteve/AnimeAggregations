  "description" : "The DÃ©cima Espada, signified by the \"10\" tattooed to his left shoulder. What remains of his hollow mask is the jawbone, which rests on his chin. He is the largest, but not the brightest, of the Espada, as he relies upon Ulquiorra Schiffer to explain things and give him orders while in battle. Yammy relies primarily on his brute strength and cero blasts in battle, taking little interest in using his sword until he is overpowered.",
