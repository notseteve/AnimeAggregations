  "description" : "Shishigou Kairi is a freelance necromancer. He summoned http://anidb.net/ch88728 [Saber of Red] with a splinter of the Round Table.\nKairi is the seventh generation head of the Shishigou family, surprising for a family whose origins lie in the Far East where magecraft had a lesser standing. It was thought that he would follow in the footsteps of his father, Touki Shishigou, whose treatise had been highly praised at the Clock Tower of the Mage`s Association. The curse of the previous Shishigou generation has activated on Kairi, resulting him unable to produce children. His parents decided that Kairi should adopt a distant relative as his daughter, who they hoped will receive his Magic Crest. Unfortunately, she died as they tried transferring Kairi`s Crest onto her. He was devastated when she died and accepted that the Shishigou would end with his generation. Rather than following the similar path of a researcher, he left his family and education behind him before the end of his third year there, taking on the path of a bounty hunter and freelancer. He didn`t cut all ties with the Association and latest job he took was from http://anidb.net/ch91565 [Rocco Belfeban].\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
