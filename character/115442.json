  "description" : "Appearance\nPina is a white Dall sheep with big horns. He is considered very handsome by most animals. As a student in Cherryton High School, he is usually seen wearing the school uniform. During drama club practices, he wears a black shirt instead of a traditionally white one.\nPersonality\nPina is smart, cocky and laid-back. Though he enjoys provoking carnivores with his words, he is not a bad person. His eccentric personality and naturally charming demeanor earns him the admiration and love of many females within Cherryton High School. However, his playboy nature has him forgetting the names of women that he is currently in a relationship with, often recalling the wrong name of said female and abruptly ending the relationship.\nSource: Beastars Wiki",
