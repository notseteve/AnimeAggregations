  "description" : "Luna Luna is a member from the Calibara tribe located in the southern jungles. The Calibara tribe were once rivals of the Wild Elves, but now they`re mostly extinguished. She is the strongest warrior of her tribe, and is the guardian of its historic ruins where the \"Great Power\" is held. It is later revealed that this \"Great Power\" is the \"Sacred Treasure Fortress Bligh\", a massive mobile fortress that Huit`s mother Cyan once sought. She sometimes greets her invaders with either a fascinating dance or a death dance. Luna Luna has the bravery of a warrior and the character of an innocent maiden, and her fighting dance is a mixture of both. She fights using four tentacles that extend from her hair, and her skin color changes with her personality and fighting style. When she is in her innocent, fair-skinned form, she is known as the \"Sun Dancer\". Out of mockery at how Huit addresses Annelotte, she calls the latter \"brother\".\nSource: Wiki",
