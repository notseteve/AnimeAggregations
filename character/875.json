  "description" : "Sceptile is the final evolution of Treecko. Sceptile`s power is unmatched in the jungle, and they are thus the dominant species in such environments. Sceptile`s bodies are configured for battling prowess and superior mobility in jungle environments, with large, sharp leaves protruding from their arms and legs that can easily cut large trees. As caretakers of the forest, these Pok√©mon carefully grow trees and plants with loving care. The orb-like seeds on a Sceptile`s back are filled to the brim with nutrients, which Sceptile use to revitalize the trees in their care. Sceptile regulate their body temperature by basking in sunlight.\nIn the anime Battle Frontier saga, Ash`s Grovyle evolves into a Sceptile during a battle with a Tropius. Even after evolution, Sceptile retains its rebellious personality. Ash`s Sceptile is initially unable to use any attacks, due to the psychological impact of a Meganium`s rejection. However, it regains the ability to use its attacks, and it later learns the SolarBeam attack.",
