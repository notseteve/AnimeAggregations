  "description" : "Panpour is known as the Spray Pok√©mon. It is part of a trio that seems to be inspired by the three wise monkeys motif; with its eyes closed, Panpour represents \"see no evil\". It used to live in forests in ancient times, but its body changed so it could live on the waterside more easily. It can store water in the tuft on its head.\nIn the anime, Panpour appears under the ownership of Cress, where it wins in a battle against Ash`s Pikachu.",
