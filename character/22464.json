  "description" : "Cissy`s Seadra was the first Pok√©mon that Cissy revealed to Ash for their gym match. Ash pulled out his dex and it stated that Seadra`s were known for their horrible disposition but they posesses both strength and speed. After hearing the dex entry, Ash quickly commented that Cissy`s Seadra wasn`t going to win any beauty contests either. Cissy`s Seadra didn`t take Ash`s comment very well and hit him with a Water Gun attack in the face.\nDuring the Water Gun accuracy challenge, Tracey was impressed how accurate is was by being able to hit all the stationary cans and the moving ones as well. The match ended up in a draw though as both Cissy`s Seadra and Ash`s Squirtle both hit the final target at the same time.",
