  "description" : "Von Helsing speaks (in the English dub) with a heavy German accent and commands a Zeon fleet ordered by Colonel Killing to perform a nuclear attack on Side 6.\nHelsing`s fleet is captured by Earth Federation forces a few hours before the set time for the nuclear launch. Von Helsing showed considerable concern over the nature of Killing`s plan, and it is possible that he in fact allowed his fleet to be intercepted by the Federation to stop Killing`s genocidal plan.",
