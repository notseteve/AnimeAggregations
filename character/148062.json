  "description" : "Da Cider (ダ・サイダー) is the antagonist-turned-deuteragonist of the Lamune &40 Series.\nIntroduced in NG Knight Lamune & 40 as Don Harmage`s minions before Lamune Baba and party discover he is one of the good guys, being the descendant of the first generation Cider before the latter was brainwashed to do the warlock`s bidding. Eventually freed from his influence in the HaraHara World arc, Cider accepts his destiny to join Lamune on their quest to destroy Goburiki. He often makes puns; however, others around him especially Lesqua find them to be quite lame and unfunny. When enraged, he fires bullets all over the place. Even after he joins the good side, he still maintains a rivalry with Lamune Baba. He shares his catchphrase やったやるぜ！ (yatte yaru ze!) with Shinobu Fujiwara (Dancougar) and Franky (One Piece), all whom share the same seiyuu.\nIn the VS Knight Lamune & 40 Fire, he joins Lamunade Baba`s party to defeat Aburahm and becoming the co-pilot of Kaiser Fire.",
