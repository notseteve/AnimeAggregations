  "description" : "Mars is a main member of Team Galactic.\nAt Team Galactic`s headquarters, she used her Purugly to stop Ash and his friends from saving Azelf, Uxie and Mesprit. She later arrived at Mt. Coronet along with Cyrus, Saturn, Jupiter and Charon, and assisted her boss in using the Lake Trio`s powers and the Orbs to summon the legendary Pokémon Dialga and Palkia. After the portal to the new world opened, even though she wanted to enter it with Cyrus, she was stopped when she received a negative response, because he didn`t deem her and the other Team Galactic members worthy enough of the world he wanted to create. Despite that, when Cyrus went through the rapidly closing portal, she still tried to follow him, but her move was halted by Saturn. She was then shown to be devastated at losing her boss, who vanished into the new universe.\nAfter Team Galactic`s plan had been thwarted by Ash and the others, she was arrested along with Saturn and Jupiter.",
