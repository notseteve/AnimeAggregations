  "description" : "Zakuro is Dokuro`s younger nine-year-old angel sister, though she looks significantly older, and has a far larger bust size than her older sister. She has the super-human powers of most angels and wears a dress modelled after a naval officer`s uniform, as well as an eyepatch on her left eye, for unknown reasons and is unusually polite, addressing people with the formal \"-san\" suffix after their names as opposed to the informal \"-kun\" or \"-chan\". Calm and soft-spoken, she is quite proficient in battle. Her weapon is a wet towel named \"Eckilsax\" which can split into two or more for close combat, as well as stretching itself to bind the opponent. In the second anime series, she moves in with Sakura and Dokuro. She seems to get on well with Sakura and appears to have developed a crush on him, although she sometimes suggests that Dokuro kill Sakura only to realize what she`s saying and apologize but it is usually too late by then.",
