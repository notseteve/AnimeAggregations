  "description" : "Mizutani Fumiki is less skilled at baseball than some of the other members, and occasionally fumbles catches. This leads to Abe calling him the Crap Left. Many of Mizutani`s hits at bat are entirely based on luck; he admits that he doesn`t have a good eye for the ball. He appears to be the most simple-minded of the Nishiura team, often sharing the same goofiness as Mihashi. Mizutani appears to enjoy listening to music, as he is almost always seen with headphones on outside of practice.",
