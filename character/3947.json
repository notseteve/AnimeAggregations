  "description" : "* Ability: Change coins into whirlwinds\nB.J. loves hip-hop music. He has a tendency to lie a lot, particularly about who he is when fighting other power users.\nWhen we first meet him he convinces another power user that he is Robert Haydn. His defeat at the real Robert Haydn`s hands spurs Ueki to challenge him the first time.\nHe is somewhat a pervert especially towards Ai. During Ueki`s first battle with him, he maximizes the speed of his whirlwinds to see her underwear and during their second meeting, he rubbed her body which resulted with a punch his face.",
