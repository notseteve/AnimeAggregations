  "description" : "The Master of Lancer, Kayneth is a nobleman from the Magus Association, Lord of the house of El-Melloi and a prodigy at magecraft. His artifact is stolen by his pupil, Waver Velvet, but he manages to obtain another artifact and summon Lancer instead. While he holds the command spells for Lancer, the energy to materialize the Servant is maintained by Sola-Ui. He is confident in his abilities and takes pride in his heritage, but finds the extent of Kiritsugu`s untraditional and underhanded tactics both offensive and unexpectedly challenging to overcome.\nSource: Wikipedia",
