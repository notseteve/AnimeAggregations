  "description" : "Oskar von Reuenthal was an Imperial Fleet Admiral who served as the Chief of High Command Office, Governor-General of the former Alliance territory, and was one of the \"Twin Pillars\" of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard]`s Goldenlöwe Dynasty. Nicknamed the \"Bewitching Eyes\" for his http://anidb.net/t1065 [heterochromatic eyes], Reuenthal was a brilliant commander and was considered to be second only to Reinhard in terms of strategic ability. He was a close friend of fellow Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch193 [Wolfgang Mittermeyer], the Supreme Fleet Commander and the other one of the Twin Pillars of the Goldenlöwe Dynasty. The two of them were some of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s earliest supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles ruling the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [first Empire]. However, after complex scheming by various interests behind the scenes, Reuenthal ended up being forced into rising in rebellion against his Kaiser, only to fall in battle.\nFleet Admiral von Reuenthal had been regarded as one of the five best tacticians of that era, and also proved himself to be a capable administrator as the Governor-General of the occupied Alliance territories.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
