During the Third Great Shinobi World War, Team Minato was assigned to destroy the Kannabi Bridge. Rin was kidnapped during the course of the mission, and her captors, http://anidb.net/ch12200 [Iwagakure] ninja, tortured her with genjutsu to find out if she knew anything about Konoha`s war efforts. Rin refused to speak, Kakashi and http://anidb.net/ch10928 [Obito] staged a rescue effort, and, although they succeeded, Obito was crushed in a cave-in caused by the fleeing captors. Before he died, he asked Rin to implant his Sharingan into Kakashi`s damaged eye. After the procedure was completed, Rin and Kakashi were forced to flee the continuing cave-in, and, with the help of http://anidb.net/ch8866 [Minato], went on to complete their mission.",
