Presently, Jinta reunited with him when he was searching for Menma. He visited their old clubhouse and found that Poppo was living there. Poppo explains that he works part-time jobs to earn money. When he makes enough, he goes on trips around the world. Because of this, Poppo does not attend high school.\nPoppo seems to have questionable interests: Jinta found several pornographic magazines upon entering the clubhouse.
