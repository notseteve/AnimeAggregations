  "description" : "Princess Ally of the Parfum Palace is a spoiled brat that always tries to get her way. She visited Lord Shabboneau and took his heirloom Pokémon Flute. He didn`t protest as he owed a lot to Princess Ally`s father.\nAsh and his friends confronted Princess Ally at the Parfum Palace to return the Pokémon Flute but she stubbornly refused. She took a liking to Pikachu and offered Ash gold and jewels in exchange for it, but he refused. She then offered to battle Pikachu for the Flute to which an angry Ash and Pikachu agreed to. Pikachu won the match against Princess Ally`s Furfrou but she tricked them as she said the flute was only the consolation prize.\nPrincess Ally then got a crush on Clemont after he stood up to her and began yelling at her and told her she wouldn`t have any friends if she kept being so selfish. She took his scolding as a sign that he liked her, which wasn`t the case. Bonnie agreed to allow Princess Ally to keep him in exchange for the Pokémon Flute. Clemont stayed at the palace until he created an android version of himself while he escaped.",
