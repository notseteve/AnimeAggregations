  "description" : "Motoharu Kaidou is a student from Class A, which consists of the most superior students of Babel, although he considers himself one of the \"leftovers\" of that class. He gives Akatsuki the nickname of \"Akkii\" and declares himself Akatsuki`s best friend after meeting him the first time. He appears to be much more powerful than he lets on, and seems to have a secret agenda of his own. He has, however, not yet confronted Akatsuki directly, whom he believes has yet to reveal his full strength.",
