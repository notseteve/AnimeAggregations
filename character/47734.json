  "description" : "The chief engineer of the Cha-Cha Maru, Mikhail Diagilev might be the most loyal supporter of Tita on board. His service goes back to Tita`s father the previous owner of the Cha-Cha Maru. He still bears guilt of allowing Tita`s father to die when he jettisoned the engineering section eleven years prior and would die rather than seeing Tita die as well.\nSource: Wikipedia",
