  "description" : "Mayu is a childish girl in junior high school who refuses to go to school. Her one and only friend she could trust in life, a ferret named Myuu, dies around when she meets Kouhei and the other main characters. As soon as something bad happens, she starts yelling the ferret`s name and crying uncontrollably. In order to help her grow up, Kouhei gets her mixed in with his class. Her favorite food is a teriyaki burger. She also likes things that are long like a ferret, and takes a fancy to Rumi`s hair and even strange plush snakes.\nSource: Wikipedia",
