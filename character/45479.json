  "description" : "Cronicle Asher is the younger brother of the Zanscare Empire`s queen Maria Pure Armonia and uncle to Shakti Kareen. He is one of the Zanscare Empire`s ace pilots. He forms a rivalry with Uso Ewin that mirrors the rivalry between Char Aznable and Amuro Ray. He is a soldier who will do as he is ordered, but is noted of being critical of pilots who will bomb an area just to draw out a single renegade mobile suit. However he is also a person who will not complain or criticize an order handed down from a superior officer to do the very same action.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
