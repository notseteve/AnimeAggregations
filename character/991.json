  "description" : "Torkoal exhales an always present cloud of smoke through its nostrils and through holes in its body and has a dark gray stone shell. It also consumes coal. Torkoal fills the hollows in its shell with coal and burns it - its strength is diminished without this supply. It will search through whole mountains to find it. If attacked, this Pokemon spouts thick black smoke in order to retreat. If this is not possible, this Pok√©mon needs more coal for energy. It lets off a sound that is similar to a locomotive`s horn when emitting smoke from its nostrils.\nIn the anime, Ash and friends help protect a Torkoal from the guardian of the place which consists of a Steelix. After saving it, Ash captures it. His Torkoal displays a large amount of affection for him and usually starts crying at random moments since it has low self esteem and usually does everything wrong, like diving into the ocean. Upon his return to Kanto to participate in the Battle Frontier, Ash left Torkoal and Glalie with Professor Oak.",
