  "description" : "Tamami is very catlike and has many catgirl personality traits. She is very hyperactive and has kept her cat-like ability to scale walls with ease. Tamami is the bride of Gai, the White Tiger (Byakko) but says she`s too young. It is noted that Gai is protective of her and always tries to help her out of danger. A defining trait of hers is that she`s occasionally business-oriented in both seasons. Her color image is white.\nWhenever you cannot find her she is most likely in a grassy place taking a nap. She is afraid of cars and traffic because in her past life she was a cat who died after she was hit by a car.\nHer hairstyle represents a cat`s ears and she belongs to the Intermediate rank. In the second Season Tamami is in the Senior rank due to her achievements in the human world.",
