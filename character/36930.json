  "description" : "A spellmaster, a human who made a contract with a demon and becomes capable of using their powers, who is assigned to Oga`s class. The difference between simple contractors and spellmasters is not clear and may be just a matter of experience. It is not known which demon made the contract, but it is implied to be a member of the royal family, as Hilda recognises the seal on his hand. He seems to have made the contract a number of years before, as a very young Toujou remembers seeing the spell on his shoulder. He wears a bandana, long, black dishevelled hair and is always seen smoking. He is also quite perverted, shamelessly flirting with Kunieda and her subordinates, peeking up Hilda`s skirt and also groping her breasts during their fight.",
