  "description" : "The Space Defense Robot (SDR) Phalanx Mk XII was the final destroid designed during Space War I to act as a fleet defense mecha. After the space worthy conversion of the http://anidb.net/ch48774 [CVS-101 Prometheus] and the http://anidb.net/ch48825 [SLV-111 Daedalus] carriers they were docked with the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] and required a special unit mecha to defend both vessels. Development of the Phalanx began during the war in July 2009 and quickly reached rollout in December of that year. Roughly 20 Phalanx destroids were built aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] shipboard factories. Armed with dozens of missiles in two large launchers, the Phalanx made an excellent semi-mobile missile-based battery (minor variants featured armaments such as a head-mounted gatling gun). During the final battle of Space War I against the Zentradi Boddole Zer Main Fleet, the Phalanx units were repainted and refitted to fire long-range reaction warheads for use against space warships. When the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] broke through the Zentradi fleet defenses and entered the interior of the massive http://anidb.net/ch48908 [Fulbtzs-Berrentzs] command vessel, all the Phalanx units unleashed their missiles and aided in the swift destruction of the enemy flagship.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/destroid-phalanx.htm",
