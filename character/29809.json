He carries with him a burden of blame from his family for the death of his mother, which he did not cause. But because of his troubled past and problems at school, Akito is maliciously referred to as a devil by his family. As the ring leader of a vicious group of hooligans, Akito and his thugs spend their days bullying the school. But things started to change when Sana came along, he became more nicer and stopped his bullying with the girls in his class.\nHe maintains that persona outside of school by hiding his true feelings and responding with anger when confronted with any personal problem.",
