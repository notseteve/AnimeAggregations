  "description" : "A former victim of a Mafia child smuggling group based in Amsterdam, Triela was one among many who regularly suffered abuse in the form of drugs, torture, rape and mutilation which was taped as a snuff film. She was rescued by a pair of Europol detectives, one of whom was her future handler, Hilshire. After being mortally wounded in a gunfight, Hilshire`s partner bravely used the last of her strength to perform CPR on Triela, enabling Hilshire to save the child`s life.\nExtremely pragmatic with just a hint of rebellion, Triela has a sarcastic wit and prefers to wear masculine clothing. She serves as a sort of mentor to the other girls of the SWA and, of them all, she retains the most realistic outlook on their situation. She is given a minimal of conditioning, like Henrietta, and is collecting a great variety of teddy bears. Triela`s preferred weapons are the SIG-Sauer P230 SL pistol, the M1897 Trench Shotgun with the bayonet attachment, the H&K G3A3 battle rifle, and the H&K P7M8 pistol.",
