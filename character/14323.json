  "description" : "Shuuji`s best friend. Atsushi is a mature, open, down-to-earth guy who holds a fascination for the military. Atsushi always looks out for others, as can be seen during the Sapporo raid where he`s desperately trying to keep his friends out of harm`s way. He decides to join the JSDF to protect the girl he loves, Akemi, despite being aware that she will never love him back. When he`s finally in the army, he`s appalled at the bad state the country is in, and never knows what exactly the weapon \"Chise\" is since the other soldiers never gave him a clear answer.\nHe dies when Chise destroys the city he`s in, holding Akemi`s photo in his hand.",
