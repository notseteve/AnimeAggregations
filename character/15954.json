  "description" : "Ami when not at school, spends most of her time working in her father`s resturant, Kurinoan. She is Junta Momonari`s childhood friend and secretly loves him, but tries to hide it from everyone, including herself. She is the only girl who doesn`t bring about an allergic reaction in Junta, and additionally the only girl immune to the Mega-Playboy`s ability to seduce women. The last is something Karin considers a key part in the plan to stop the Mega-Playboy: if Junta and Ami stay together, she can nullify the Mega-Playboy`s charms and the future won`t be overcrowded.",
