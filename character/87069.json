  "description" : "While searching in the forest to get Pokémon, Rocket Gang first encountered Mimikyu. Moments later Ash and his classmates arrived who were also looking for Pokémon to catch. Both groups attempted to get Mimikyu.\nNot much is known about this Pokémon beyond the fact that it wears an old rag that looks just like a Pikachu and its actual appearance is unknown. It is said that scholars who tried seeing what was underneath died from the shock. Meowth decided to look under the Pikachu-shaped piece of cloth Jessie`s Mimikyu was wearing and he ended up going into some kind of delusional state that his consciousness suddenly faded and when he came to, he was walking through a dark tunnel. He was then joined by a group of super cute Pokémon but then the surroundings suddenly turned really creepy and he fell into a bottomless pit. Jessie and James threw water on Meowth before he died.\nJessie`s Mimikyu absolutely hates Pikachu. Mimikkyu doesn`t take on the appearance of a Pikachu because it likes it and it actually the appearance of Pikachu is what Mimikkyu hates the most in the entire world. Since it hates Pikachu, Mimikkyu decided to fight alongside Rocket Gang.",
