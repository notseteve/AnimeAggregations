  "description" : "Saito is regarded as one of the least cyberized among the members of http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9]. He can handle any automatic firearm with deadly accuracy and precision, but his primary role is as the unit`s tactical sniper. Saito`s left arm is cybernetic, allowing him to support and steady extremely large sniper weapons with superhuman skill. His left eye was replaced with the \"Hawkeye\", a prosthetic eye that interfaces with satellites to allow for shots of incredible accuracy.",
