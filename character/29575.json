  "description" : "Oktavia von Seckendorff is the witch form of Miki Sayaka. She briefly appears at the end of Episode 8 and battles with Sakura Kyouko in Episode 9. Her Labyrinth is filled with calls for attention -- probably to Kamijou Kyousuke. Initially, the outer areas of her Labyrinth are filled with train tracks, perhaps a reflection of the train station where she became a witch. Later on, the entrance area becomes a long corridor filled with concert posters. The center of the Labyrinth appears to be a distorted concert hall, where the seats fill the domed ceiling. Her weapons appear to be manifested wheels, and the concert hall is populated with a spectral string orchestra.\nSource: Puella Magi Wiki",
