  "description" : "Commonly known as Break, he is a member of Pandora and a servant of the Reinsworth household. Like Sharon, Break`s appearance doesn`t change from the ten year gap between Oz entering and leaving the Abyss. He has a legal contract with the Mad Hatter. Break is often seen with a doll on his shoulder (which he calls Emily). He adores sweets and cakes. From the outside, Break seems like a carefree character, never serious and always smiling. When needs be, however, Break shows his `dangerous` and evil side. Reim tells Oz that Break wasn`t always the way he is now. Before, after losing his eye, he was a bitter and angry person, never smiling. However, through the kindness of Shelly, Sharon`s mother, he began to open up. He has sworn absolute loyalty to Shelly.",
