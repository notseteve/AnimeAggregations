  "description" : "Stephen Wilcox appears in the third episode on the I-Jin fortress, making a minor appearance as the builder of many of the I-Jin machinery, including Otto Lilienthal`s Glider, Genjou-sanzou`s heart mechanism (never directly stated, but very likely), and the I-Jin Fortress itself, which appears to be steam powered instead of nuclear powered as Joker implies. He is portrayed as being built into the Fortress and visibly insane. He is killed with Jean-Henri Fabre by Drake Anderson.",
