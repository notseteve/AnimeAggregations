  "description" : "Usahara is an aggressive, bad-tempered rabbit who chain smokes. He often gets annoyed at Uruno and kicks him into the sky, but in reality, it seems he does care for him, as shown when Uruno disappears in episode 26. He is revealed to have bouts of melancholy, which usually resolve themselves in a matter of days.\nSource: wikipedia",
