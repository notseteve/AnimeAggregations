  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch50253 [Nube] initially encounters this youkai after having a particularly lucky streak at a pachinko parlor. After feeding it some senbei, it follows him back to school where it causes one good thing after another for the students in his class. He tries to convince the youkai that they don`t need it, scaring it away, but it returns to end up saving Hiroshi from a possibly fatal accident. In another incident, Zashiki Warashi reveals a power of reversing fortunes, making http://anidb.net/ch82870 [Yukime] become befuddled by disasters, the worst of which was witnessing a date between her beloved Nube and http://anidb.net/ch82851 [Ritsuko-sensei].\nWikipedia",
