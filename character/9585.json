  "description" : "Yamaguchi Kumiko is a 23-year-old university graduate, and is newly hired at Shirokin Gakuen. She is very idealistic, and wants to inspire her students and help them graduate high school. Since the age of 7, when her parents died, Kumiko has been living with http://anidb.net/ch18245 [her grandfather], who is the head of a yakuza group. Despite this strange upbringing and the bizarre mannerisms she has picked up from it, like her use of yakuza slang and a habit of running from the police, Kumiko is a kind girl who has a strong faith in her students. At first, they belittled her, doing things like nicknaming her \"Yankumi\" in an attempt to tease her, but she wasn`t troubled by any of their attempts (in fact actually liking the nickname) and quickly earned their respect.\nSource: Wikipedia",
