  "description" : "A very open-minded girl that can not refuse to entertain new ideas and let other people express their ideas, even if it means possible negative effects on herself or her property. Her name derives from the phrase \"Ooraka na ko\" (大らかな子) which means \"big-hearted girl\". She usually wears her hair in a pony tail restrained by a big ribbon and keeps her hands buried inside the sleeves of her school uniform; possibly because it is a size or two too big for her. The zip on the side of her skirt is always open.",
