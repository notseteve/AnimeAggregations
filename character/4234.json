Her parents died when she was two years old, and has since lived together with her older brother, Hiro.

She has also learned how to cook and do house chores herself, due to her not wanting to worry Hiro. Her friend and classmate, Tetsumasa, seems to have feelings for her. She finds out that Hiro wasn`t her older brother before her parents died.",
