  "description" : "A master swordsman, Ruka is the former captain of the fencing team and a former member of the Student Council. His cunning, manipulative behaviour belies a hidden desperation to live, and his influence on Juri becomes one of the major turning points for her character.\nIt is not clear whether or not Ruka was a Duellist before he returns. When he returns, he takes Shiori as his girlfriend, though it`s made clear that he was simply manipulating her. He duels Utena once with Shiori as his Rose Bride and loses. He then dumps Shiori and begins to court Juri. From him we learn that it was Juri who told him, \"If you believe in miracles they will occur.\" Ruka says he is in love with Juri and kisses her during a fencing match; he states that he believes she was in love with him before he disappeared. As in the manga, it is due to his feelings for her that he wants her to claim the power of Dios and defeat Utena in order to save her from her burdens. Juri denies she was ever in love with him. Ruka subsequently appears as Juri`s Rose Bride in her final duel, after which he leaves the school. His \"death\" is reported by the Shadow Girls, though unlike the manga, the reality of his death is debatable.",
