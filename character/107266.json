It has bright green, large, circular eyes with small pupils and a large, thin yellow beak.

It has a ruff of feathers on its head, with the largest clump pointing backwards and being surrounded by small singular feathers. Its feet are black, webbed, and have three toes. Its wings seem to be perpetually extended.\nCramorant is a gluttonous Pokémon that can swallow other Pokémon whole. Its preferred prey are Arrokuda, but sometimes it swallows other Pokémon such as Pikachu, attempting to spit them out if they realise their mistake. They aren`t very intelligent to the point where they can`t remember which Pokémon they fight in mid battle, but never forget trainers that they trust. However, they try to attack their trainers if they steal food from them.",
