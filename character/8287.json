  "description" : "The daughter of a struggling standup comedian, Anna joined Kaleido Stage at the same time as Mia and Sora, and the three of them are all good friends. Anna`s boyish appearance appeals to many of the Kaleido Stage`s female fans. Anna feels that it is her duty to introduce comedy to Kaleido Stage and wants to focus on playing comical parts. However Anna`s ideas for comedic improvisation are usually pretty far fetched and are promptly shot down by Sora and Mia before they get off the ground.",
