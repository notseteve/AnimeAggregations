  "description" : "He is the Ashikabi of Hikari and Hibiki. He is 25 years old. He works as a freelancer, whose motto is \"We solve their problem with a price\". Friend of the late husband of Miya who appears to be in hostel with him. Miya apparently has a very low opinion of him easily referring to him as `trash` or `scum` right in front of his face. Seo also takes odd jobs and manual labour. He does show is detests of how the MBI works and of its C.E.O. (Minaka). He sometimes eats for free at Miya`s when he is low on money (while his sekirei apologize). Seo has a gruff, wild look about him but a good man to rely on. It has been said that he has an \"ability\" given to him by Takehito Asama. This ability is shown to be cancellation of Sekirei`s abilities, by grabbing a hold of them, as shown during his brief fight with Tsukiumi and the meeting with the Sanada Nishi. While Seo is aware that Minato is an Ashikabi, Seo makes no aggressive action against the hero and they usually just have friendly conversations with each other. Saying I liked you from the start for some reason. He is able to tell the number of Sekirei a person has by his `strong nose`. He mention he built the secret room were Matsu hides in for Takehito.\nSource: wiki",
