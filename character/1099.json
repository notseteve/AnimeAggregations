  "description" : "Turtwig are small, turtle-like Pokémon, and are one of the three starter Pokémon for the Sinnoh region. Its prominent jawbone may denote a relationship to the snapping turtle. Its green and yellow body is covered by a shell. A small seedling grows on its head, similar to the plant bulb on Bulbasaur`s back and the leaf on Chikorita`s head.\nThe soil-based shell on its back grows stronger when it absorbs water. Turtwig survives by carrying out photosynthesis with its whole body. The leaf on its head will wilt if it becomes thirsty. As a result, it lives in areas that are close to lakes.\nTurtwig makes its first Pokémon anime appearance in the first episode of the Diamond and Pearl series, \"Following a Maiden Voyage!\", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokémon in Professor Rowan`s lab. Ash catches a wild Turtwig in the episode: \"Gettin` Twiggy With It,\" and Turtwig also makes an appearance in \"The Grass-Type is Always Greener!\" as one of the Pokémon used by Eterna City`s Gym Leader Gardenia.",
