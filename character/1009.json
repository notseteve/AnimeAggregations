  "description" : "A girl in Ryuuji`s class. She has a well-regulated and beautiful appearance though is unable to stomach company from others. Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature at 143.6 cm, she is given the nickname \"Palmtop Tiger\". Her under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions by boys her age, but she turns down every one of them. She comes from a rich family but due to bad family relations, she has taken to living on her own. However, since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji`s house; so much so that she is almost considered a member of his family. At the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with his best friend Kitamura Yuusaku to the point that she drools at her picture collection of him and gets nervous every time he appears. Due to this, Taiga and Ryuuji team up to help each other get into a relationship with each other`s best friend. However, as the story goes on, she too develops feelings for Ryuuji, commenting once how even though they are in a big room, they still sit so close together like at his cramped apartment.",
