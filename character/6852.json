  "description" : "The fifth Rozen Maiden doll and the first to appear in the series. She embodies the traditional Victorian aristocrat. She is extremely demanding and can seem unappreciative of others. Her favourite words are \"tea\", \"servant\" and \"What?\" She seems to enjoy lecturing, slapping, and generally abusing Jun, her medium, at every opportunity. She is perceived as rather angry, but it is a fa√ßade that she puts up to show that she feels that she is most deserving of becoming Alice. Shinku is also perceived as being cold, but she is actually very protective of, and cares deeply for, her sisters and for Jun. Shinku`s presence at the Sakurada home has led to other Rozen Maidens appearing there. She hates cats because one almost swallowed her wind-up key in the past.",
