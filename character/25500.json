  "description" : "Richard Lancelot is a young man, yet is described as legendary for his skills and marksmanship. Richard comes from the Scottish Highlands, and is an expert with both swords and horses. He is generally depicted as being a gentleman with a cool head for tactics and decisions.\nRichard often rides a robotic horse named Steed, which has high-powered thrusters and the ability to fly, run, and function in space. However, it was not capable of long space travels, so Steed is kept stored in Bismarck`s cargo bay, being used mainly to travel down to planets from orbit or utilized on the planet`s surface. Steed is almost sentient in nature and is capable of recognizing his master`s voice and working independently when Richard is in danger.",
