  "description" : "Saisei is one of the Goyousei`s resurrection specialists. She was resurrected by Saishi after she was killed. Saisei uses a naginata to fight with, Saishi uses her bare fists and brute strength. Combat seems to be a last resort for the two of them, as they usually use zombies to fight their battles. They control the element of Wood. Saisei was killed by Akira, but he respected her since she was fighting so hard to protect Shinrei, whom she secretly loved. Saishi, on the other hand, was viewed as a monster by Akira, and he used his best technique to destroy every cell in her body.",
