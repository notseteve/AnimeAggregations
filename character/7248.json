  "description" : "Hatake Kakashi is the leader and teacher of Team 7, consisting of http://anidb.net/ch7196 [Uchiha Sasuke], http://anidb.net/ch7194 [Haruno Sakura], and http://anidb.net/ch240 [Uzumaki Naruto]. He is initially portrayed as a detached and apathetic figure, but as the series progresses, his loyalty to his friends and students becomes increasingly apparent. Kakashi`s past has been extensively explored in the series, resulting in a gaiden being devoted to his past experiences. Kakashi has appeared in several pieces of Naruto media, including three of the four featured films in the series, all of the original video animations, and several video games.",
