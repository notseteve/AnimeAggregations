  "description" : "This series` Gangreen Gang, who appeared in episode 14. Like in the original series, they are more of a group of juvenile delinquents than criminals. Each of the Gangreen Gang members came from families that resemble themselves, except that the families do not share the gang`s green skin color. Unlike previous villains, it is never shown how the Gangreen Gang received the black light, however they do emit the black aura that signifies a black light villain/monster. The Gangreen Gang continually seeks to cause trouble, going as far as playing a prank on the restaurant manager to get free food or spraying graffiti all over a building. Unlike the originals, the Gangreen Gang is less cowardly and will face those who stand in their way. Unfortunately, they`re incredibly weak against the Powerpuff Girls Z and are unable to overpower or outsmart them. Besides Fuzzy Lumpkins, the Gangreen Gang are the only characters unable to return to normal through Professor Utonium`s Chemical Z Particle Ray. True to their name, they are represented by the color green, instead of a symbol.",
