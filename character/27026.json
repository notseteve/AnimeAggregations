  "description" : "Koga, also known as Koga the Kicker, is the youngest known member of Kisara`s team. Unlike Ikki and Ukita, he seems to bear grudges against Ken`ichi, whom he plans to take down himself, and Miu, whom he calls Neko Shoujo (Cat Girl). While he possesses a carefree attitude, he is very loyal to Ragnarok and is eager to deliver punishments to those who betray the gang. He first appears to have a flare for Miu, but upon seeing her in action, becomes mortified and ceases all attempts to have her.\nKoga was originally teamed with Takeda and Ukita as part of the Three Man Army. His current whereabouts are unknown.",
