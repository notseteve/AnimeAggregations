  "description" : "Giriko is a Demon Weapon and an ally to the witch Arachne. He lives for fighting, and likes to be destructive, however, he is completely sub-servant to Arachne, whom he refers to as ane-san (a respectful term translating to `older sister`). Giriko takes the form of a chain saw in weapon form. Although he is a weapon like Tsubaki or Soul, he openly states his hatred for Shibusen, claiming that he wants to follow his own path, rather than be used by a meister. Giriko is not very good at remembering faces, as seen when he does not recognize Maka when she infiltrates into Arachne`s castle with the other Shibusen students. He develops a rivalry with Justin Law, as the two have very conflicting ideas, he also calls Justin \"Father\" (this is a joke at the fact that Justin dresses like a Catholic priest). He is an expert golem maker and can even make them in the midst of combat.",
