  "description" : "I`a is a Seafolk person who travels the seas and the world. Her friend Kanoa travels with her but it was unclear if they were married. She does shows with her Osyamari to support them as Kanoa hasn`t found any significant treasures. They heard of a storm that sunk a ship long ago near Melemele Island and they managed to find the ship but were unable to recover the cargo because a Dadarin was guarding it.\nI`a spent some time with Lana`s Popplio to help it train to get stronger so it could properly use the Z-Move Hydro Vortex. The training proved successful as it was able to use the move to save everyone on the boat from drowning in the whirlpool created by Dadarin.",
