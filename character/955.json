  "description" : "Delcatty is a highly laid back, unconcerned species of Pokemon. It prefers to live completely free of priorities, doing only what it pleases at its own pace. Since these include eating and sleeping, its daily routine is completely random. However, its activities are generally more nocturnal than not. Delcatty does not stake a claim on a personal lair like other more territorial species of Pokemon. Rather, it makes it a habit to wander about and seek out more comfortable spots when it decides it`s time to sleep. Even here it is not defensive; if another Pok√©mon approaches its spot, Delcatty will take off for another place rather than fight. Domesticated Delcatty are highly regarded by fashion-trendy female trainers who often use the Pokemon in competitions revolving around its style and fur.",
