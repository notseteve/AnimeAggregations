  "description" : "Bak Chang is a 29-year-old Chinese descendant of a German wizard who was one of the founders of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order]. He is also the leader of the Black Order`s http://anidb.net/ch32500 [Asia Branch], a post also previously occupied by his great-grandfather. Like http://anidb.net/ch7365 [Komui], he is a man completely aware of his duties and will follow God`s will strictly.\nHe is able to use spells that control the structure of the building because of his great-grandfather`s seal and his bloodline. Acting as the director of the branch, he is a cold and very responsible leader. However, he is actually very caring toward others. He has a stalker-like infatuation on http://anidb.net/ch7123 [Lenalee], as seen by a folder of photos of her he carries everywhere with him. He also has a close relationship with http://anidb.net/ch32781 [For].\nSource: Wikipedia",
