  "description" : "Merle is a 13-year-old cat-girl and childhood friend of Van. She is jealous of Van`s increasingly close relationship with Hitomi, but eventually comes to accept Hitomi; and becomes a loyal friend to her. As Van becomes conflicted in his relationship with Hitomi, Merle reveals to him that he loves Hitomi and that Merle had recognized it long before he did. She encourages Van to go find Hitomi after Hitomi unexpectedly returns to the Mystic Moon and assures Van that his feelings will reach Hitomi.\nAn orphan, she has since devotedly followed Van since she was picked up by the Fanelian courts. She never hesitates to protect Van at all costs (the twins Eriya and Nariya spared Van`s life once when Merle hauled herself in front of him, seeing their past selves reflected on her).",
