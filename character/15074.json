  "description" : "Paula is a member of the space colony resistance group \"Satyricon\", and the pilot of the GS-9900 G-Falcon. She is a loudmouthed, tomboyish orphan, and one of the first children born after the colony drop that ended the 7th Space War. She is the only person her age in Satyricon, and as such, she takes an immediate liking to Garrod when he is brought to the asteroid base. When Garrod accepts the rebels` offer to repair the Double X, she makes him her partner, as the G-Falcon has the ability to dock with most Gundam-type Mobile Suits. At the end of the series, she and the rest of the Freeden engineering crew open up a repair shop.",
