  "description" : "A mass-produced underwater mobile suit of the Earth Federation Forces. This underwater mobile suit was developed by the Federation Forces during the One Year War, using the GM as a base. Though it is now clearly obsolete, no successor was ever developed due to the reduced importance of amphibious machines, and so it still remains in service.",
