  "description" : "Team Aqua is one of the villainous teams to be found in Hoenn. They intend to raise the level of the oceans by using the power of Kyogre. Team Aqua`s leader is Archie and their rival organization is Team Magma. The uniform is a gray and white shirt, blue jeans with white circles, black gloves and a blue scarf with the Team Aqua`s symbol on it, the grunts in the manga also wear a jacket.\nThe Team Aqua history is introduced in \"Stairway to Devon\" where a member of the team infiltrated Devon Corporation and stole two capsules of Creation Fluid, but his plans are stopped by Jessie and James who want to steal the same liquid (which is really water). In \"On a Wingull and a Prayer!\", this same member takes a boat of Mr. Briney`s to escape from the police and heads for open ocean, where a Team Aqua submarine rescues him.\nTeam Aqua later appears in \"A Three Team Scheme\" and \"Unfair Weather Friends\". Their final, and most prominent appearance is in \"Gaining Groudon\" and \"The Scuffle of Legends\", when they help cause the battle between Kyogre and Groudon.",
