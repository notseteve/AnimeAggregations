  "description" : "Shana is the female lead of the show and a Flame Haze. Initially she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, going as far as to not bearing even a name. She sees Yuuji only as a Torch, an object, marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. Yuuji, in his need to humanize her, chose to name her \"Shana\" after her sword. However, she slowly opens up to Yuuji, coming to think of him as a person, despite being a Torch, and eventually comes to love him. Until she met him, she was only identified by her Flame Haze title \"Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter,\" or her sword, Nietono no Shana.",
