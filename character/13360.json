  "description" : "Soga Keena is Akuto`s classmate, who always wears a strange bird-shaped pendant that allows her to become completely invisible, even to the point of cloaking her mana, although this only applies to her body: anything she may be carrying, including her clothes and the pendant itself, remain visible. She doesn`t appear to have any other powers or magical skill apart from invisibility and flight. She is rather nonsensical, often acting based on unlikely and bizarre reasoning. She frequently steals dangerous objects from Fujiko`s room, which more often than not result in thwarting Fujiko`s carefully laid plans.\nShe is later revealed to have been childhood friends with Sai Akuto since they were at the same orphanage together, and that he had given her the bird pendant shortly before his departure. She flatly denies ever having met Akuto before meeting him at Constan for some reason, despite Akuto`s vague memories.",
