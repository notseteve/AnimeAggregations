  "description" : "Inukai Rintarou is No.6 of the Muto-assassination team. Known to have a strong sense of pride, and rather die then getting defeated and left alive. Inukai uses the Buso Renkin \"Killer Rabies,\" two mechanical dogs that are commanded by a dog flute. He claims that anyone not holding the flute will get killed when his dogs are in berserk mode. However, at one point, Gouta used this to his advantage and took Inukai`s flute, resulting in Inukai nearly getting killed by his own dogs. He can also imitate a dog`s bark. In the anime, he, Maruyama, Busujima, Chitose and Shusui were dispatched to take out Victor, but they were forced to retreat.",
