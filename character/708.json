  "description" : "Miharu is the student of Kazemi affiliated junior high class 1-2. She is a childhood friend of Nemu and Jun`ichi after Sakura left, being one year younger than them. She loves bananas, especially eating them. She adores Nemu, and behaves much like a little puppy around her â€” in fact, her nickname is Puppy. In the original game, an android patterned after her was put in place after an accident rendered her unconscious. Having no experience of the real world beyond certain memories copied from the real Miharu, Jun`ichi was tasked by Koyomi to look after her. Like the real Miharu her enthusiasm often overrules her common sense, and Jun`ichi often has to get her out of sight when her circuits start to overload. As an andriod, her power sources include bananas, solar energy, and a spring motor that needs to be wound up periodically using a key inserted into a hole on her back.",
