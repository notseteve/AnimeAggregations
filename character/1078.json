  "description" : "Gorebyss inhabits the southern seas at extreme depths. Its body is deceptively durable, so as to withstand the extreme hydrostatic pressures exercised to it at such a depth. Gorebyss`s elegant form is exquisite to behold while swimming. Gorebyss uses its thin mouth to pick at seaweed growing between rocks, but it can also use it in a much more sinister fashion. When hunting live prey, it sticks its mouth into the prey`s body and proceeds to drain it of all bodily fluids. After it feeds in this way, its body turns a more vivid pink.",
