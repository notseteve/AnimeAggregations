  "description" : "(From Lewis Carrol`s Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There) - GOTT ES Member (S Class), apparent age 16, partner and twin of Tweedledum. Special ability: \"Strom\" (German, stream or current, as in \"Electricity\"), joint ability: \"Windsto√ü\" (German, gust of wind).\nTweedledee, who is both the sister and partner of Tweedledum, has a commanding presence and values loyalty above all else. She is an \"S Class\" ES Member rivaling Alv and Dvergr. Tweedledee has the ability to control electricity and can create an effect similar to Lumiere`s Puppet. She often scolds her brother for calling her \"sister\" while on duty. Tweedledee also has a strong sense of pride. While she doesn`t agree with Eclipse`s secretive nature towards the ES Members, she still trusts her. She also seems to have a deep bond with Lumiere, probably because of their similar abilities.",
