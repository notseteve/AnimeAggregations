Their homeland is http://anidb.net/ch67159 [Avant Heim], a http://anidb.net/t7676 [phantasma] that serves as floating city. They were created by the Old Deus Artosh to fight in the ancient war, during which they leveled countless cities and massacred countless beings; for that purpose, they hold powers of mass destruction, and as a result, they are inherently condescending towards other races. The race is governed by the Council of Eighteen Wings, a permanent nine-seat committee.",
