  "description" : "Tange is a teacher and the professor emeritus of sculpture at the art institute everyone attends, elderly Tange-sensei is a long suffering supervisor to Morita. Recognizing Morita`s genius, Tange makes the mistake of taking Morita seriously and constantly finds himself stressed out while trying to control Morita. Tange`s greatest desire is to get Morita to finish his graduation project (and with Morita`s talent, it means refusing to accept unfinished works) so that he may retire in peace. When Morita is finally completes his graduation project, Tange expresses bittersweet sentiments towards the role of teacher. Despite constantly upsetting Tange, Morita greatly appreciates and respects Tange for all that he has done for Morita in their eight years together. After Morita graduates and then re-enrolls as a third year student, Morita transfers his attention to Nakamori Okina, the professor emeritus of Classical Japanese painting.\nSource: Wikipedia",
