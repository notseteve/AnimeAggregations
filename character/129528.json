  "description" : "Persian is one of the Pokemon owned and used by Nanu during his Grand Trial with Ash Ketchum. It was the third Pokémon to battle after Nanu`s Sableye was defeated. It it not the standard size of a normal Alolan Persian and is as big as a Totem Pokémon. Despite never thinking he`d have to use a Z-Move against Ash, Nanu used Black Hole Eclipse but it was cancelled out by Lycanroc`s Continental Crush. That was the turning point in the match and Ash`s Lycanroc (Dusk Form) finished off Persian with an Accelerock to pass the Ula`ula Island grand trial.",
