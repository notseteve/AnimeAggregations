  "description" : "This semi-sweet loudmouth has the hots for Kotaro and can`t stand the fact that Misha is homing in on her territory. Koboshi is depicted as a very assertive character. She loves Kotaro greatly but is too embarrassed to confess her feelings to him. She is liable to get angry and be very overprotective, causing her to be constantly irritated by Misha`s childish antics and attachment to \"her Kotaro-chan\".",
