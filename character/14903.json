  "description" : "Guyver Three is Agito Makishima , also a high school student, although of a higher class than Fukamachi. Unlike the other Guyvers, he merged with the final bio-booster symbiont deliberately. This move suits his personality, which craves power above anything else as he called himself Zeus to Chronos for he would take their Throne. He is the deadliest surviving Guyver, partly because his greater willpower enabled him to take control of the Gigantic unit from Fukamachi to merge with it himself, to become the deadliest warrior the world has ever seen: the Gigantic Dark. Deadly; yes, humane; questionable.",
