  "description" : "The Valley Windworks Employee watches over the power plant from the control room. Ash and his friends visited him to see if they could find Kotone`s lost Marill.\nHe called off the Magnemite that were chasing the group and helped them spot Marill on the monitor. Team Rocket later entered the room and he was back to sleep again.\nHe tends to sleep on the job a lot and isn`t a very reliable employee. Perhaps he is just waiting for his pension to increase so he can retire.",
