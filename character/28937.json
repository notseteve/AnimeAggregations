Named after a heroine of Russian folklore, Sasha does not like her due to Vassilisa`s sometimes childish behavior, her vanity relating to skin health care, and her weird interest in Japanese otaku culture, which she unsuccessfully tries to get Sasha interested. During the Third World War between Russia and Academy City, she betrays Annihilatus to prevent them from using Sasha and hands her over to Vento, while she stays behinds to hold off Annihilatus and Fiamma`s subordinates.",
