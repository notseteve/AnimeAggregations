  "description" : "Misaki becomes the Counter-Actor thousands of years into the future on Jurai when both Azusa and Funaho have died, causing her to go mad.\nWhen counter-actor Misaki attacked, nearly strangling Tokimi to death and viciously striking Tsunami when she tried to reason with her, Tenchi appeared in a glowing form to calm her down. The two of them kissed and disappeared from view.\nHer appearance does not fundamentally change, but she becomes clad in some kind of black and red quasi-matter that distantly resembles a dress and long gloves -- Misaki could not endure the pressure of the energy that was for various reasons contained within her, so she ended up going on a rampage through Jurai. To put a stop to it, Juraian fighters at first didn`t want to wound her mortally so they just shot at her limbs. Since she was completely unperturbed by that and refused to stop, the Emperor of Jurai at that time finally had enough and issued the order to eliminate her. So they struck and shot at places like her heart, head, and neck, resulting in her appearance. Additionally, her face grows almost unrecognizable from how her rage distorts it. ",
