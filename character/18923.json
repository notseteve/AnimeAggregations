  "description" : "Benitsubasa, also known as the \"Crimson Sekirei\", is another member of the \"Third Generation\" Disciplinary Squad. Like Musubi, she is a hand-to-hand fighter, but as stated by Haihane they are complete opposites. After her fight with Musubi and Yume (believing to be Musubi), she keeps a hatred for Musubi after she was almost thrown across the border (which was Yume`s doing). She has a habit of sticking her tongue out while fighting and hates stupid people. She wears a kimono-like shirt with one sleeve missing and has pink hair in a side ponytail with two daisy clips. Out of the three Disciplinary Squad members, she is the only one who \"loves\" her Ashikabi, as she wants Natsuo to \"open his eyes\" (make him like women), then kill both Haihane and Karasuba so she can have him all to herself. Although the rules say not to attack Ashikabi, she attacked Minato because she thinks that \"it`ll be better to get rid of him\". Her name means \"Crimson wings\" and her attacks are Shock Wave, Shredder, and Gekeishin (extreme earthquake).",
