  "description" : "A bluish iridescent boy with green hair, Clear is a quiet and shy person who`s actually the heart of Omega. He ended up in Teros where he stayed until Bolbol made him a cloak of Flying Water to cover his entire body and hold his power at bay. Clear hates himself for destroying everything he touches.\nIt was by fate that he encounters Ai after she had fallen off the submarine in the Ocean Puzzle. Clear tried to steer clear of Ai out of fear of killing her by accident. At that moment, Pist sends his minions; three strange creatures, to hunt down Clear. They manage to find him, but Clear successfully flees with Ai. Safe in a cave, Clear introduces himself to Ai as a part of Omega, in search of his \"siblings\", which are the Omega pieces. Kaze then discovers the two and attempts to destroy Clear because of his nature, but Ai objects. Just then, Pist`s three minions appeared again, and caught Ai. Clear manages to save her, but his glove came off in the struggle, unleashing his destructive power. Ai was then saved by Lisa and Yuu on Chobi, leaving Clear behind to be caught.\nLater, when Clear was last piece of Omega in existence, he was fused with his Flying Water suit to create a stable crystal for Earl Tyrant to absorb. In the series aftermath, Clear`s crystal is retrieved by Crux and given to Makenshi in FF:U After, who entrusts it to Ai in the After Spiral. Clear was inserted into the Airship Sylvia to serve in the ship`s Flying Water Recycling System.",
