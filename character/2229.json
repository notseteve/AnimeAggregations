  "description" : "Nena Trinity is the youngest of the three siblings. Outwardly presenting herself as being a cheerful young girl, she habitually smiles and makes the peace sign with her fingers. Nena seems to feel a sense of enjoyment when undertaking destructive missions, indicating a possible sociopathy. In addition to her erratic behaviour, Nena claims to be attracted to \"wild\" men, even going so far as to forcefully kiss Setsuna F Seiei upon hearing that he is the pilot of the GN-001 Gundam Exia.",
