  "description" : "Yashuhara Maehara is Shinobu`s father. In the anime, he was having marital problems with his wife, and eventually they separated; in the manga, their feud does not lead to a divorce.\nHe appears in the Love Hina Christmas Special as a taxi driver who gives a free ride to some of the Hina girls who have nothing but Su`s obscure homeland currency (and therefore can`t pay). He tells them that they are about the same age as his daughter and that he hopes that someone would take good care of her were she in such situation.\nHe is later reunited with Shinobu at the end of the Special.",
