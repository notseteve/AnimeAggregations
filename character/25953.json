  "description" : "Commonly known as Bluebeard, his real name is Gilles de Rais - a mass serial killer who seems to favour killing children in particular. Caster is a sadistic and evil Servant who derives pleasure from first providing his victims a moment of relief before terrorizing them and then killing them. He expresses an obsessive interest in Saber because he has mistaken her for Jeanne d`Arc, with whom Bluebeard has an infatuation. His sole Noble Phantasm is Prelati`s Spellbook: Text of the Sunken Spiraled City, a magical tome made from human skin which acts as a massive prana source and a guidebook for various spells of varying power, with the strongest spell capable of summoning otherworldly, self-regenerating monsters. The strength of his Noble Phantasm helps make up for his otherwise average ability in magecraft.\nSource: Wikipedia",
