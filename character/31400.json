  "description" : "Onigawara Mao is the girl with pink hair who defends Japan from the ground by using a plastic tank (the tank was officially named `White Tiger,` but she refers to it as `Mi-kun` because when she was little, she had a kitten named Mi -added the honorific kun to it-, but it got lost in a river while she was playing near it one day. She re-named the tank that so it seemed it was still there). As revealed in assorted Physical Education scenes, she is a very slow runner. Her physical ability is minimal, but she more than makes up for it with her total seriousness in the spirit of defense. It is revealed that she has no mother and her father is busy with his own work as a secret spy for the Defense Forces. Her least favorite food is carrots. Her clover pin is green.\nHer baton initiates the Defense Barrier.",
