  "description" : "Professor Sycamore`s Garchomp resides at Professor Sycamore`s lab in Lumiose City. Team Rocket infiltrated the lab and used a device on it to control it so they could figure out how to make it Mega Evolve. Unfortunately it went wrong and Professor Sycamore`s Garchomp went into a rage throughout the city. Ash went after it and followed it up the Prism Tower.\nWith the help of Ash`s Froakie, Ash and Pikachu were able to break the collar that Team Rocket put on Professor Sycamore`s Garchomp. Despite being fatigued, Professor Sycamore`s Garchomp fully recovered from the incident.",
