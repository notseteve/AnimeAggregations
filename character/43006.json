  "description" : "Edmond`s Seismitoad participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament. Edmond`s Seismitoad is a perfect match for Edmond as it Ability is Swift Swim so when it rains, its speed increases. Since Edmond seems to be able to summon rain, Edmond`s Seismitoad greatly benefits.\nInitially the battle went well as Edmond`s Seismitoad `s speed made it hard for Stephan`s Sawk to hit it. The two Pok√©mon began having a rally of heavy blows, trying to stop one another but it wasn`t until Stephan`s Sawk successfully hit it with a Low Sweep and injured it a bit, that Edmond`s Seismitoad `s speed decreased. Edmond noted that with its speed, it should be able to dodge attacks but the injury proved to be the turning point in the match and Stephan`s Sawk was able to Bulk Up and then finished it with a Close Combat. With the loss, Edmond was eliminated from the Don George Donamite Tournament by Stephan in the first round.",
