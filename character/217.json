  "description" : "Rupert Kessellink was a http://anidb.net/t2322 [Phezzani] politician who was both the son and secretary of http://anidb.net/ch204 [Adrian Rubinsky], the http://anidb.net/ch6233 [Dominion]`s last head of government. Kessellink was a highly ambitious Machiavellian schemer who saw himself as intellectually superior to everyone else and secretly plotted to eventually overthrow his father, to take his position as Phezzani Landesherr. Outwardly he served as Rubinsky`s right hand man, becoming involved in various political schemes as his father`s representative, including the arrangements for the inquiry into the loyalty of http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance] Admiral http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] and the abduction of Emperor http://anidb.net/ch225 [Erwin Josef II]. Unbeknownst to Kessellink, Rubinsky was fully aware of his son`s ambitions and in the end he had his son murdered when Kessellink tried to shoot him, on the night of http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]`s invasion of Phezzan.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
