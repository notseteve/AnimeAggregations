  "description" : "The Amakusa Catholics are a secret order of Japanese warriors. The order was formed during the Edo period when Japan banned Christianity. In order to escape persecution, they merge Shintoism and Buddhism into their Catholic beliefs to hid their religion which led the Amakusa`s creating a unique fusion of magic. While skilled magicians, the Amakusa`s are also skilled with martial arts and fighting in groups.\nSource: Wikipedia",
