  "description" : "Charmeleon known as the Flame Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Charmander takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Charmeleon is only acquired when a Charmander grows past experience level 16 and is evolved into a Charmeleon. Charmeleon are excessively savage and short-tempered by nature, and they are made to be powerful fighters as a result. The flame on its tail, carried over from its Charmander stage, may burn a bluish white when the Pokémon is excited, and the air temperature often raises to very high levels when the tail flame is waved around.",
