  "description" : "A transformable mobile suit made by Anaheim Electronics, which is supplied to the Nahel Argama after the ship loses most of its fighting strength in battle against the Sleeves at Industrial 7. It can transform into a wave rider form with the ability to enter the atmosphere on its own and fly under 1G of gravity, enabling this all-purpose attack machine to operate in all regions. Because it is a non-standard prototype that is hard to incorporate into a team formation, the Delta Plus has been assigned to the Nahel Argama, which is likewise a non-standard ship that often operates on its own.",
