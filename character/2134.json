  "description" : "The unofficial mascot of Team Dai-Gurren, Boota is a small pig-mole from Giha village, whom Simon keeps as a pet. Boota is characterized by his sunglasses and star pattern surrounding his tail. No matter how many years pass, Boota`s physical appearance does not change much. Although he can`t talk, he can understand humans, and even has near-human intelligence. His favorite spots to stay are between Youko`s breasts or on Simon`s shoulder.",
