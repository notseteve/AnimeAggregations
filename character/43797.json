  "description" : "A Silver Saint, disciple of Virgo Shaka along with Lotus Agora. He tried to kill Phoenix Ikki on Canon Island. Like Shaka, Shiva was an adept of Buddhism and relied on Shingon chants and prayer to paralyze his opponents, while performing his murderous Thousand Hands Kannon`s Attack, a lightning-fast multi-hit technique. Although a buddhist himself, Shiva was not a practitioner of his religion`s peaceful and merciful doctrine and precepts. Killed by Phoenix Ikki.\nSource: Wikipedia",
