  "description" : "Sakai Wakana lives with her father and her pet cat, Dora. Her mother is dead. Despite the fact that she is apparently very good at singing, she refuses to do so to the point of turning down Konatsu`s attempt to recruit her into her new choir club. When she was in her last year of middle school, she was too focused on her exams, she now lives with regret for being unable to say \"I`m going\", \"sorry\", and \"thank you\" to her mother. She is in the same after-school class as Wien.\nSource: Wikipedia",
