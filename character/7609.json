  "description" : "Potemayo is a mysterious creature that appeared one day in Sunao`s refrigerator. The name Potemayo comes from first two characters of potato (ポテト, poteto) and mayonnaise (マヨネーズ, mayoneezu) — what Sunao was eating at the time. At first, she could not say anything but \"honi\", a nonsense phrase which she often utters even after learning how to say a few words like Sunao`s name. Potemayo is very protective of Sunao, and if anyone tries to get close to him, she will growl and attack until they back off. When taken around with Sunao, she rides around on his head. She has the personality of a young child around two or three years of age, but has a super deformed body, complete with cat ears on her head and a fluffy, round tail.",
