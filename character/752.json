  "description" : "Murai was a http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance] officer who served in the 13th Fleet under the command of admiral http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. He was with the fleet from the very beginning, participating in the capture of http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] in the Fifth Battle of Tiamat: prior to the battle, Murai expressed concern over the amount of trust Yang Wenli had placed in the http://anidb.net/ch6224 [Rosen Ritter]`s regimental commander, http://anidb.net/ch748 [Walter von Sch√∂nkopf].\nMurai first met Yang Wenli while a commander assigned to investigate the mutiny at Econia. Murai`s impartiality and attention to details led him to conclude that Lt. Commander Yang was the more credible side in the incident.\nAfter the death of Yang, Murai left Iserlohn and returned to Heinessen as a private citizen. By doing so he swayed lukewarm supporters of the nascent Republic the opportunity to leave, stripping the numbers down to a hard core. He also felt it was time for his generation to step aside and allow younger leaders to carry on.\nUnexpectedly, Murai was selected by http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] as an civilian emissary to http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian Mintz] to ask that that the Iserlohn Corridor be closed to Imperial traffic during von Reuenthal`s rebellion.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
