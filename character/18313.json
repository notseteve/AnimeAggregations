  "description" : "Koza is http://anidb.net/ch18312 [Mukuro]`s perpetually gloomy younger sister. She has a fondness for http://anidb.net/ch4865 [Mugen] that dates back to their days of piracy, though the feeling is not quite mutual. Koza isn`t so much in love with Mugen as she is attached to him. This stems from her chronic dependency â€” she simply can`t bear to be alone, which explains why she has remained with Mukuro all this time, even though he clearly repulses her.\nShe devises a scheme to get rid of Mukuro and leave with Mugen, but as Mugen rejects her advances, she replaces him with http://anidb.net/ch18314 [Shiren]. She neglects to inform Mugen what Mukuro has in store for him. After the ship Mugen is on explodes, she manipulates http://anidb.net/ch4864 [Jin] and Mukuro into fighting, which ends in Mukuro`s death. As she is leaving with Shiren, Mugen, having survived the explosion, confronts them and cuts Shiren down with a series of lightning-quick slashes despite being rigorously weakened. Koza begs him to kill her. He pays her no heed and continues walking, leaving her exactly as she didn`t want to be: All alone.\nIt is disputable whether Koza is Mukuro`s actual sister, as, aside from their skin tone, http://anidb.net/ch4863 [Fuu] observes that they look nothing alike. Moreover, Koza states that Mukuro \"killed her mother,\" not \"their\" mother.\nSource: Wikipedia",
