  "description" : "In a space school where girls tend to go into flight attendant classes while the boys become pilots and mechanics, 16-year-old Cullen is against the norm as one of the few female piloting students aboard the Liebe Delta seen in the Ryvius. While quite capable, coming in fifth place on the piloting exams, Cullen can also be fickle and enjoys acting on her own rather than with a group of people. Seen as a background character in the initial episodes (she was the girl who returned Ikumi`s music card to him in the premier), she eventually comes into prominence later on. When she sees something she wants, she often goes to great lengths to get it - be it a music card or a boyfriend.",
