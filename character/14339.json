  "description" : "Flower is a service android who was left by her previous master at the temple and later discovered by http://anidb.net/ch30367 [Keiichirou]. She did not function initially, but began to work overnight after Keiichirou took her home. She is energetic and excitable, and likes to sing despite being tone-deaf. She also suffers from short-term memory loss, which led Keiichirou to buy her a diary. She was very loyal to him and wished to stay by him. She later became his trigger to \"feel\", which was what he needed to start singing again.\nSource: Wikipedia",
