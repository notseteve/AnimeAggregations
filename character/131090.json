  "description" : "Hatakeyama Shougo is a young man with medium-length dark hair and a stubble. He is most often seen wearing a track suit. When he wants to keep his identity hidden, Hatakeyama wears a costume that disguises him as the TV superhero Metroblue. Like Metropoliman`s costume, Hatakeyama`s Metroblue costume completely obscures his body and facial features, leaving his identity a secret.\nSource: Platinum End Wikia",
