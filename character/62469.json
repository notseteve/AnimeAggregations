  "description" : "The little sister that \"Santa\" brought to Haruma. She is sweet and very innocent, all her knowledge of the world initially derived from an instruction manual she was given before her delivery to Haruma`s home. Apparently the manual does not cover all situations and it is not really written for someone of Choko`s level of experience. Some of the information is even quite inappropriate for someone of her age... Choko appears to be a sweet girl and is very fond of her new \"onii-chan\" (affectionate term for an older brother), as she immediately identified Haruma. She always trying to be number one`s favorite for him, until she learn that she can`t be always his brothers favorite.\nSource: Wiki",
