  "description" : "The main protagonist of the game, Neptune is the goddess of Planeptune (representing the Sega Neptune). She has a childish personality and lots of energy, and likes to jump headfirst into danger. However, her personality completely changes once she transforms into Purple Heart, taking on a much more serious and mature character. Her dungeon ability is Hammer Crush, which allows Neptune to destroy breakable obstacles. Her default weapon is a sword, and uses a gun for her Gun command.\nSource: Wikipedia",
