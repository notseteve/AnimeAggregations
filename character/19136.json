  "description" : "Yukimaru was a student of http://anidb.net/ch66623 [Mariya Enshirou] before http://anidb.net/ch4864 [Jin] killed him. Yukimaru contends that, unlike http://anidb.net/ch17987 [Ogura], he wants to take Jin`s life not to avenge Enshirou but to make a name for himself. Unwilling to fight him, Jin takes a dive off the edge of a waterfall. Yukimaru is persistent and hunts him down once more. They clash katana, and Jin gives him one last chance to turn back. Yukimaru charges on. Jin runs him through. On his dying breath, shedding a tear, Yukimaru whispers that he only \"wanted to be like you.\" Jin and http://anidb.net/ch4863 [Fuu] bury him, and pray before his grave. When Fuu asks Jin about who he was, Jin replies Yukimaru \"was like a little brother\".\nSource: Wikipedia",
