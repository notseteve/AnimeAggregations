This transformable assault machine can change into a mobile armor form specialized for high-speed space combat, and armed with powerful beam cannons and beam claws. The Chaos is also equipped with a pair of mobile weapon pods similar to the DRAGOON system used in the previous war, and its improved control system allows these weapons to be used even by ordinary pilots. After the Chaos Gundam is captured during the attack on Armory One, it is assigned to Sting Oakley of the Phantom Pain special forces unit.",
