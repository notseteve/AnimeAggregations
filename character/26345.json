  "description" : "Amelia is a female bounty hunter. She initially meets Vash the Stampede aboard a sand steamer where he comes to her aid while she is being accosted by thugs. Vash attempts to win her over with flattery and fanciful tales of them being destined to meet, but she shrugs him off. Amelia shows a peculiar and often humorous allergic reaction to being touched by men which causes her to break out and itch. She is strong and capable as a bounty hunter, but often show signs of youth and innocence especially when it comes to her low tolerance for alcohol. She is initially little more than irritated by Vash and later brought to anger by his actions, but she gradually comes to accept his outlook on life.\n Source: Wiki",
