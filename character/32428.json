  "description" : "A cruel and selfish black-haired girl who says she understands and respects bullying but resents being called a bully herself, Yozora`s difficult personality drives away anyone who might wish to make friends with her before she meets http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka]. She is physically abusive towards, and often argues with, http://anidb.net/ch32430 [Sena] and manipulative towards http://anidb.net/ch32434 [Maria], who she cons into giving up an empty room for the use of the http://anidb.net/ch37939 [Neighbor`s Club], and http://anidb.net/ch32431 [Yukimura], who she fools into working for the club as a cross-dressing cosplay maid. The only person she can`t insult is http://anidb.net/ch32429 [Rika], as Rika takes whatever insult she gives her and deflects it back with a dirty joke that leaves her tired - to the point where she just does what Rika says (like cross-dress for example) rather than argue.\nShe is Kodaka`s childhood friend, though at the time, he believed that she was a boy, calling her \"Sora\"; her nickname for him was \"Taka.\" On the day that Kodaka moved, she intended to wear a skirt and reveal her gender to him but was too embarrassed to do so. Kodaka eventually recognized her after she had to cut her hair short due to it catching on fire. She seems to have feelings for Kodaka.\nSource: Wiki",
