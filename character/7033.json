  "description" : "Lt. Commander Yuriko Star is another by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure and attepts to obey the rules in almost every situation. However, she, unlike http://anidb.net/ch7036 [Yamamoto], has no problem telling http://anidb.net/ch7034 [Tylor] that he has done something wrong and will even resort to slapping him when he gets too far out of line. Yuriko also tries to downplay her gender, making herself a soldier first, and then a woman. This is a sore subject for her when someone comments about Tylor`s obvious attraction to her looks, pointing out that she has never used her appearance to get ahead; an equally sore point for her is her budding attraction to him. Yuriko is one of the most rational and level-headed officers on the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. While she is senior to Yamamoto, her speciality as an intelligence officer places her outside the chain of command.",
