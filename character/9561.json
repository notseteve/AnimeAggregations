  "description" : "The Seventh Neck, he is the only Orochi who was able to resist becoming completely evil. Souma is the lone protector of Himeko and Chikane for most of the series and later plays a part in bringing the Orochi down. He has a very high social standing at their school, comparable to Chikane`s, and most of their fellow students believe they are dating, though in truth they rarely interact until the Orochi events. Like Chikane, he is in love with Himeko and is extremely protective of her, fighting to keep her safe from Orochi.\nSouma`s mecha, Take no Yamikazuchi, is a humanoid robot that possesses more varied attacks than most of the other mecha, which it conceals within its own body. It is similar to that of Gundam and attack is similar to Big O.\nIn personal combat, Souma initially uses his own body and sometimes his motorcycle. Later on, he adopts the sword and fighting-style of his brother Tsubasa, significantly increasing his power.\nHe carries the mark of Orochi on his forehead.",
