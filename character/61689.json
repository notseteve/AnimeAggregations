  "description" : "Shishigami Bang is a ninja from Ikaruga village. He lost his home in the Ikaruga Civil War and his master Tenjou at the hands of Jin Kisaragi, and he and his followers began living in Kagutsuchi waiting for the right moment to strike back at Jin and the NOL. There, he declares himself a hero of love and justice, and dedicates himself to exterminating evil and overturning injustice wherever he goes. He is quite overexuberant, prone to speeches and tangents as well as making dramatic entrances.\nSource: Wiki",
