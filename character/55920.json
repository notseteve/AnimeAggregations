  "description" : "Makoto Nanaya is another classmate of Noel`s and Jin`s from the Military Academy, much like Tsubaki. She is a beastkin with squirrel-like features, and is considerably hyperactive with a short attention span. She is outgoing, adventurous, and has inhuman reflexes. She has a few complexes about her race but nonetheless proudly acknowledges who she is. She seems to be working under the NOL`s Intelligence Division, but is actually an informant for Sector Seven. In the true ending, she transfers to Sector Seven in order to protect Noel. In battle, she fights using her specially-made cross tonfas.\nSource: Wiki",
