  "description" : "Ekans is a snake-like Pokémon that swallows whole the eggs of small bird Pokémon, such as Pidgey or Spearow. Its highly poisonous fangs make it a hazard in the wild. Ekans also shares other characteristics as snakes, such as using its tongue to test the air for the presence of prey, and shedding its skin.\nThe name Ekans is the word snake backwards. Ekans` Japanese name, Arbo, is a reversal by morae of the word boa. Ekans` name in the English beta version was also Arbo.\nIn the anime, the most notable Ekans was owned by Jessie, who had received it before episode 2 for her birthday. It later evolved into an Arbok and was released.\nEkans evolves into Arbok at level 22.",
