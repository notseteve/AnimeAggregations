  "description" : "Originally called the Dai-Gunzan while under the command of Thymilph, one of Lordgenome`s four generals, it`s essentially a walking battleship many times larger than conventional Gunmen, with numerous heavy artillery gun turrets and heavy armour. The arms attached to the control tower serves as the hangar bay launchers for its housed Gunmen. After its capture by Team Dai-Gurren, it is renamed the \"Dai-Gurren\" (although still referred to by its original name by the Beastmen) by Kamina and remodelled to accommodate the Brigade members, sporting a red color scheme and a different tower on the head as the original was destroyed when Simon took control of it using Lagann.",
