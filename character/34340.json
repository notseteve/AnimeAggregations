  "description" : "Grim is http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi]`s online friend, who talks to him almost everyday through their mutual favorite online game, Ensue. He often encourages http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi] to have more courage while dealing with the \"third dimension\", and supports http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi] throughout his many ordeals. He is very interested in the New Generation incidents and frequently updates http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi] with gory details regarding the murders. As his interests in anime, manga, and games are very similar to http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi]`s, the two get along very well, although later his frequent use of the \"Whose eyes are those eyes?\" phrase seriously bothers http://anidb.net/ch1140 [Takumi].",
