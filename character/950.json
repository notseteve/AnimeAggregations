  "description" : "Hariyama is the larger and stronger evolved form of the Makuhita species. Hariyama appears like a sumo wrestler; its hands are large and orange, and it wears blue trousers with a yellow tare - one of kendo bogu. Hariyama trains by stomping on the ground to build power, and it gains enough power so that its arm thrusts can snap telephone poles in two and send ten-ton trucks flying. Although it appears fat, its bulk is made up almost entirely of muscle. If Hariyama were to tighten these muscles, it would be as hard as a rock. It has been known to challenge people to contests of strength without any hesitation. It has even been observed to stand on train tracks and stop trains in their tracks using forearm thrusts as a display of its power.",
