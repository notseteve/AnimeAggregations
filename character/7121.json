  "description" : "Chitose represents the Human Realm, although she has a crush on Ikkou, she constantly denies it. Even though she acts nice much of the time, she fails to admit her crush to herself or Ikkou, often harming him when others flirt with him. She is usually the first to put Ikkou down as low as possible at times as well as beat him with little provocation. She enjoys horror films.",
