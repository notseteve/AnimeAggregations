  "description" : "Cyndaquil is the Fire-type Starter Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. In Pokémon Emerald you may get Cyndaquil after completing the Hoenn Dex. Cyndaquil are covered with a flame-resistant, dull-yellow fur with a rich streak of blue running from the tip of its snout over its head and spreading out to cover the majority of its back. There are also four spots of red fur on the back. When Cyndaquil is frightened or angry, it can focus its internal energy to produce blazing \"spines\" of flame from the spots. While it is a quadruped, Cyndaquil is more than capable of maneuvering on two legs. They are based on an echidna.\nCyndaquil are generally timid and not naturally aggressive, and are often seen curled into a ball for protection. This action leaves its back and special flame-emitting vent fur exposed. When predators and enemies stalk too close, Cyndaquil unleashes a furious flame from the vents as a deterrent. If provoked further, Cyndaquil will intensify its flames, creating a smokescreen that will buy it some time to escape.\nCyndaquil has made numerous appearances in the Pokémon anime, mostly under the control of Ash. His Cyndaquil often seemed to be very shy and relaxed, often sleeping. At first, it needed time to warm up and use flamethrower, but with some training from Ash, it is now able to use its flamethrower whenever it wants. It also possesses prodigious dodging capabilities, able to wear opponents down by simply evading long series of attacks over an extended period of time. Cyndaquil is currently at Professor Oak`s lab since Ash decided to make a fresh start when going to Hoenn, and therefore, left all of its Pokémon, except Pikachu, with Professor Oak.",
