  "description" : "God is probably the most egoistic of the children. He is initially engaged with Hime, but she doesn`t seem to approve too much. God usually opposes the others` opinions and decisions, especially in regard to Kashira. [spoiler=\"minor spoiler from episode 8\"]He joins General Mosar for a while, telling him how guns work.[/spoiler] On a number of occasions, he tries to betray the group by running away alone or with Hime, Asuka or his followers Snake and O-Taku, but mostly without success. While he mostly acts foolishly selfish and gets the group in trouble, on rare occasions it is depicted that he actually does care for beings besides himself.\nSource: Wikipedia",
