  "description" : "Asami Mizuki is Aoba`s cousin, the same age as her. Mizuki`s father, Asami Isamu, is a younger brother of the Tsukishima sisters` mother and a world-renowned mountain climber. As a result of his father`s travels, Mizuki has been raised overseas most of his life, and is an excellent climber.\nHe returns to Japan to attend high school, living with the Tsukishimas and enrolling in Seishu at the same time as Aoba. He is popular with girls but he claims to be interested in only Aoba. He initially sees Ko as his rival for Aoba, and frequently mentions that Ko does not yet pitch 100 mph, but he comes to recognize Yuhei Azuma as a rival as well.\nHe is in the mountaineering club at school, which he uses as a cover for his own activities as the club activities are below his skills. He is often depicted free climbing tall structures, such as poles and school buildings, without equipment.\nSource: wiki",
