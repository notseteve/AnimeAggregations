  "description" : "This old archer (Rou Yumihei) was a member of the hero`s old party. He`s very interested in the female chest and likes to mention Female Knights lack of thereof. He addresses concerns about Hero isolating himself from humanity due to his immense power. His title comes from the fact that he can inflict arrow-like wounds from afar, despite he is never seen carrying a bow or any kind of long range weapon.\nAfter the party split, he started to work as a butler (Shitsuji) for the Winter Prince.",
