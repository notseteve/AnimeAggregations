  "description" : "Coworker and sidekick to Azuma, from the Kansai area. Initially, Kawachi`s knowledge is superior to Azuma`s, but as the story develops he becomes the fall guy and comedic relief with jokes focused on his incessant cry of \"What was that?!\" (lit. \"Nanyate?!\") and numerous outrageous reactions/illusions in every chapter. He considers Azuma to be his rival, but the two develop a dynamic that is more like an older and younger brother, Kawachi being more experienced than Azuma in the world beyond bread initially, but gradually changed to one with Azuma knowing lots of knowledge while Kawachi can only act surprised.",
