  "description" : "The main character, the only son of a noble family in the kingdom of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear. After a kidnapping incident, all of his childhood memories were erased, causing him to be very selfish and ignorant of the real world. His only hobby is swordsmanship. Luke also possesses the ability to create a \"hyperresonance\" on his own, an extremely powerful ability when two fonists of the same type use their abilities in tandem.\nAs the anime progresses, Luke learns that he is actually the \"replica\" (clone) of Asch, the real Luke fon Fabre. This event, along with the abandonment of his friends, prompts Luke to change himself for the better.",
