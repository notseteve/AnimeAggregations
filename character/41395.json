  "description" : "Sentarou is a wild 1st-year high school student who meets incoming student http://anidb.net/ch41399 [Kaoru] at Higashi High School. Sentarou is mistakenly thought of as a thug by his peers, who fear him. Though tall and gifted with prodigious physical strength, Sentarou is also straightforward and bighearted. He`s the exact opposite of Kaoru, yet somehow they hit it off when Sentarou starts to share his boundless love for jazz. The drums are Sentarou`s instrument of choice.\nSource: Official Site",
