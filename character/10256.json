  "description" : "Gokyouya is a gray-haired Inukami who near-constantly wears a white lab coat and may be the oldest of http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s Inukami. Gokyouya is studying seriously to become a doctor at some point and is close friends with two other of Kaoru`s Inukami, http://anidb.net/ch10258 [Furano] and http://anidb.net/ch10257 [Tensou]. Before she became Kaoru`s inukami, she was linked by contract to Keita`s father, Souta; she still has warm feelings for him, which she has in part transferred to http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita]. Gokyouya may be the oldest of Kaoru`s inukami, as she displays greater maturity than many of her pack members.",
