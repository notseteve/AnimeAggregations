  "description" : "Mikage Aki is a first year who is also a member of the Equestrian Club and Yuugo`s love interest. She is studying to inherit her family business, a cow and horse farm specialising in raising Ban`ei race horses. Aki usually has a cheerful and positive attitude and she eventually develops feelings for Yuugo, leading to them start dating. Her father is very protective and was wary of her relationship with Yuugo at first, but some time later starts seeing him as a man worthy of becoming her husband, just like the rest of her family. Once her family goes into difficulties and is forced to sell all their horses, Aki, encouraged by Yuugo, expresses her will to not inherit the farm and become a professional jockey instead. Thus she starts studying to enter college with his help. Another curious trait of Aki`s is that she is so enthusiastic about horses that she can easily memorise every fact related to them, thus Yuugo makes use of it to help with her studies.\nSource: Wikipedia",
