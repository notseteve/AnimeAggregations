  "description" : "Previously known as Cyber-29, Data 7 is Cybersix`s younger brother. His body was greatly damaged after a playtime accident and Von Reichter transplanted Cyber-29`s brain into the body of a panther. Data 7 has a series of flashbacks of his death, before remembering Cybersix. After seeing a picture of the two of them as children, Data 7 remembers how he died and who Cybersix was. Data 7 joins Cybersix in her plans to foil Von Reichter`s plans. He is seen to be very protective of Cybersix, often taking hits for her, trying desperately to save her from danger and even following her during a school field trip after she is injured from the previous night. Data 7 is very obedient to Cybersix, and rarely ever objects to what she says.",
