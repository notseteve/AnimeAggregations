  "description" : "He has just returned to the town after spending four years at university. He has a considerable grudge against Miki because she used to bully him, despite being younger than him. Kankuro is a case study (however comic) of the effects of abuse: despite being a 24 year old university graduate, his heart is forever unable to grow up and move on unless he destroys the traumatic past that is Miki. Kankuro is somewhat thickheaded, and often fails to take Miki`s resourcefulness into account when he schemes against her. He almost always adds \"nya\" at the end of his sentences. He is poor and does odd jobs in order to support himself. What adds to Kankuro`s hate towards Miki is the fact that Miki can never remember his name.",
