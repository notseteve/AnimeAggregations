Zeus initiated a new system within Heaven that ranks angels according to their ability: High, Middle and Low ranking angels that caused disturbance among them. This new system made Judas uneasy because the previously kind hearted angels now treat each other as if they are competing for a higher rank. Middle ranked angels were envy of the higher ranked angels and looks down on the low ranking angels whereas the low ranking angels were envy of the middle ranked angels and therefore will do anything to be promoted. Also has an atittude that once an angel committed a sin, should never be forgiven and therefore were sent to purged - which means the sinners will be turned into monsters and thrown to Forest of Darkness and each year, the number of angels who were purged increases. And when those monsters escaped the forest, he sealed them within a box called the Case of Hope. But later, when he found out that humans were increasing in number and atrocities as well, he ordered Pandora to released the contents of the box in the human world.\nImage Color: Platinum",
