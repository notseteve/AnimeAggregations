  "description" : "Visquez is the temporary Vermilion City Gym Leader while Lt. Surge is away on a training journey and she is authorized to award the Thunder Badge to those who defeat her in his stead. Ash Ketchum decided to battle against her as she was nearby and a relatively high rank in the Pokémon World Championships standings with a rank of 2,109.\nShe accepted his challenge to a battle and explained to him that Lt. Surge had spoken about Ash Ketchum to her. He described a young man and his Pikachu who once brilliantly battled and defeated him and his partner Raichu. This story intrigued her and was a reason for her accepting his challenge.\nThe battle was a two-on-two which Ash Ketchum ended up winning. As a result of that battle, there was a change in the Pokémon World Championships standings, putting Ash Ketchum`s rank at 3763.",
