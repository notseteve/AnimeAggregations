  "description" : "One of the Six Heroes, Hakumen is a samurai-like \"Susano`o unit\" wielding a sword as tall as he is and wearing a mask that completely hides his face. He led mankind to defeat the Black Beast, then when attempting to warn the people that they needed to \"repent for their sins\" lest the Black Beast return, they trapped him in a space known as the \"Edge\", where he drifted for nearly a hundred years until Kokonoe discovered him. Kokonoe helped him return to the world, hoping to use him to defeat Terumi, but he set out to achieve his own agendas before being completely salvaged from the Edge. During his journey, he has also shown tremendous respect towards Bang and his unyielding spirit, something truly out-of-character for Hakumen. Hakumen often says that his sword will purify the world of sin and vanquish that which is evil. In truth, Hakumen is Jin`s future self, whose soul was bound to the Susano`o unit after falling into the Gates of Sheol and saved by Rachel. He now possesses the ability to generate seemingly indefinite amounts of energy at will, and his sword, the Nox Nyctores Interfectum is apparently capable of killing characters that otherwise could not be killed or would simply regenerate (i.e. Ragna, Nu, and Arakune). In Continuum Shift, he was taken and imprisoned by Kokonoe, but eventually freed by Rachel, agreeing to help her find Terumi.",
