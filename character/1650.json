  "description" : "A female ninja nicknamed Sacchan, supposedly from the Oniwabanshuu. She is severely short-sighted and often loses her glasses to hilarious - or disastrous - effect. She met Gintoki when she fell through his roof. When she tried to convince him that he had inappropriate relations with her, he briefly played along despite knowing that she was lying to get his help. Ever since that incident, she has become infatuated with him, much to his exasperation. Her feelings for him seem to be encouraged, as she enjoys being put down and threatened by him, due to her extreme masochism. Her attacks are mostly based on natto and bondage. She often follows Gintoki and the rest of Yorozuya around much to his knowledge, throwing objects at her to come out when he needs her help. She cannot stand Zenzo Hattori, her former Oniwaban comrade, and has \"attacked\" him at his \"weak point\" (his haemorrhoids) by shoving in an enormous syringe, wooden barbecue stick and a candle.",
