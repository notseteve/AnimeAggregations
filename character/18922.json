  "description" : "Haihane, also known as the \"Indigo Sekirei\", is a member of the \"Third Generation\" Disciplinary Squad. Her weapons of choice are her gauntlets that have scythe-like claws for the fingers. After her fight with Tsukiumi, she has a hatred for her because she almost drowned. She wears a tattered kimono over her bandaged body, giving her aGrim Reaper-like appearance. She is also prone to laughing to the point that it hurts her stomach and she likes to tease Benitsubasa about her breasts. She is also forgetful, once forgetting that she had her claws on while trying to block her ears, resulting in her stabbing herself in the face. She attacked Shing even though the rules say not to attack an Ashikabi. Her name means \"Ash feather\" and her attacks are Zankako no Tsume (Talons of Execution) and Seikei no Tsume (Claws of Execution).",
