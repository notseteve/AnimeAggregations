  "description" : "One of http://anidb.net/ch35304 [Silvie]`s colleagues and the champion Valkyrie pilot in the Solar System. He appears to be a bit narcissistic, probably as a result of variable fighter pilots in Earth society being bestowed treatment similar to that received by pop idols, and is the epitome of stereotypical \"manliness\". Although he doesn`t seem to go very far with http://anidb.net/ch35304 [Silvie] beyond a few dates, he is genuinely in love with her. He pilots a combat-worthy prototype of the http://anidb.net/ch49181 [VA-1SS Metal Siren] variable fighter during the U.N. Spacy`s fleet engagement against Marduk near the Moon and is given command of one of the two http://anidb.net/ch49178 [Macross Cannons] committed to resist the final Marduk assault on Earth.\nSource: wiki",
