  "description" : "Trevor`s Charizard is the evolved form of Trevor`s Charmeleon. It evolved sometime before the first match of the Kalos league. Trevor`s trump card was that his Charizard can mega evolve and he had been working hard before the Kalos league to prepare. Trevor`s Charizard`s ability is Drought which greatly increases the power of Fire type moves. It was defeated in the first round of the Kalos league by Alain`s Charizard when it fired a Flamethrower up in the sky.",
