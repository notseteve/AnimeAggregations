  "description" : "Takehito Asama is Miya`s late husband who was friends with Seo. A researcher of the MBI, he was the discoverer of the winging system, Norito, and the existence of the Ashikabi. Together with Takami, he was the adjuster of the \"First Generation\" Disciplinary Squad, consisting of Miya, Matsu, Kazehana, Karasuba, and Mutsu. He once confessed to Homura that he believed an Ashikabi`s power is the power of fate. He was against Hiroto`s idea of the \"Sekirei Plan\". He also designed the Izumo Inn, which he helped Seo build. It is implied by Miya that his death may have something to do with her leaving the MBI. Takehito was the first to use a \"Demonic Visage\" while talking to Seo over the phone and, after using the visage, it made Miya smile for the first time.",
