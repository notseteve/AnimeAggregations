  "description" : "The original Trowa Barton was the spoiled son of Dekim, used to getting anything he wanted. Originally scheduled to be the pilot of the Heavyarms, he was furious when he learned that Doktor S and the other engineers didn`t agree with Operation Meteor. As he prepared to tell his father of their \"betrayal\", Trowa was shot in the back by a mechanic who feared for his family`s safety on Earth, and died. At that point, a nameless engineer offered to take over for the dead man, and the new Trowa Barton was born. It is known that the original Trowa was apparently willing to tell No-Name about his sister`s daughter, Mariemaia, and how she would be ruling the world after Operation Meteor, but this appears mainly to have been boasting rather than true friendship or closeness. If Mariemaia is truly Treize Khushrenada`s daughter with Leia Barton, it can be assumed that the real Trowa Barton is Mariemaia`s uncle by blood.",
