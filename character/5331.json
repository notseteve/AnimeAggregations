  "description" : "Chiaia is Lashara`s personal escort and bodyguard, charged with protecting her life at all costs. She also attends Holy Land Academy to complete her Seikishi training, and officially becomes a Seikishi at the end of episode 2. She is very skilled at combat, being able to imitate Kenshi`s unusual Seikijin fighting style after only seeing it once. She has a crush on Dagmyer, which causes her to ignore clues regarding his schemes until it`s too late. She frequently gets upset with both Kenshi (due to his cluelessness) and Lashara (due to her seemingly-reckless schemes), and Chiaia`s temper is one of the few things that Lashara seems to be wary of. While not happy about it, she agrees to go along with Lashara`s scheme to hide the fact that Kenshi is the Seikijin pilot that tried to kill her. Her Seikijin is pink and red with a fox-like tail equipped with a longsword. She realizes she might have feelings for Kenshi when she sees he is wearing the pendant with the red thread she made.\nSource: Wiki",
