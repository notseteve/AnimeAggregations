  "description" : "Okuro is an Ainu warrior whose village was struck by an epidemic and torched by the Matsumae clan Han. Overcome with rage, he killed the official who authorized the burning. He was arrested and incarcerated, but escaped before he could be executed.\nHis weapon is unique, a modified crossbow, called a Chu-Ko-Nu, that can repeatedly fire bolts. He mistakes http://anidb.net/ch4865 [Mugen] as part of the Matsumae Han (who, ironically, later mistake Mugen for Okuru) and attacks him. He withdraws after he realizes the error. Later, he saves http://anidb.net/ch4863 [Fuu] after she plunges off a crag. Upon encountering Mugen again, they do battle, and Mugen remarks that he has the \"eyes of a dead man, like a severed head that doesn`t know it`s been cut off.\"\nTheir fight is interrupted by agents of the Matsumae Han, led by http://anidb.net/ch89569 [Tobata]. Okuru is riddled by flaming arrows, but miraculously remains standing. Jin and Mugen slaughter the rest of the Matsumae Han agents, while Okuru wrenches an arrow out of his gut and stabs Tobata dead with it. Engulfed in flames, he leaps off a cliff into the river below. Mugen believes that Okuru is still alive.\nSource: Wikipedia",
