  "description" : "The Commander of the A.E.G.I.S. Far-East Branch oversees the operations and deployments of Japan`s Gate Keepers. He was an Ensign in the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II, and was supposed to fly an Ohka piloted bomb on a suicide mission in 1945, near the end of World War II. However, his mothership was shot down, and ironically, he was the sole survivor. When he attempted to commit suicide with a pistol after being rescued by the US Navy, he was restrained by a sailor who told him two words: \"Stay alive.\" This changed his life and after the war he was one of the first members of the Police Reserve (later the Japan Self Defense Force). In the PlayStation Gate Keepers RPG and the Gate Keepers 1985 novel, it is revealed that the Commander`s name is Tetsuya Tokiwatari (時渡 哲也, Tokiwatari Tetsuya?) and he has the Gate of Time and Space.",
