  "description" : "Martin Bufholtz was an Imperial university student on Odin who was a childhood friend of Siegfried Kircheis. He studied classical literature, and was afraid of being drafted into the military. His application for exemption had been refused as exemptions were realistically only granted to students in fields considered \"useful\" by the Ministry of Military Affairs, such as medicine or engineering. Bufholtz was arrested around December 794 UC for being part of an underground anti-war organization by the Imperial Military Police and died of malnutrition in prison within 2 years.\nSource: Gineipedia",
