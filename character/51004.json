  "description" : "Virgil`s Umbreon is the evolved form of Virgil`s Eevee. While Virgil was about Ash`s age, he went out to explore the forest with the first Eievui he had befriended. Getting carried away, he walked in too far. Not only had he become lost in the forest, but the sun had also set; just when he thought all hope was lost, his Eievui evolved into Blacky. Thanks to Virgil`s Umbreon, Virgil got out of the forest and a special bond between him and Eievui was born.\nNone of its moves as an Eevee are known.",
