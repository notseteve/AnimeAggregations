  "description" : "Kakuna, known as the Cocoon Pokémon, are pupal Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions, of which its larval form is the worm-like Weedle. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Kakuna are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species acquired by players, either by catching one in the wild or training a Weedle past experience level 7 and evolving it into a Kakuna. They can evolve into the hornet-like Beedrill when raised past experience level 10. Within the shell, a Kakuna busily prepares itself for evolution into its adult form, and the amount of energy released by this process makes the shell quite hot to the touch. In the wild, Kakuna are often found near or on trees, and because their range of motion is extremely limited, they may be mistaken for dead. Carelessly approaching a Kakuna in this state would be extremely unwise because it can still extend the barb of its poisonous stinger to protect itself from threats.",
