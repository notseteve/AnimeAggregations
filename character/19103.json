  "description" : "Hauenkua serves under Kuuya Amururineuruka and has roughly the same status as Hien. He pilots a red Avu-Kamuu, with customized claws on each arm. He is entertained by war and suffering and has a somewhat psychopathic personality, however this all drains away when he feels his mortality (such as when Witsuarunemitea destroyed his Avu-Kamuu), leaving him a panic wreck. He was later killed when Witsuarunemitea pounded his Avu-Kamuu into a mess.",
