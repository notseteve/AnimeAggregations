  "description" : "An agent of Section 2 and Angelica`s handler, Marco Toni suffered an injury to his left eye, which resulted in his suspension from the Criminal Police Central Directorate (DCPP) of the Polizia di Stato. His friend, Dr. Bianchi, recommended Marco to serve as Angelica`s handler. To help Angelica adjust to her new surroundings and all the surgeries, he created a fairy tale titled Il Principe del Regno della Pasta (\"The Prince of the Land of Pasta\") about a prince who ate only pasta. This fascinated his girlfriend at the time, Patricia, who later wrote and published an actual book based on the story. The conditioning process changed Angelica`s personality and effectiveness and her memories could become random: she would remember some events and forget others. This caused Marco to no longer feel any attachment her, though after her death he felt regret over how he treated her and promised that if ever paired with a new cyborg, he would treat her better than he did Angelica.\nSource: Wikipedia",
