  "description" : "Buyo is Kagome`s really fat cat. Of the times I`ve seen him, he was either sleeping or being played with by InuYasha. Almost every time InuYasha comes to Kagome`s time, he`ll be seen playing around with Buyo (not that Buyo likes it).\nBuyo is pretty much the key turning point of the whole series. If it weren`t for Buyo, Kagome would probaby be dating Hojo and never met InuYasha or the rest of them. InuYasha would still be sealed to the tree, and Miroku would be trying to get Naraku by himself.\nIf Buyo hadn`t run into the shrine and Kagome didn`t go after him, there`d be no story. Buyo made the series.",
