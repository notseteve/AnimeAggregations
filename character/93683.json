  "description" : "Eru works at Tsuiki base in Fukuoka Prefecture as a dragon pilot. She is cool and dignified, very good at both academics and sports. El believes that she should be the ace among other pilots. But in fact her depth of understanding of OTF(dragons) is very low and her co-workers find it difficult to deal with her. She pilots a dragon disguising F-2A fighter aircraft.\nSource: Official page",
