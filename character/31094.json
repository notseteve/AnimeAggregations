  "description" : "An awkward boy with slightly unkempt reddish-brown hair, who usually walks around with a music player and red/orange headphones around his neck. He dual wields blades ranging from blunt wrenches to knives to daggers in battle. He is usually very clumsy and often used as comic relief through physical comedy. When going from place to place, he is usually on his bike. Yousuke is the most vocal of the investigation team, and is the one often to create theories on the murders as well as piece evidence together. Although it often falls on the player to decipher the clues Yousuke ponders, his deductive skills allow him to create solid theories, and he is the self-appointed second in command, often saying what the player is unable to.\nHis Persona is Jiraiya of The Magician Arcana, whose head vaguely resembles that of a cartoon frog, and wears a white disco suit with a distinctive \"V\" on its chest along with a red scarf. Jiraiya uses wind spells and is also able to use minor healing spells. Once his Social Link, The Magician Arcana, is maxed out, Jiraiya will evolve into Susanoo.\nYousuke`s Shadow takes the form of a cartoon frog with a body on top; the body and frog resemble his Persona. It represents his resentment of living in a small country town with little to do, as well as his inner wish for something exciting to happen.",
