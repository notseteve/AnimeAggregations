  "description" : "Minamo is Seina`s little sister and also inherited no powers from the Jinguji blood within her. She is physically very weak, though this is hidden by her constantly playing pranks and general acts of mischief (this has included making a mess of the school dorms and throwing Nanaho`s foreign-imported teddy bear into pouring rain). She likes doing scripts and drawings and was the one behind projects such as the Best Student Council card game featuring the members of the student council and the (poorly received) play Space Alien. Even though Minamo has a weak heart, she doesn`t want others to feel pity for her, causing her to constantly push herself despite the danger to her health.",
