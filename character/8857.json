  "description" : "Toji is the boy that Momo has had a crush on ever since middle school. He is pretty shy around girls, which is one reason that he and Momo didn`t get together. He also seems to lack a certain amount of common sense and can be very gullible. However, he loves Momo more than he can say, and is more than willing to make painful sacrifices in their relationship to keep Momo from being humiliated and tormented by the evil plots of Sae.",
