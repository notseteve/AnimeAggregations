  "description" : "Siam is an ex-mercenary who mentored both http://anidb.net/ch8969 [Canaan] and http://anidb.net/ch8970 [Alphard]. He rescued the young Canaan from the ruins of her home village, took her under his care, and trained her in the art of combat. Once, Alphard, Siam and Canaan were hired to hijack an armored military train to steal the Ua virus it was carrying. He was shot by Alphard, who revealed that their client had ordered her to kill all witnesses on the train; this included him and Canaan. Alphard left him to die while a bomb was placed to blow up the train. However, Siam ordered Canaan to stop Alphard from escaping with the Ua virus. He disarmed the bomb before bleeding to death. This event is the main reason of contention between Canaan and Alphard. Even though he is dead, his \"spirit\" appears to both Canaan and Alphard.\nSource: Wikipedia",
