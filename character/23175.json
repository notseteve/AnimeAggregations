  "description" : "The mysterious vessel that serves as Phantom Pain`s mothership during the attack on Armory One. The Girty Lue is equipped with a Mirage Colloid system that enables it to turn invisible, a technology which was supposedly outlawed by the Junius Treaty that ended the previous war, and although its design and armament resemble those of Earth Alliance warships this vessel appears to operate outside the bounds of the regular military. In addition to its Mirage Colloid capabilities, the Girty Lue can also be equipped with a stealth system that propels the ship with jets of gas in order to avoid detection by thermal sensors.",
