  "description" : "Benzaiten is the Japanese name for the Hindu goddess http://anidb.net/ch40680 [Saraswati], god of wealth, music, eloquence and water.\nWorship of Benzaiten arrived in Japan during the 6th through 8th centuries, mainly via the Chinese translations of the Sutra of Golden Light, which has a section devoted to her. She is also mentioned in the Lotus Sutra and often depicted holding a biwa, a traditional Japanese lute, in contrast to Saraswati who holds a stringed instrument known as a veena. Benzaiten is a highly syncretic entity with both a Buddhist and a Shinto side.\nIn http://anidb.net/a8 [Aquarian Age], becoming Benzaiten (and thus the leader of the http://anidb.net/ch40598 [Arayashiki] faction) is one of two possible fates of http://anidb.net/ch5896 [Sannou Yoriko].",
