  "description" : "During the 7th Space War, the United Nations Earth developed and deployed three advanced new mobile suit designs to counter the Space Revolutionary Army. One of these new units was the GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster, and like its brethren GX-9900 Gundam X and GT-9600 Gundam Leopard, it was equipped with a \"flash system\", enabling a Newtype pilot to mentally remote-control a large number of bit mobile suits (or \"mobile bits\") - in the Airmaster`s case, the FW-9800 GW-Bit. The Airmaster was also unique in that it was one of the first mobile suits to be equipped with the \"TransSystem\", a design concept which enabled the Airmaster to transform into a fighter-like craft capable of atmospheric flight. Although only lightly armed with vulcan guns and a pair of \"buster\" beam rifles, the Airmaster was quite nimble as an aerial combat unit.\nAlthough an unknown number of Airmasters were manufactured, only one unit is known to have survived the war. This last remaining Airmaster would find its way into the hands of Vulture mercenary pilot Witz Sou, who operated this transforming Gundam during the military chaos occuring in A.W. 0015. While fighting the New UNE in the Asian nation of Estard, it became apparent that the Airmaster`s aging design was not performing well against new designs such as the NRMA-006 Gadeel mobile armor. After being damaged in battle, the Estard government offered its resources and upgraded the unit to the GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst.",
