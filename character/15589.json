  "description" : "In the Anime, Lin did not appear until the Sweeper Alliance, and his role was different: He merely summoned the sweepers and granted them a place in the trip to Clarken Island instantaneously. He also attempted to persuade Train into rejoining Chronos once his identity had been revealed, a scene which occurred in the anime (Ep 17). He also shows a \"darker\" personality in the Anime, as in the manga he was an innocent Number who admired Train and just wanted to fight for world peace, but in the Anime his admiring for Train is more directed to \"admiring his power\", and he has no problems in offending the sweepers many times. He also accuses them of fighting without receiving nothing in return, which makes him sound a bit materialistic. But it seems his personality evolves as he shows a more sympathic side, which appears to start when he says, precisely, that sweepers are idiots for fighting without getting anything in return, but after a chat with Train, when they`re helping townsfolk, Train asks him if he isn`t one of those fools, and he answers smiling \"You might be right\".",
