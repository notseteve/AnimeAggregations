  "description" : "Youshou fled Jurai over 700 years ago to \"retire\" on Earth. He was once the greatest swordsman on Jurai. Youshou had a marriage arranged with half-sister Aeka, but left. At the time, not all Juraians liked the idea of mixed blood heritages (he is part human, on his mother`s side) and he used Ryouko`s attack as an excuse to slip away to Earth.",
