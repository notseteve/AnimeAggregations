  "description" : "Quaxly is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IX.\nIt evolves into Quaxwell starting at level 16, which evolves into Quaquaval starting at level 36.\nAlong with Sprigatito and Fuecoco, Quaxly is one of three starter Pokémon of Paldea available at the beginning of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. They were also the first Generation IX Pokémon to be revealed to the public on February 27, 2022, through a Pokémon Presents video presentation.\nQuaxly is a white duckling-like Pokémon. It has a yellow beak and blue eyes. It has teal webbed feet and a large teal coif-like crest that covers its head, with a feathery tuft in the front and a white curvy line shaped like a wave. Quaxly`s coif has a smooth feel thanks to the rich, moist cream that holds it. The coif can become unkempt should it get dry.\nQuaxly is an earnest and tidy Pokémon, and tends to overthink things. Quaxly`s feathers secrete a glossy gel which protects its body against water and grime. It hates getting itself dirty, especially on its head. Quaxly`s strong legs allow it to swim without issues, even in strong currents. It also uses its legs to repeatedly kick its foes with swift speed. Although found in Paldea, Quaxly is not native to the region, instead having migrated from faraway places a long time ago.",
