  "description" : "Tsuda Takatoshi is the main character of the story, he chooses to attend a former all-girl school simply because it is close to his home. On his first day at the school, he is forcibly recruited into the student council as the vice president and male representative. He normally acts as the straight-man to Shino and Aria, who, along with other girls in the school, regularly make perverted comments and sexual innuendos; he becomes so used to it that he would actually feel odd if they did not make such jokes.\nSource: Wiki",
