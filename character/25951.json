  "description" : "The First of the Knights of Fianna, Lancer possesses a love spot on his face, which causes females with insufficient magic resistance to fall in love with him should they gaze upon it. As a knight, he holds a strong sense of honour in battle and loyalty to his master. Despite being enemies, he and Saber share mutual respect for each other. Lancer possesses two Noble Phantasms: Gae Buidhe: The Golden Rose of Mortality, a short yellow spear which inflicts wounds that do not heal as long as the spear exists in the world, and Gae Dearg: The Crimson Rose of Exorcism, a long red spear which cancels mana upon contact, ignoring all magical defences and temporarily dispelling all magical attributes of the target struck.\nSource: Wikipedia",
