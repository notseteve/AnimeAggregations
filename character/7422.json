  "description" : "Leader of the Spider Riders and prince of Arachna. He is rather lazy for a ruler, preferring diplomatic solutions over fights, even against the Invectid. Some say it is because his spider, Ebony, is so powerful that he is afraid to let it loose. He would much rather negotiate with the enemy, and only fight when absolutely needed. Lumen is bright, loquacious, and loves cute girls. Ebony, his spider, also loves to talk and always advises Lumen on how to rule Arachna, his battle technique, and on dating! His weapon is a sword.",
