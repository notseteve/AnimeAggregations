  "description" : "The middle child of the Tezuka family, Nagisa has been ignored a little too long. She is, in a word, psychotic.\nA beautiful woman with wavy black hair and blue eyes, Nagisa dresses and behaves like a rich gangster. She even employs nameless henchmen, dresses them in in black suits and sunglasses, and drives around in a Mercedes.\nNagisa is consumed by the desire for revenge on Shinobu for injustices perpetrated on her as a child. Unfortunately, this revenge seems to inconvenience Shinobu`s friends far more than it does him.",
