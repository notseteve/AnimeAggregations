Built to be operated by two, Welkin mans the guns and issues commands to Isara, in control of both the wheel and wireless radio.\nDespite its age, it was among the first to use angled plating and other emergent concepts, yielding high performance from an early test age. Its high cost was all that precluded its mass production.",
