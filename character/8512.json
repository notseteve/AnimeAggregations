At this time, he became one of her chevaliers, after which he wears only white clothing as a symbol of his being Diva`s chevalier because it was what he was wearing when he met her. At the time, he wanted to free himself from seeing humans kill each other, but afterwards, he started seeing humans as insignificant and beneath him. As time passed, he realized the world of the chiropterans are just as full of war as the human one.",
