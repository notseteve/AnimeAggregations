  "description" : "A group in class F who once punished Akihisa for getting attention from the girls, to the extent of `sentencing him to death`. They also seem to be Hideyoshi`s fans. When agitated, like when they learned of Class B`s representative having a girlfriend, they would turn into \"Messengers of Genocide\", using their Shoukanjuu as sacrifice, suicide-bombing their opponents effectively.",
