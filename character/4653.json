  "description" : "Zankan is a brilliant mechanic that lives out in the desert with his daughter, Millie. Mankind is not allowed to possess advanced technology, thanks to The Third and their law, the \"Technos Taboo\" - but that hasn`t stopped Zankan. His living outside of town and ignoring the technology laws has allowed him to hone his craft to its utmost potential. He`s a kind man who, for years, has been both a mechanic and a friend to Honoka.",
