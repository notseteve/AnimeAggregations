  "description" : "Blond and grey-eyed, Kazuhiro resembles Mitsuru more than he does his younger brother, Kazuya.\nOrphaned while still in high school, Kazuhiro was forced to raise Kazuya by himself. At the time, he took this responsibility very seriously, but now that Kazuya is grown, Hiro has allowed himself to return to his former easy-going personality (much to his brother`s chagrin).\nTo add insult to injury, Hiro has married Kazuya`s first love, Sumire-chan. He also takes perverse pleasure in teasing the heck out of his brother because \"His reactions are so cute!\".\nKazuhiro works at Ryokuto Academy as the school nurse. As such he has to deal with the disappointment of the various boys who come through the infirmary expecting a female nurse.\nKazuhiro also graduated from Ryokuto Academy. He has a fairly friendly relationship with Mitsuru and Shinobu which dates back to their first year. (Both of them wound up unconscious in the infirmary within the first four weeks of their arrival! Not at the same time, though).\nAlthough Hiro gives Kazuya a hard time, he really does love his brother.",
