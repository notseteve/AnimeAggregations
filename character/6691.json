  "description" : "This machine is the culmination of the AEUG`s secret \"Zeta Project,\" whose goal was to create a transformable mobile suit capable of operating in every environment from weightless space to Earth`s gravity. By transforming into a streamlined Wave Rider form, the Zeta Gundam can ride the shockwaves of atmospheric re-entry and then cruise through Earth`s atmosphere. As a mobile suit, it combines the movable frame technology of the Gundam Mk.II with the lightweight Gundarium Gamma alloy of the Rick Dias, not to mention an extraordinary level of firepower. In the hands of the young Newtype pilot Kamille Bidan, one of its principal designers, the Zeta Gundam proves to be the most powerful weapon in the rebels` arsenal.",
