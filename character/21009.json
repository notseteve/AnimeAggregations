  "description" : "Orifushi Natsumi is the eldest sister of the Orifushi household. She became the manager of Min-Min Ice Cream after the death of her parents. Natsumi is calm and kind, she speaks gently and politely, and she is beautiful and has large breasts. She is very weak to alcohol, becoming tipsy after merely smelling it; in the event she does drink, she becomes aggressive and frenzied. Natsumi loves fortune-telling, and frequently checks her own and others` fortune, often using strange methods, but what`s stranger still is the fact that the results tend to be quite accurate.\nSource: VNDB",
