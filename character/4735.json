  "description" : "The leader of B.A.B.E.L. He dotes on \"The Children\" all the time and spoils them rotten not realising that this overindulgence is probably the reason for the bad behaviour of \"The Children\". Taizou can and does point to Minamoto as the scapegoat for The Children`s fallibilities and poor attitudes. Whether Taizou overindulges \"The Children\" because he really loves them or because he is frightened for his job/personal safety remains to be seen; still, Taizou is extremely attached to Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi (who are starting to realize that Taizou`s intense affection for them is not entirely altruistic) and goes into a frenzy comparable to a Level 6 esper whenever he feels that \"The Children\" are in distress.",
