  "description" : "In ancient times, a peaceful island in the Decolora Archipelago was suddenly attacked by a group of Pokémon. A man named Woodate arrived on the island from across the ocean. To save the people who were exhausted from the Pokémon`s assaults, Woodate skillfully led the Pokémon to the summit of the mountain. And then, when he held up his hand to the night sky upon his arrival at the summit, A comet emitting dazzling light appeared, illuminating the earth. It was as if Woodate had predicted the appearance of the comet; the Pokémon became rooted to the spot, calmed their rage and submitted to him. And so, peace returned to the island.\nAfterwards, Woodate remained on the island with the Pokémon and Trainers who heard of him gathered from all regions to challenge him. On the battlefield built on the summit of the mountain, Woodate displayed excellent battles and didn`t lose even once, it`s said.\nThe people of the island called him a hero and called the comet that appears every 10-odd years the \"Woodate Comet\" to praise his achievements.",
