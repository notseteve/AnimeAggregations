  "description" : "Shirayuki loves to cook, especially for her brother, and is always trying out new recipes for him. She refers to herself in the third-person as \"Hime\" (姫?), which translates to \"princess\". This might be because of her name`s Western variant: Snow White. She also frequently ends her sentences with the phrase \"desu-no.\" She addresses her brother as Nii-sama (にいさま?), which is shorter than Sakuya`s, but polite. Her birthday is February 11, is an Aquarian, and stands 140 cm (about 4` 7\") in height.",
