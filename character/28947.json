  "description" : "Yuuji`s younger sister. Kazuki described her as being a crybaby when she was younger. Now that she has grown up she isn`t quite the crybaby she used to be. Now she can be found pelting her older brother with air guns hidden in her teddy bear Seiyuu and her other puppets when her brother is acting vulgar. Though she shoots him without a moments hesitation, she does greatly care for her older brother and gets lonely without him suggesting she might have a brother complex, with stronger hints later as she becomes jealous of Yuuju`s and Kazuki`s growing relationship. Marie is mortally afraid of cats and insects. She is able to flee bugs yet is nearly paralyzed by the presence of cats, though they are drawn to her.",
