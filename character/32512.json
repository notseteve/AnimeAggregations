  "description" : "Pierrot is the first Level 2 Akuma to appear that originally appeared as a Level 1 in Mater, where it attempted to steal the http://anidb.net/ch32510 [Ghost of Mater]`s Innocence.\nOnce it had evolved into a Level 2, Pierrot gained the ability to physicially mimic other living beings and even inanimate objects like sand. He called this ability a Paper Mirror, as he was also able to take off his skin and superimpose it onto others to disguise them however he wanted. Pierrot`s ability, however, had shortcomings: all of his copies were exact mirror images, and despite being able to copy http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen]`s Cross, he could not copy its strength.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
