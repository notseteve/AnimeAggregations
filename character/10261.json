  "description" : "Tomohane is the youngest of the pack of Inukami that has contracted with http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]. She has the special ability to track the path of otherworldly entities and apparently has some skill with chemistry. As the youngest and weakest member of her pack, Tomohane fears that she will hold her allies back and so she tries very hard to keep up with the rest of the Inukami. After an adventure involving http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] and a minor spirit-creature - a mujina - which she later adopted as a pet and named http://anidb.net/ch10276 [Maro], Tomohane was the second of Kaoru`s Inukami to recognize Keita`s good side.",
