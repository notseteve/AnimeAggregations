  "description" : "Makora, whose real name was Fuuma Kotarou, is the childhood friend of Sasuke. He sought revenge against Sasuke because he was almost killed by him. In truth, however, Kotarou was temporarily controlled by the real Indara who caused him to attack Sasuke. Sasuke defended himself, but all Kotarou remembered was Sasuke attacking him. Makora has the ability to control shadow forces and hide under them. His attack, Kageochi, makes an opponent drown in his own shadow. Nevertheless, he was finally defeated by Sasuke after realizing that Sasuke did not want to kill him. They made a pact of becoming good friends when they were still living in Aokigahara. Once he learned the truth, Kotarou protected Sasuke from Indara`s attack which ultimately killed him.\nIn the anime, Makora lives and joins Sanada Yukimura and Sasuke`s forces in their fight against Benitora and his forces.",
