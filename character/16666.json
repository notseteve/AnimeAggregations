He is strong and have great boxing technique which he used to take on all the six new comers when Mario instigated a fight.\nAlthough it seemed he looked down upon the six new cell mates in the beginning, which lead to a fight he won with ease, the six new cell mates found out later that Sakuragi is in reality a guy worthy to look upon and soon start to refer him as An-chan, which can be translated as an `intimate bro`.\nThe reason why Sakuragi has been detained is unknown. It seems Sakuragi holds the key to lead the six new comers to the outside world when they end their detention in two years time.",
