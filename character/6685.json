  "description" : "This 2000-metre-long transport ship is part of the Jupiter Fleet, whose vessels voyage out to the gas giant Jupiter to collect helium-3 fuel for the Earth Sphere`s fusion reactors. The Jupitris is propelled by a set of thermonuclear pulse engines, and equipped with a rotating ring which provides its crew with artificial gravity. This massive ship serves as Paptimus Scirocco`s home base; after he joins forces with the Titans he has the Jupitris parked in Earth orbit, and he returns here periodically to plan his schemes and work on his menagerie of handmade mobile suits.",
