  "description" : "Yuko is a biologist and a school teacher teaching science at a local high school who been constantly attempting to escape from Taki, her abusive ex-lover and a gym teacher at the school she works at. After seeking comfort from her best friend Ayano when Taki had sexually assaulted her at work, she is introduced to a research project involving an ancient foreign scroll, a dagger, and a box containing a smelly decayed penis that had been decapitated from a Lust Demon that many people had greatly feared millions of years ago. The dagger that the ladies are also studying on was used to exterminate the demon that the mummified body part came from. One day, Taki attacks Yuko again and rapes her using the demon`s amputated penis; following the aftermath, Yuko starts to go through some changes both physically and mentally.\nAs she`s under possession of the Lust Demon, she seduces and kills numerous people-(most often men) including Taki and Koji-(one of Yuko`s students) by sucking out their life forces as a form of nourishment, thus killing them. While out on her killing sprees/sexual escapades, she attempts to find a virgin woman to impregnate and bear her child that she will give birth to. When more similar incidents related to those events are informed, Ayano along with help from her younger sister Reika and her classmate Naoto start investigating and doing research about the Lust Demon, in order to destroy the demon once and for all and save Yuko from it`s control.",
