  "description" : "The local deity, called Yana (written with the kanji for Life twice), has two lives. One of them is sealed in the local shrine as a living god. In fact, it`s sealed in the body of the shrine maiden, who was born with. The second Yana was using a buck as a vessel.\nThe buck has been slain by Ao, who is now a vessel to him. The seal of Yana on his left upper arm is proof of that.\nLater Murasame eats the spirit, making Shino bear the seal.\nYana takes form as a huge two-headed dragon when whole. It`s original duty was to grant the wish of its vessel. Instead over the years the vessel has become the fullfiller of wishes for the villagers.\nAfter becoming whole again and fullfilling its original duty, Yana was bound to vanish, instead it was able to live on in Ao, requested by Shino.",
