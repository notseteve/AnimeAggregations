  "description" : "The hidden form of the Gundam Virtue. This Gundam is revealed when the Virtue discards its armour, and is distinguished by the long red cords on its head that supply GN particles to the armour parts. The Nadleeh retains the GN Beam Sabers stored inside the knee armour of the Virtue, and it can use the Virtue`s GN Cannons as handheld weapons, but a special GN Beam Rifle and GN Shield have also been prepared for its use. Its pilot Tieria Erde is forced to reveal the Nadleeh ahead of schedule, and it possesses secret capabilities that have yet to be demonstrated.",
