  "description" : "Black Star is a descendant of the Star Ninja Clan, a clan that was notorious for doing anything for money. This caused the ninja to be hated and feared in many places. Due to their actions the entire clan was exterminated by Shibusen thirteen years ago. Black Star, who was just a baby then, was taken in by Shibusen. Even though his parents and family were killed, Black Star bears no grudge over this. He accepts his parents` death because of the evil life they lived. The star tattoo on Black Star`s right shoulder sometimes causes him trouble, as it marks him as a Star Clan ninja who are still hated and feared to this day in some villages.",
