  "description" : "Quilava is the evolution of Cyndaquil. Quilava have long, thin bodies with small forepaws and slightly longer hindpaws, similar to real-life weasels. Their tan fur is slightly darker than Cyndaquil`s, while the blue streak has been lowered to cover their eyes. As per the family line, Quilava sport short, coarse fireproof fur and have special vents on their heads and lower backs. Though they do not have a tail, the lower vents are positioned as to give the illusion of one.\nQuilava are noted in the Pok√©dex to turn their backs toward their opponents in battle as a sign that they are about to use their flame-based abilities in battle, or to intimidate foes by demonstrating their power. Quilava are noted for their speed, and can nimbly evade attacks while scorching their enemies. They can also create gusts of superheated air, albeit to the same effect.",
