  "description" : "Sarutobi Asuma is the son of the http://anidb.net/ch8865 [Third Hokage] and uncle to http://anidb.net/ch10931 [Konohamaru]. He is a jounin shinobi who leads http://anidb.net/ch8615 [Shikamaru], http://anidb.net/ch8617 [Chouji] and http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Ino] in Team Asuma. Asuma is generally quite laid back and gets on well with all of his students, but spends a lot of time with Shikamaru in particular; the pair often plays shogi together, though Asuma has never beaten him in a game. In battle Asuma tends to use a combination of taijutsu and chakra infused blades.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
