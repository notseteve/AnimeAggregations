  "description" : "Mijuka was introduced by Freddy to the crowd of the Scallsword King Playoff`s on Scallsword Island as the winner of the girls` competition and was designated the Queen for a year. Ash`s Oshawott instantly fell in love and gave her a bunch of red roses which she dismissed away. Undeterred, Ash`s Oshawott competed in the playoff and ended up winning the competition. Realizing that she wouldn`t be with Quattro`s Dewott, Mijuka jumped off the stage to be with him. This caused Ash`s Oshawott Scallsword to break and according to the rules of the tournament, it was stripped of the title of king and Quattro`s Dewott became the king.",
