  "description" : "The Braw Bro is one of Zeon`s first Newtype mobile armors, equipped with the mind-machine interface known as the psycommu system. Its wire-guided mega particle cannon ordinarily require individual gunners, but Newtype pilot Challia Bull is able to coordinate all four turrets to attack his target from multiple directions. The Braw Bro`s main body can break apart into three sections, including an escape capsule for the pilots.",
