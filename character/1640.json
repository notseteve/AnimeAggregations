  "description" : "The three brothers are the owners of the largest bakery chain in France. Aside from Solar Hands (which all top bakers in France must have), they also have extreme nimble fingers of goddess hands (which Azuma and Suwabara also possess). Gran Kaiser is also unique, in that his father also trained him such that his arms are abnormally large and strong, powerful enough to support the weight of him and his brothers. They are always hidden under a bird-like mask.",
