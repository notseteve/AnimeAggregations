Although Raku has a major crush on her, she does not reveal that she has a similar crush on him. When Raku mentions his lost locket of his first love, she shows some interest as she secretly carries a potential key, however, when confronted about the key or being the first love, she lies and denies it in embarrassment. Although she works with her mother at a dessert shop, she turns out to be a terrible cook on her own. Surprisingly, whatever food she fashions looks good on the outside.\nSource: Wiki",
