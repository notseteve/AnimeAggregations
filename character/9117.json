  "description" : "Sakura`s wandering monk uncle. Cherry`s real name is Sakuranbou, which literally means \"cherry\" in Japanese. But because the word`s kanji can be read to mean \"deranged monk\", a phrase that is quite accurate in describing him, he prefers to be called by the English word. Cherry has amazing spiritual powers (or so he claims) and he often predicts doom for Ataru (no great feat). He has a habit of popping up out of nowhere, often from very strange places. His ugly face and very short stature are frequently used for comedic effect. Cherry has made a vow of asceticism, living in a tent in an empty lot not far from Ataru`s house. However, this vow apparently doesn`t apply to food, as he is an enormous mooch. Rei Hino of Sailor Moon`s Grandpa looks a lot like Cherry.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
