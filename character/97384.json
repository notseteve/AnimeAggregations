  "description" : "Ottofried III was the 31st kaiser of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire].\nAs Crown Prince, Ottofried III was very popular, and it was assumed he would make a very capable Kaiser. Ottofried III was known to have simultaneously occupied all 3 military joint chiefs of staff positions when he was Crown Prince. He also held the position of Prime Minister as Crown Prince. After his coronation, the position of Prime Minister was permanently left vacant and taboo in all subsequent reigns (until being filled by http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]), and its responsibilities taken up by the Minister of State. This was to prevent any subject from following the same path or filling the same position as a Kaiser. Unfortunately, after Ottofried III assumed the throne, a number of conspiracies against the Empire occurred. Most of these conspiracies failed, but they led Kaiser Ottofried III to become extremely paranoid. So fearful was he of assassination, he married 4 different women as Kaiserin and changed his designated heir 5 times. It is unknown what happened to his wives after they were divorced, or his sons after they were disowned. It is likely they were either exiled, imprisoned or executed. Kaiser Ottofried III died a lingering death, hardly consuming any food, for fear it might have been poisoned.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
