  "description" : "Ash`s Froakie contacted Professor Sycamore laboratory to let them know he wanted to give up Froakie. The staff at the lab had been worried about Froakie.\nThis particular Froakie is a bit different to the other ones the professor had given out. It refused to listen to its trainers during battle, it ran away from a trainer simply because it didn`t like its trainer and several trainers have returned it to Professor Sycamore lab.\nFroakie though took a liking to Ash and it came to the rescue when Team Rocket was trying to steal Pikachu. It also accompanied Ash up the Prism Tower when they went after Garchomp. Finally, as Ash was leaving the lab, Froakie appeared with its Pok√© Ball, indicating that it wanted to travel with him. Ash agreed and he caught Froakie.",
