  "description" : "A high-performance mobile suit developed in the early days of the war as a replacement for the GINN. The CGUE has higher mobility than its predecessor and is equipped with new and improved weapons, including a built-in vulcan cannon in the shield on its left arm. However, the CGUE never reached the mass production stage, and the few units that were produced have been assigned to commanders like Rau Le Creuset.",
