  "description" : "Ayumu \"Osaka\" Kasuga, commonly known as Osaka, is a transfer student from Osaka. Tomo, expecting her to act like the stereotypical Osakan (loud, exuberant and fond of bawdy jokes), quickly chose for her the nickname \"Osaka\", although Ayumu`s behavior could not be more different from the \"typical\" Osakan. Ayumu considers her label \"too simple\" and \"icky,\" but she lacks the energy or motivation to dispute it. Unlike the stereotypical Osakan, she seems slow and easily distracted, but she merely has a mind that works quite differently than most people. This makes her prone to daydreaming, absentmindedness, and non-sequiturs, but it also makes her unusually good at answering very specific types of riddles. She is also easily amused by things that most people would consider bizarre.",
