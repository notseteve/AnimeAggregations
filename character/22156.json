  "description" : "The Mobile suit Embedded Tactical EnfORcer, or METEOR, is an armed module designed to support the http://anidb.net/ch1489 [Freedom Gundam] and http://anidb.net/ch22155 [Justice Gundam]. These METEOR units serve as gun turrets while attached to the hull of the warship http://anidb.net/ch22193 [Eternal], and when detached they can dock with a Gundam and draw energy from its nuclear engine. The METEOR is equipped with powerful thrusters for high-speed flight, and its beam cannons, missile launchers, and beam swords give it the firepower of a space warship. Since the Freedom and Justice have the ability to lock onto multiple targets, they can use the METEOR`s battery of long-range weapons to intercept dozens of enemies simultaneously.",
