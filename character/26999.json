  "description" : "Siegfried was the Fifth Fist of Ragnarok. He is called The Immortal Composer because he composes music, using his battles as inspiration for his melodies. He has a tendency to hum or sing classical music during his fights, and his attacks are named after different musical scores and compositions. In his first appearance, he has been instructed to capture Niijima. After being defeated by Ken`ichi, he goes on a journey to find himself. Niijima later, in Battle 110, convinces him to join the Shinpaku Alliance, where he acts as the Alliance`s combat leader and as Niijima`s personal guard. His training has made him virtually unbeatable, during the D of D tournament, Siegfried claims that he has no more weaknesses.",
