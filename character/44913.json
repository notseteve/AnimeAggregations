  "description" : "First featured in Daicon III Opening animation in 1981, the Daicon Girl appears again in Daicon IV Opening animation in 1983. This time, as a grown up girl wearing a bunny suit and surfing on Stormbringer sword. The illegal use of Playboy bunny suit and Electric Light Orchestra`s Prologue / Twilight songs prevented the video to be commercially released until now.\nThe character is mostly remembered for her memorable fight against Eastern and Western SF characters, villains, heroes, famous starships and monsters. This short animation introduced fandom aspects now considered staples of Japanese animation. Among them, the bunny girl theme and Gainax Breast Bounce (yure mune).\nFor years, Daicon Girl and Daicon opening animations were and are still considered as symbol of otaku culture. In this respect, the character itself is often referenced in other Gainax projects. It also inspired other characters including Noriko (Gunbuster), Misty May (Otaku no Video) and Mina Tsukuda (Getsumen to Heiki Mina and Densha Otoko opening). Haruka (FLCL) and Hatsune Miku both portrayed the character at some point.\nThere has been much speculation between Daicon fans about the character`s real name. Annie May (pronounced as Anime) has been proposed, which would be referenced in Otaku no Video fictious Misty May character. However, it should be noted that all official products, figures, books and videos released by Daicon Film, Gainax and General Products always used Daicon IVの女の子 (Daicon IV Girl).",
