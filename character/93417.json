  "description" : "Luculia Marlborough is a graduate of the Auto Memories Doll Training School and a newbie Auto Memories Doll. She befriended Violet at the training school.\nLuculia had a normal, yet very peaceful childhood with her parents and older brother, Spencer. When the war began, Spencer was drafted into the army. However, there wasn`t much fighting on the Western Front where Spencer was located, so Luculia claims that the war didn`t feel real to them. However, one day when her parents went to a town for business, the Western Front was broken through, and her parents were killed in the fighting.\nAfter the war ended, Spencer came back alive, which was more than enough to make Luculia happy despite their parents` deaths. However, Spencer blamed himself for the deaths of their parents, and fell into depression and alcoholism, after which Luculia began taking care of him.\nSource: Violet Evergarden Wiki",
