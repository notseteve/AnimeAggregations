  "description" : "Shibuya Shouma is the father of Yuuri and Shouri. He is a Mazoku from Shin Makoku. He originally knew about Yuuri becoming Maou when he met with Conrad shortly after Conrad came to Earth. Shouma was originally angered by Conrad`s cold attitude, and told him to never let his son or wife see that unsmiling face. Conrad takes those words to heart, and later grows to become the `smiling godfather` Yuuri often sees. Shouma is much more soft-spoken than his wife, and a fan of the Boston Red Sox.",
