Her powers including floating, teleportation, and manipulating wind and snow. She been http://anidb.net/ch41591 [Miyu]`s rival for a long time, seeking to destroy shinma, believing Miyu is not fit to do the job. She is less sympathetic than Miyu, and is known to kill innocents who get in her way of destroying shinma.\nReiha`s father was the head of a group of shinma protectors whose task was to ensure that a guardian (in this case, Miyu) would emerge during the Taishou period. When Reiha`s father was struck down by the Bird Shinma, Black Kite, he called out Miyu`s name instead of Reiha`s before he died. Reiha has never forgiven Miyu for this.\nSource: wiki",
