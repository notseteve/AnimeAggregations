  "description" : "While physically an attractive female, she still retains her masculine mannerisms and fighting abilities, attracting the `Megu-chan Protection Club`, a group of misfit admirers. The viewer knows she used to be a he but was transformed into a girl, initially only knows this Miki, but the protection club quickly finds out. Out of all the men in Furinkan High, the only one who seems to make any headway is Genzo Souga for his unparalleled willingness to do anything to prove himself to Megumi. A tomboy at heart, if she unintentionally displays any sort of affection for anyone, she is very quick to deny everything. At the end of the manga, it is revealed that she was and always had been a girl. One of the main reason why she wished to be a boy was because when they were younger, despite being stronger than Genzo, he injured himself to protect her, saying that it was because it is a man`s duty to protect a girl.",
