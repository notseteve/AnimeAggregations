  "description" : "The Solo Ship was originally discovered by archeologists on the Planet Solo while preparing that planet for colonization. The Solo Ship was the second of 2 major archeological finds (the first being the Ideon), found at a second archeological site. When the Buff Clan attacked the Planet Solo and quickly annihilated the planet`s capital, New Lopia, the colonists quickly fled to the only place where they could be safe - the Solo Ship. Originally thought to be nothing more than a ruin, the Solo Ship quickly responded to the power of `Ide`, which emerged due to the start of the war. The surviving colonists fled the planet Solo in this ship and remained in it until the series.\nLike the Ideon, the Solo Ship has few weapons of its own at first, but is equipped with various cannons and missile launchers by the colonists who occupy it. Its main defense is the Ideon itself, which can stand right on the deck of the ship and surround the both of them with its powerful barrier. What makes the Solo Ship special and more advanced than anything Earthlings had before is its DS Drive, which enables the Solo Ship to enter Null-Space and travel as fast as any Buff Clan craft.\nThe Solo Ship is destroyed at the end of `The Ideon: Be Invoked` by a blast from the Gando Rowa.",
