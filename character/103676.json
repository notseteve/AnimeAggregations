  "description" : "is a worshipper of Jashin.\nRyÅ«ki dislikes the peace that spread throughout the world after the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, as he feels it makes the countries and its people weak. To rectify this, he decided to follow in Hidan`s footsteps by becoming immortal, and with that immortality, he would bring death and destruction back to the world and establish himself as its ruler. In order for Jashin to grant him immortality, he needed to acquire a large number of sacrifices. To that end, he and his fellow Jashinists began abducting young girls travelling through the mountains of the Land of Hot Water, luring them in by preying on their deepest desires.",
