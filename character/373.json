  "description" : "Hitmonlee is a fighting type Pokémon that evolves from Tyrogue. Hitmonlee`s name is a combination of hit (suggesting its role as a martial arts pokémon), mon (a common abbreviation for `monster` in various collectible monster games, such as Digimon and Pokémon), and lee (an allusion to actor and martial artist Bruce Lee). Its Japanese name is most likely a reference to Tadashi Sawamura. Hitmonlee`s anatomy, a humanoid with no discernible head who instead has a face on his chest, is similar to that of the classical Blemmyes. Hitmonlee have a natural wrapping around their powerful legs. They have three fingers on each hand, but their hands are used mainly to maintain balance during kicks. Any punch or hand based moves bred into or learned by a Tyrogue will carry into either of its evolved forms. This means that even a Hitmonlee can be taught punching moves, such as Mach Punch and Fire Punch.",
