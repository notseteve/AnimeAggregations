  "description" : "Azan is an old-fashioned knight who practices a code of honor and loyalty. Formerly a devout Vice-Commander of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, he leaves to become a supporting companion to http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] and a member of his party.\nAzan is an elder man who is notorious for almost always wearing armor. He`s balding and has a thick mustache. His helmet is reminiscent of a samurai warrior`s kabuto, and his constitution is muscular, but stout. Recently, he was shown to be a bit taller than dwarves.\nSince Azan follows old fashioned code of honor. when he fought Guts one on one he ordered the others to stand down. He is shown to care for his fellow knights as shown when he felt ashamed when he fainted and trapped under the rappels and was unable to save them. He is shown to help others whenever he can as when he helped http://anidb.net/ch87813 [Schierke] and her friends against the pirates without being asked.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
