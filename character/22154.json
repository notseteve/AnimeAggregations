  "description" : "ZAFT`s newest and most powerful prototype mobile suit. Like the Freedom and Justice, the Providence Gundam is equipped with a Neutron Jammer Canceler and powered by a nuclear engine, and it`s armed with a set of remote weapons inspired by the gunbarrels of the Moebius Zero. This DRAGOON System can be used to attack enemies from multiple directions at the same time, but its high energy consumption means it can only be used by a nuclear-powered machine like the Providence, and it requires a pilot with superhuman powers of spatial awareness. As a result, this unique mobile suit becomes the personal machine of Rau Le Creuset, who uses it to devastating effect during the Second Battle of Jachin Due.",
