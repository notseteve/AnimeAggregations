  "description" : "Blissey is very compassionate and caring, and if it detects any feelings of sadness through its fur, it will immediately sprint towards the source and share one of its eggs. This egg is an exquisite delicacy in the Pokémon universe, and it immediately causes whoever eats it to enter a state of euphoria, becoming kindhearted to everyone. Blissey will tend to any ailing creature with loving care, using the healing power in its egg.\nIn the anime, Blissey appeares a lot in Pokémon Centers alongside Nurse Joy. Blissey and the various Nurse Joys (of which there are many) are trusted with the medical care of many different types of Pokemon. Almost all of Blissey`s Pokémon Center appearances are mainly in the Johto Saga. In one episode, Jessie of Team Rocket reunites a Blissey who used to be a Chansey when they were both studying to be nurses.",
