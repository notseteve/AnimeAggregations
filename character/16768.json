  "description" : "Sasuke is the Class President of the Ninja Academy. Sasuke is some times easy to spot, but he is one of the dozens of faceless male ninja in the series. These male ninja are seen in different outfits, but never without their masks. Onsokumaru and Shinobu seem able to tell them apart. They share many of Onsokumaru`s traits, although they are more kind hearted and conscientious, attempting to act noble and wise. They often join in on Onsokumaru`s perverted schemes, but have shown a distaste for certain levels he will go to. The ninja have even more than once joined together to punish Onsokumaru when he goes too far. They have a tendency to act with a `hive mind`, but are easily distracted and get little done.He and the some of the other male ninja form the \"Miyabi Fan Club\".",
