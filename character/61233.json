  "description" : "Lambda-11 is an imitation Murakumo Unit created by Kokonoe by combining the body of the 11th experimental replica of Saya with the soul of Nu, which was recovered after falling into the Gates of Sheol during the conclusion of Calamity Trigger`s Story Mode. Kokonoe completely erased her memory and as a result, Lambda is only interested in carrying out Kokonoe`s orders, although some fragment of her original self manages to resurface when she confronts Ragna.\nSource: Wiki",
