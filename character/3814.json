  "description" : "A scholarship student, 16-year-old Juli is the top-ranking student and recognised leader of the Zwei. During Lucson`s stint as \"captain\", she was the actual de facto exerciser of that role, and after the fall of Team Blue, was appointed the role by majority vote. Her parents are presumed to have died at an early age, as she grew up in an orphanage and thus tends to solve problems by herself. Calm and kind, with an inner fortitude, Juli lacks the charisma of a leader. She is very beautiful, and those around her (especially her mostly-male classmates) see it as a shame she lacks a sense of her own femininity.",
