  "description" : "A tall, boyish, quiet wallflower with somewhat depressing looks, her power usually manifests as familiars - beings she controls made of paper; her sisters also rely on her for her strong defensive capabilities. She is known for being easily embarrassed and enjoying tight cosy spots to relax in (which is why she sleeps in the closet). Michelle says her favourite author is Ernest Hemingway, but Maggie quickly points out that she likes Nenene`s works too. She strongly looks up to her older sister, Michelle, and feels she`s nothing compared to her. She cares for her sisters and always tries to protect them at the expense of her own safety. Anita believes Maggie to be strongest Paper Sister in combat.",
