  "description" : "Shun is the Student Government Secretary. He`s always cheerful, no matter what the situation; he`s also very sharp, and eloquent with his words. Perhaps that`s why he`s so incredibly popular amongst the students (especially the ladies)! Shun has a lot of responsibilities around the school; he`s often called on to be an announcer at events, and he`s a member of the Theatre Club - a natural match for his acting skills.\nSource: shingu.rightstuf.com",
