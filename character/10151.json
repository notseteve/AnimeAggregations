  "description" : "Black haired and blue eyed like his mother, Sho is younger than Mitsuru by approximately two weeks. Although technically the \"true Ikeda,\" Sho is content to be the second son and cede inheritance of Kouryu Temple to Mitsuru.\nHe obviously loves his brother and is hurt by Mitsuru`s choice to move out of the house. He appears in both the anime (OAV 6) and manga. In manga volume 10, Sho`s grandfather asks him: \"Do you really hate the idea of becoming a monk that much?\" to which he replies \"I don`t hate it.\".\nWe also find out that Sho failed the Ryokuto entrance exam.",
