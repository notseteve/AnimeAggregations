  "description" : "Subaru is a petite, blue-haired woman who wears a light blue dress. She has small, feathery wings that sprout out of her back, and has a red wave tattoo on her forehead. She possesses a regal-looking axe, but rarely uses it in combat, preferring to hold it as a type of scepter. In the episode Recollection, when she reminisces the early days of the Crimson Knights, she is shown to have a pink dress.\nSubaru is soft spoken, but has a very determined personality. As the leader of the Crimson Knights, she is frequently called upon to settle disputes both inside and outside of the guild. Though she is aware of the power she wields, she is fiercely dedicated to her position and refuses to let such power change the way she acts. Subaru is very protective of The World`s players, and does her best to make The World a place that everybody can enjoy. Her strongest supporters are Silver Knight and Crim.",
