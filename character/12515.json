  "description" : "Eagle Vision is a well-known and respected commander from Cephiro`s neighbouring country, Autozam, a technologically advanced world reliant on the mental energy of its citizens for its power.\nIt is clear right away that Eagle is an enigmatic and forceful tactician, and though a gentle and chivalrous gentleman, he is the leader of Autozam`s invasion of Cephiro. His father is the President of Autozam.\nEagle comes to Cephiro with hopes of duplicating the Pillar System back on his home world, and also wishes to actually become the Pillar for personal reasons. Eagle is in fact very sick and wasn`t even supposed to be alive by the time he made it to Cephiro. Eagle reveals to Hikaru that he wants to become the Pillar to spare Lantis` life and be in an eternal sleep with Cephiro.\nIn the end, Hikaru tells him it is unfair of him to leave all his loved ones behind and saves him, bringing him back to Cephiro and starting him on the road to restoring his health. In the anime, however, Eagle sacrifices himself in order to save the Magic Knights.",
