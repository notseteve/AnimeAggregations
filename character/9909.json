  "description" : "Meryl Stryfe AKA \"Derringer Meryl\" and her junior coworker, Milly, are agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society sent to evaluate claims regarding Vash the Stampede. She`s hotheaded and strong willed. Initially, she finds Vash to be a nuisance and dismisses the idea that he is the legendary Humanoid Typhoon. As time passes, she realizes that Vash isn`t the villain that he is made out to be nor the buffoon that he presents himself to be. Gradually, she comes to respect Vash and love him deeply, though in the anime her love is more romantic than in the manga. Although she doesn`t often fight alongside Vash, she hides many derringer-style \"throwaway\" pistols under her coat. In the manga she becomes petrified of Vash after she witnesses his Plant-like nature and sees through his eyes the destruction of July City. After Bernardelli shuts down while Knives is ravaging the planet, she and Milly assume support roles along with Brad and Luida to help combat Knives. At the end of the manga`s story, the two become investigative reporters for the planet`s first television broadcasting channel, continuing to follow Vash wherever he goes.",
