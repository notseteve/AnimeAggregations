  "description" : "Hanzou, also known as Hanzou of the Salamander (山椒魚の半蔵, Sanshouuo no Hanzou), was a legendary ninja who was the former leader of Amegakure.\nHanzou became famous around the time of the Second Great Shinobi World War; when he fought some of Konoha`s forces, Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru were the only ones to survive. As a reward to them for this accomplishment, he named them Konoha`s Sannin in exchange for letting them live.\nYears after his battle with the Sannin, when a group of ninja began a quest to end war through unorthodox means within his country, Hanzou viewed them as a threat to his power and sought to get rid of them. He teamed up with Konoha`s Root organization to kill the group`s leader, Yahiko. He lured Yahiko to a meeting where he forced Nagato, Yahiko`s teammate, to kill Yahiko in exchange for Konan`s life.\nHowever, Yahiko committed suicide by impaling himself upon Nagato`s kunai to spare his friend the anguish and burden of killing him himself. Nagato slaughtered Hanzou`s forces in retribution along with the shinobi of Root who had come to aid Hanzou. After a brief skirmish with Nagato, Hanzou fled the scene realizing that he could not deal with Nagato when he was so enraged and thus escaped.\nNagato, under the alias of \"Pain\", would later begin a civil war within Amegakure. He single-handedly killed Hanzou, his family, and his retainers, and then conducted a systematic genocide of anybody even remotely associated with Hanzou, even to the extent of terminating the ambassadors of the villages Hanzou was associated with.",
