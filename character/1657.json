  "description" : "The leader of Edo`s police organisation, the Shinsengumi. He is a bit goofy, but nevertheless good-natured and honourable; the members of the Shinsengumi are loyal to him. He has a crush on Tae Shimura and stalks her, to which Otae responds with merciless beatings. His crush is apparently predicated on the fact that Otae answered yes when he asked if she would accept a man with hairy buttocks (which Kondo has). Some characters in the manga often call him a gorilla he once referred to himself as \"Gorilla Hitman 13\" (a play on Golgo 13) because he had been dumped by Otae thirteen times in that one year. He cosplayed as a rampant alien`s \"mother\" twice.",
