  "description" : "Kir is Jing`s sidekick, a feisty talking albatross (Crow in the manga) with a big mouth (Really annoying). Despite being a bird, he is constantly chasing human women, and usually hits on each episode`s Jing Girl at every opportunity. Nonetheless, he is always rejected (curiously, the rejection is always due to his mannerisms and personality, and not the fact that he is a bird.) Kir is a bit greedier than Jing and often wonders why the latter doesn`t go after targets with more monetary value. Nonetheless, he is a steadfast friend and invaluable partner to Jing.",
