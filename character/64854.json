  "description" : "Momo is the number 5 member of the Blindfold group.\nHer ability is \"Captivation\". She can capture the attention of any people to herself, regardless of what she is doing or wearing. This ability made her to be a very popular idol who is loved by everyone. She is rather unable to control her powers and thus is unable to have a normal life. On an attempt to be a normal girl which fails, Kido recruits her into the gang.\nShe constantly hangs out with Kido since her power can cancel Momo`s.\nJust like the other members of the group, she acquired her ability after having a near death experience. She was drowning in the sea and her father dived to rescue her. They enter the Void Space (Heat Haze). Momo managed to escape while leaving her dad behind.\nHer songs are: \"Kisaragi Attention\" which tells her everyday struggles to be a normal girl and \"Otsukimi Recital\" (Moon Viewing Recital) which tells the story of her attempts to cheer up her brother after the death of his best friend, Ayano.",
