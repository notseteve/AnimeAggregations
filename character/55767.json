  "description" : "Lauder`s Haxorus suddenly started rampaging and stopped listening to its trainer Lauder entirely. When Lauder tried to return Ononokus to its monster ball, it refuses to go inside. Iris` Dragonite was sent out to try and stop Ononokus but it too began to rampage. Lauder was very upset that his Pok√©mon was doing so much destruction to the city as it was normally docile and kind. Lauder later learned that it was Plasma Gang controlling his Ononokus and was nothing that he had done to make it go crazy on a rampage.",
