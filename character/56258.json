She wields a sword that is actually one half of a giant pair of scissors made by her father, http://anidb.net/ch61732 [Dr. Matoi Isshin]; the other half was stolen by his killer, and she appears to believe that, by picking fights everywhere with her blade, she will eventually find clues about her father`s death and the identity of his murderer.",
