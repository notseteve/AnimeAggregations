  "description" : "Munchlax is the pre-evolved form of Snorlax. It wolfs down its weight in food once a day, swallowing food whole with almost no chewing. It hides food under its long body hair. However, it sometimes forgets it has hidden the food there. Munchlax behaves quite opposite of its evolution, Snorlax, as it is somewhat hyperactive, though it is very similar with its eating patterns. It does not mind walking and running from place to place as it looks for food. Munchlax eats the most food of any Pokémon besides its evolution, Snorlax. It will eat nearly anything. It can rarely become full and will eat constantly, unlike Snorlax, who eats in between sleeping.\nOne can obtain a Munchlax by breeding two Snorlax with the mother holding a Full Incense, or by smearing honey on trees and waiting to see if it appears. However, it is the rarest Pokémon to catch by doing so. Wild Munchlax can only be found in honey trees in the games.",
