  "description" : "Ryuushi, the male protagonist of the series, is an aspiring children`s book artist. He moved into Narutaki Sou so he could attend the Sumeragi Design School in Tokyo. Second cousins with Aoba Kozue. He had apparently met Kozue when the two were younger, but he doesn`t remember about this at the start of the series. In the beginning, he is eighteen years old and his birthday is September 9. His personality is both childish as well as passive to the point of never objecting when anyone does anything wrong to him which happens a lot.\nSource: Wikipedia",
