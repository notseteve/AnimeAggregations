  "description" : "Wrath differs greatly in the first anime and in the manga. In the manga and second anime, Wrath is the true identity of King Bradley. The first anime shows the origins of Wrath in Izumi Curtis`s attempt to revive her infant child. Her effort failed, and the infant`s body was taken beyond the Gate of Truth. There, the child, Wrath, grew up. When Edward Elric later lost his arm and leg while trying to revive his mother, Wrath took both for himself, which allowed him to use alchemy and escape to Amestris. Because of his ability to perform alchemy, Wrath can assimilate any sort of material or object into his body. Since the remains of his former body were used in his creation, Wrath lacks the weaknesses of the other homunculi, though both the Gate of Truth and the cries of a child have similar psychological effects on him. His Ouroboros tattoo is under his right foot,",
