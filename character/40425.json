  "description" : "Bianca`s Shelmet was revealed during her gym battle against Elesa. Bianca captured it sometime before that battle. It didn`t last too long in the battle as Elesa`s Zebstrika was a very strong opponent which defeated it quite swiftly. To help it recover from the battle, Iris made it a remedy to restore its health. Bianca`s Shelmet was a very timid Pok√©mon as it was shy during battling as well as when it had to interact with anyone.\nBattle against Professor Juniper`s Karrablast\nProfessor Juniper wanted to have a battle with her Karrablast against Bianca`s Shelmet to record their data before the evolution. Bianca agreed but the battle didn`t turn out as interesting as Cilan hoped it would. Bianca`s Shelmet kept hiding in its shell and used Protect to increase its defense. The battle was cut short when one of Professor Juniper`s assistants informed her that they were having problems at the base camp.\nLink Trade Evolution\nBianca`s Shelmet was traded with Professor Juniper`s Karrablast using Professor Juniper link trade device. After solving the problems with the electrical interference the trade was successful and Bianca`s Shelmet evolved into Professor Juniper`s Accelgor while Professor Juniper`s Karrablast evolved into Bianca`s Escavalier.",
