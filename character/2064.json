  "description" : "One of Chuder`s armies, charged with the defence of Doldrey under the command of General Boscogn. They were defeated by the Band of the Hawk, largely due to Governer Gennon overruling the military command structure and seizing direct control of the army from the battlefield, over the protests of Boscogn. This key defeat was instrumental in forcing and end to Midland-Chuder hostilities and the signing of an armistice treaty shortly thereafter.",
