  "description" : "The chief engineer in charge of Dancouga Nova, she has a flirty, playful personality and tells the team before each mission to look out for her \"baby\". Later, it is revealed that she often has brief, unfulfilling relationships, and focuses on Dancouga as it, unlike a man, can`t hurt her feelings. When Sakuya asked her for a private conversation shortly afterwards, she seemed surprised and interested - until it turned out that he only wanted to talk shop, annoying her greatly.\nSource: Wiki",
