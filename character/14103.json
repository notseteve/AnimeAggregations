  "description" : "Sealand is unofficially the smallest nation in the world. Dressed in a sailor suit, Sealand is the youngest and smallest character in the series. He was created after England made him, but left him in the middle of the sea and forgot about him. However, nobody recognizes Sealand as a nation in his own right. As a result, he has to try other ways of getting noticed. For example, he once went to a meeting disguised as Canada. In the film Paint it, White, Sealand is shown that he has the ability to run across water and jump great heights, being able to jump from sea-level to his platform in a single leap. He refers to England as jerk England or British jerk.",
