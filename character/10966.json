  "description" : "Pakkun is a petite pug, and the smallest of http://anidb.net/ch7248 [Hatake Kakashi]`s Ninken. Despite this, he is summoned the most often, and was the only one of the dogs to be shown speaking in Part I. According to the anime, Pakkun was able to say Kakashi`s name at four months of age. Despite his cute appearance, his voice is deep and gruff. When Pakkun, http://anidb.net/ch240 [Naruto], and http://anidb.net/ch7194 [Sakura] were sent to help Sasuke, he revealed that he is not a battle-type ninja dog, which Sakura claimed to know by looking at his small appearance. In the anime, he revealed that he used Floral Green shampoo (Minty Rain Forest Mist Shampoo with extra bodywash in the English dub), which is also used by Sakura (Sakura was comically traumatized at the thought of using the same shampoo as a dog). In Japanese, Pakkun uses the form of \"I\" that is used by elderly men (washi).",
