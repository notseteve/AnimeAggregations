  "description" : "Signum is the leader of the Wolkenritter, a creation of the Book of Darkness. She is a program meant to protect the Book of Darkness and originally was devoid of all emotions but after Hayate became her new master Signum gradually changed. Her weapon, Laevatein, can assume at least two distinct forms. Just like all Wolkenritter Signum belongs to the Belka style of magic excelling in close-quarter fighting. Her name comes from the large family car Opel Signum.\nIn the end of Nanoha A`s, Reinforce releases all the Wolkenritter in physical forms at the cost of her own existence. In an epilogue that takes place six years later, Signum has a 25 years old appearance(as she is ten years older than Fate and Nanoha), and still lives with the other Wolkenritter and Hayate, posing as the adoptive parent of Hayate.\nIn StrikerS Signum is a sub-commander and instructor of the Lightning squad, led by Fate T. Harlaown, though she doesn`t work on training the recruits at first.\nIn serious battles Signum uses Unison with Reinforce II for increased power.",
