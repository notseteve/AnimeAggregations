  "description" : "Hayate is the director of Team Red Meteor and he gives his others teammates instructions on what to do. His father did everything in his power to find the ultimate Dendimushi which was even alternately colored. He is very cocky and according to Rotom Pok√©dex, he is 100 percent unpleasant. Hayate`s brother Yansu is also on the team.\nHe competed in the 25th Kokeko Cup where they were the self-imposed favorites to win the race and his pushy nature ended up being too much for their Dendimushi car which got stuck on ice going up a hill in the 3rd and final stage, resulting in them loosing the race to Sophocles`s Charjabug car.",
