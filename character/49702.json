  "description" : "The largest and newest carrier in the Varauta fleet. Equipped with numerous anti-ship and anti-fighter weapons, the New Giant Carrier has the same firepower as a heavy cruiser. However, the New Giant Carrier`s greatest asset is the capability to hold some 200 variable fighters. These fighters are released from 8 scramble catapults that can accommodate the launching of 3 fighters per catapult for a maximum of 24 simultaneous fighter launches. All 200 variable fighters can be prepared and launched within 20 minutes.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/varauta-newgiantcarrier.htm",
