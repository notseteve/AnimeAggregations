  "description" : "Kanzaki Hibiki works as an entertainment reporter for the television network SNN (Scramble News Network). He wants to be more, however, and jumps at the chance to cover the first encounters with the Marduk invaders. While covering one of the battles, he discovers http://anidb.net/ch35303 [Ishtar], an Emulator used to excite the aggressive tendencies of the Marduk through her singing. Originally seeing the scoop of a lifetime, Hibiki harbors http://anidb.net/ch35303 [Ishtar] on Earth and shows her Earth`s culture but is eventually moved by http://anidb.net/ch35303 [Ishtar]`s belief in bringing peace to her people by spreading Earth`s love songs. At the same time Hibiki also finds himself having to deal with the U.N. Spacy, who is overzealous in not allowing any possibility of public panics despite having the frontline pushed all the way back to Earth itself.\nSource: wiki",
