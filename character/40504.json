  "description" : "Andre is a Pokémon Trainer that was visiting Don George`s Battle Club in Karakusa Town. His name actually appears on the computer screen in the anime language when Ash and Iris noticed he was currently battling.\nAs Ash and Iris walked into the battle area of the club, they watched as Andre defeated Urara`s Servine. Andre noticed Pikachu and he asked Ash to have a battle with him which he agreed to. Ash`s Oshawott came out of its Poké ball just as the battle was about to start but Ash recalled it. Andre sent out his Futachimaru again to battle even though it has just finished battling with and even though it had a type disadvantage against Pikachu. The two of them battle intensely and despite Pikachu type advantage, Andre`s Dewott was able to hold its ground and do significant damage with its Razor Shell. The battle concluded in a draw though as Battle Club`s emergency alarm went off.",
