  "description" : "The 6th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet, formed some time prior to 796 UC.\nThis fleet was dispatched to the front during the Third Battle of Tiamat as part of the FPA reinforcements, but did not arrive until after the battle. Its appearance at the front played a role in the Imperial withdrawal from the Tiamat starzone.\nDuring the Battle of Astarte, the 6th Fleet consisted of 13,000 warships. It was almost completely destroyed during that engagement by the Imperial Fleet under http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], as part of his individual attacks against the separated Alliance forces. After the battle, the survivors were amalgamated into the newly formed 13th Fleet.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
