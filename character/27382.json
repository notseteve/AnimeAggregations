  "description" : "Leavanny, known as the Nurturing Pokémon, evolves from Swadloon if it has high happiness. Happiness is gained by leveling up Pokémon, but decreases slightly if it faints. Its appearance is similar to that of a mantis. It weaves clothing for small Pokémon, especially Sewaddle, using the cutters on its arm and its sticky silk. It also keeps its eggs warm from fermenting leaves. It makes clothes by attaching mucoid string to the tips of its hands and sews leaves together.\nIn the Best Wishes Pokémon anime series, Burgh`s Leavanny has appeared in the episodes Sewaddle and Burgh in Pinwheel Forest! and Battling For The Love of Bug-Types!. In the latter episode, he uses it in battle when Ash challenges him for the Insect Badge. Later, in the episode Battling the Leaf Thieves, Ash`s Swadloon evolves into Leavanny in a practice battle with Iris`s Emolga.",
