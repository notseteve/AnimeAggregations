  "description" : "In our world, Rara is a Nobel Prize winning scientist. In the parallel world, he`s become something of a megalomaniac. It was he who began the war in the first place, transforming himself into a messiah-like figure (\"You fools have no fear of God!\", \"the divine power of the Rara Army\").\nIn the bizarre scene where Kazuki actually has dinner with the Rara family, the General reveals a softer side of himself; he believes that the war is about keeping the alien technology out of the wrong hands. However, it quickly becomes clear that Rara is simply a figurehead, with his wife wielding the real power. He \"Redeems\" himself, however, when Kazuki attacks their base, and gets everyone out before it gets destroyed.\nWhen Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Rara and his wife move in next door to the Sanadas, hoping to corral Kazuki into revealing the secret of his connection to Zinv.",
