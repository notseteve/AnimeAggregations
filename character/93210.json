  "description" : "Ashen Eye is a very old Faerie. Underneath the shroud, he has 3 eyes, with spiraling pupils.\nAshen Eye has a perplexing relationship with humans, taking interest in the fleeting nature of a human life in comparison to a Neighbor`s. He cherishes the moment a child becomes an adult, but also takes pleasure out of seeing a human shaken to the core of their soul.\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki",
