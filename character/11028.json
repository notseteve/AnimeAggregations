  "description" : "The Salamis, smaller and less heavily armed than the Magellan, makes up the bulk of the Earth Federation`s space fleet. Its standard armament includes six main guns, six anti-aircraft machine gun turrets, and two missile launchers, but it can also be refitted for reconnaissance and other special missions. Like the Magellan, the Salamis carries a small atmospheric re-entry capsule on its underside.",
