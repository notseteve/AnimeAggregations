  "description" : "Nevin is Wu-il dragon, the dragon species that are known to be the bearers of forest and greenery after they die and return to earth. Before Nevin passed away, he shared a memory with http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise] of the great dragon`s flight. On his passing, he asked Chise to return and make a staff from one of his branches, as she`s likely to need one as a mage.\nChise returned after a while and with http://anidb.net/ch90555 [Lindel]`s help, they made a staff from Nevin`s branch, with Lindel offering to make the final touches. After he returned it to Chise, she was summoned into the boundary between the living and the deceased where she was reunited with Nevin for one more time. She told him about her troubles, after which he gave her an advice before she departed.\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki, edited.",
