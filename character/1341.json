  "description" : "Shamal, being Yuuno`s counterpart, does not actually fight, but uses her ring devices to defend, create portals, absorb victims` Linker Cores into the Book of Darkness, and the like. Her weapon is named Klarer Wind, Ring of the Breezes, its master, Shamal is known as Lady of the Lake. When she transformed, her armour is green in colour just like her magic colour and came with a hat somewhat like Vita, different only by the colour and minor designs. She is typically kind, polite and devoted to Hayate. Shamal acts as the `mother` of the group, doing the shopping, worrying excessively over the others` well-being, and constructing excuses to Hayate as to why they are out so often (\"The grocery store doesn`t have our brand of olive oil\"). She knows that Hayate does not want them to fight anyone for her, but it is still no question that they must. She is named for the Maserati Shamal.",
