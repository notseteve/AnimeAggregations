  "description" : "This Mudsdale is a strong Pok√©mon that helps Hapu get around the island quickly. It carries the Poni Radish`s after they are harvested. During a Grand Trial battle against Pikachu, it showed off its great defense but Ash Ketchum`s unique battle tactics got it wet from the ocean and way more susceptible to electric attacks. It was defeated after Pikachu used Gigavolt Havoc on it while still wet.",
