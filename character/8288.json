  "description" : "While he had ambitions of being a stage performer, Ken is a pretty fragile guy who cannot exercise or eat spicy foods due to a chronic heart condition. Despite this, Ken does everything he can to support the cast and crew of Kaleido Stage. Ken is Sora`s biggest supporter and does everything he can to help her out. While he really likes Sora, his timing of approaching her is always bad, dashing his hopes of getting with her. Ken shows exceptional promise as a show producer.",
