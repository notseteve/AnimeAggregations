  "description" : "He was known in Sanctuary as the Saint who could control crows like his own limbs. Jamian was part of the second team of Silver Saints that had the mission of kidnapping Saori Kido and destroying the Colosseum where the \"Galaxian Wars\" took place. He succeeded in kidnapping the young woman, but was followed by Pegasus Seiya. The Silver Saint overpowered the Bronze Saint, but Saori Kido retaliated with Athena`s Cosmo, sending Jamian`s crows to attack him instead. Confused and outraged, he called her a witch and charged, only to be blasted away by the arrival of Phoenix Ikki, and killed by his Houyoku Tenshou attack.\nSource: Wikipedia",
