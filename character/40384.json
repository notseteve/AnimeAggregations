  "description" : "Luke is a Pokémon movie maker who lives in a town near Raimon City. Ash first encountered Luke just after he finished watching the trailer for \"Miracle Fighter the Movie Part 24: The Mystery of the Miracle Shooter\" and he turned around to see the Miracle Fighter right behind him. Luke`s Zorua then transformed back into its normal Zorua state and Ash thought about catching it until Luke came running saying it was his Zorua.\nLuke met his Zorua while helping out Matthew with the projection machines. Every movie, Zorua would transform into the main heroine and watch the movie. Eventually Luke figured out that it was Zorua transforming and then asked Zorua if it wanted to help him with a movie he was making. From then on, Zorua became Luke`s partner in making productions.\nLuke helps out Matthew with the projections and in exchange for his help, Matthew allows him to watch the movies for free. Matthew was the one that told Luke about the battle tournament in Raimon.\nLuke was working on the movie \"Legend of the Pokémon Knight\" when Cilan suggested that they should help him out. Luke was grateful for the extra help and the movie became a great success.",
