  "description" : "Neo Zeon`s elite Royal Guard squadron, charged with the protection of their leader Haman Karn, operates a handful of customized mobile suits during the First Neo Zeon War. One of these units, Lance Gylen`s AMX-117L Gazu-L, is modeled after the Earth Federation Forces` mass-produced RMS-117 Galbaldy Î². With a more powerful reactor and armament geared to melee combat, the Gazu-L is highly distinguished by its eye-catching red-on-white paint scheme and the large, flared armor on its left shoulder. Designed to operate in tandem with its twin, Nee Gylen`s AMX-117R Gazu-R, the Gazu-L typically escorts either Haman`s AMX-004 Qubeley or Royal Guard leader Chara Soon`s AMX-015 Geymalk on its left flank.\nSource: mahq.net",
