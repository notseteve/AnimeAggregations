  "description" : "A new warrior in the sequel, Shin Koihime Musou. She`s easily distinguished by her black hair with white streaks on the right side. A devoted bodyguard of Ryuubi. Has a tomboyish personality and seems to take exception to any kind of behavior that suggests affection or attraction, whether from people, or animals (such as Ryofu`s dogs). Initially hostile towards Kazuto and thinks of him as a perverted troublemaker, until she is \"punished\" by Batai in a very humiliating way (Batai tricked Gien into a well prepared snare trap, and then tickled her). At first denying it, she eventually realizes she likes Kazuto.",
