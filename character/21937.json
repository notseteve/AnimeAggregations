  "description" : "Iku represents the Gemini. He is currently a student teacher and is friends with the school nurse, Kotarou, since they were children. Iku and his twin sister Yui were both born with poor health, and Yui died while they were in high school. He was formerly the lead singer of a band the heroine liked, but destroyed his voice while overworking himself due to the pain of his sister`s death. His band members turned out to be using him for money and promptly dismissed him when he could no longer sing. Iku lost trust in everyone until Tsukiko helped him gain it back.",
