  "description" : "Bouffalant, known as the Headbutt Bull Pokémon, is a large, brown buffalo Pokémon. It features a large, magnificent afro on its head with two equally large horns popping out of it. Each horn has two golden rings on it. It has light brown hair ending at its knees. Even if it is dealt with a violent headbutt, its tufty fur absorbs the damage. It charges and headbutts anything indiscriminately. The destructive power will derail a running train.\nThe Escapist listed Bouffalant as one of the new Pokémon with \"really cool designs\", describing it as \"the afro-sporting bison\".",
