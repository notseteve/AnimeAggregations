  "description" : "Jing is the protagonist of the series. A dashing young thief in a flowing orange trenchcoat, his exceptional skills and dedication are seemingly contradicted by his laid-back manner. He approaches life with a disarming, confident cheerfulness, selecting his targets seemingly on a whim. Because he is such a legendary figure, many people are surprised when they meet him in person, as he is rather small and unassuming at first glance. His skills as a thief, however, are without equal. He travels the world with his best friend, Kir, a talking albatross with whom he can combine to unleash the deadly Kir Royale attack, which is a green ball of energy shot out of Kir`s mouth.",
