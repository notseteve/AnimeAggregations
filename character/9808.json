  "description" : "Sakura is a 191-year-old kitsune (fox spirit), though she looks to be only 19 and Natsuki`s partner for a time. She has human ancestors, thus she was born with only 8 and 1/5th tails and was teased because of it as a child. Kitsune must have a full nine tails in order to have full use of their power, thus Sakura has spent many years hunting for a powerful being to consume, in order to attain that full power. Sakura joins the Police Company after seeing Natuski in action, in hopes of consuming her in order to gain her full ninth tail. She can fly, has some minor electrical power and is an excellent shot with a gun, but she cannot shapeshift. Sakura is from Osaka, thus has a knack for bartering and handling money.",
