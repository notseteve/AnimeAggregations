  "description" : "The Mindbreakers are an interesting new group involved in this battle. They are a group of men and women who have an odd ability; the power to unlock the potential powers of the http://anidb.net/ch40598 [Arayashiki], http://anidb.net/ch40609 [WIZ-DOM], http://anidb.net/ch40610 [Darklore], http://anidb.net/ch40611 [E.G.O.], and even http://anidb.net/ch40636 [Eraser] factions, as well as to somehow gain control of them. They are not a faction like the other five, since each Mindbreaker has his or her own goals and purposes to achieve, as well as methods to achieve them. This often leads Mindbreakers to battle each other. The victor of such a battle gains the loser`s powerâ€”the members of Arayashiki, WIZ-DOM, Darklore, E.G.O. and Eraser previously under the loser`s control.\nPrecisely how a Mindbreaker controls one of these factions, much less how they can awaken the new powers within them, is still unknown. Speculation ranges anywhere from advanced psionic powers to emotional attachment. As of yet, there`s no single rule to explain this ability, but the presence of a mindbreaker favoring a member of the previously mentioned factions is often enough to tip the balance in a battle.",
