  "description" : "Luciano Bradley is the Knight of Ten, and is known by the sobriquet \"the Vampire of Britannia\". A violent and confrontational man, he is fond of antagonizing others and attacking without provocation; several of the Knights of the Round appear to dislike him. He shows little care for the lives he ends, be they friend or foe, as long as he can cause destruction. In fact, he fights battles specifically because it allows him to freely kill people in public, even attempting to sacrifice his allies for a fleeting tactical advantage. He claims to be a \"homicide genius\", and carries a number of large knives which he is adept at throwing. He is fiercely loyal to the Empire, but he does as he pleases most of the time, even around members of the Imperial family. He pilots the Knightmare Frame Percival.",
