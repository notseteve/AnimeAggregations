  "description" : "Rachel Alucard is a vampire and the current head of the noble Alucard family. Rachel slipped out of her castle in search of fun because she hates to be bored. Due to her hair ties, many characters call her rabbit, a name that irritates her to no end, though Ragna seems to be the only one who can get away with calling her an idiot. Despite her status however, she deeply loathes her vampiric impulses. She seems to be watching Ragna, as she is the one who accidentally turned him into a half-vampire by giving him her powers (this is also the reason behind his heterochromia and healing ability). Due to this, he is one of the only characters who is aware of her. She also watches and toys with the other characters as part of her amusement.\nSource: Wikipedia",
