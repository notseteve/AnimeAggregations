  "description" : "Akatsuki is a trainee \"salamander\", one of those responsible for maintaining Aqua`s weather. He usually lives on the floating island in Aqua`s atmosphere where the weather controls are, but often comes down to the ground to see his chronically irresponsible brother. Akatsuki was born in Neo-Venezia, but as he spends most of his time on the floating island he doesn`t really know very much about the city.\nAkatsuki tends to be cynical and has an even shorter fuse than Aika. But although he`s grumpy and ill-tempered most of the time, he`s really a nice guy who rather likes Akari (though you`ll never see him admit it). He likes to pull on Akari`s pigtails (it`s also his favorite nickname for her).\nSource: http://drawerofdreams.net/neo-venezia/chara/akatsuki.html",
