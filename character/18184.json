  "description" : "Pain (Preta Path) was the third of Nagato`s Six Paths of Pain to be shown. It was incapacitated during the invasion of Pain after it absorbed too much of Naruto Uzumaki`s senjutsu chakra and turned into a toad statue.\nWhen it was alive, the Preta Path belonged to a large, bulky man from Kusagakure. The anime showed that he was both a ninja and a farmer who`d failed to cultivate the land for his family due to his participation in the Third Great Shinobi World War. The Preta Path, like all of the six paths, possessed Nagato`s Rinnegan. It had orange hair tied in a short ponytail. It had small spike piercings covering its entire bottom lip, two vertical spike studs on the front of his nose, two spike studs (one on each cheek), a metal bar going through each ear, and a stud on his shoulder, one on each side, close to his neck.\nThis path`s \"Energy Absorption\" ability was primarily defensive, since it was capable of absorbing any ninjutsu-related technique, thereby nullifying its effect. This technique could also take the form of a barrier around its body, allowing it to absorb attacks from all directions. In addition to its defensive properties, this body`s ability had also shown offensive capabilities, as it could absorb all the chakra out of any person that it touched or grabbed.",
