  "description" : "Frankenstein (Kor. 프랑켄슈타인) (commonly referred to as chairman by the children) is Rai`s devoted servant. He supports Rai whole-heartedly and calls him \"Master\". He had tried searching for his master after Rai`s apparent \"disappearance.\" Frankenstein is the principal/director of Ye Ran High School. He was stunned to find Rai in his school office after Rai had woken up and dressed in his school`s uniform.\nFrankenstein is a very cheerful and loyal person, especially toward his master, but can become quite serious and calculative when the situation calls for it. Although Frankenstein has shown somewhat of a sadistic side during his recurrent battles, like Rai, he is also compassionate towards human beings, especially towards the students in his school.\nFrankenstein is immensely powerful but some of his powers had been sealed away by Rai due to him misusing them in the past. After 820 years of sealing, Rai has finally taken off the punishment. But whenever Frankenstein gets serious in fighting uses his full power, Rai shows a considerable amount of anxiety.",
