  "description" : "Left Hand is a symbiote lodged in the hand of the http://anidb.net/ch15699 [D].\nSuspicions abound as to what exactly the left hand is. He is referred as being a part of the same species as one of the Barbaroi. Left Hand belongs to a species of (normally) malevolent parasites that inhabit different parts of the human body. Despite this, Left Hand is as unique in his abilities among his people as D is among other dhampirs. Whether this is due to being in the body of a dhampir or that he was a servant of D`s father is unknown.\nLeft Hand, does though perform many important duties in the story. He uses to D`s advantage his special psychic abilities, and often extracts truth and veritable bits of information that aid D on his wanderings.\nIn terms of personality, Left Hand tends to be a stark contrast to the stoic D, often making sarcastic remarks or cracking jokes. The two appear to have been together a long time as Left Hand talks about D`s heritage and past though D often quickly shuts him up if he tries to mention his father.",
