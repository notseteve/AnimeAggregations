  "description" : "Ryofu Housen is a silent girl who is the greatest and the most powerful warrior of all in the kingdoms. She was thought as a monster in the mountains, but it all ended in a misunderstanding as she was trying to help her pet dogs. After clearing up the misunderstanding, she became part of Toutaku`s faction. She usually does not show any emotion at all but is really a good-hearted person; she also appears to have a certain degree of charm and charisma about her in that whenever she asks for food from others and then eats at their presence, they immediately become enamored by her (often leading to her being given more food by the bystanders).",
