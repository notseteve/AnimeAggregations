  "description" : "Chiba is the main vocalist for BECK and is the key member that Ryuusuke needed to bring Taira into the band. Compared to Koyuki, his voice is more punk-rock and rap oriented, singing the majority of the band`s songs. Despite his looks and attitude, Chiba was the top student and head of the class in his high school. He can also seem sensitive at times. He also named the band \"Beck\" after staring at Ryuusuke`s dog for a few moments.",
