  "description" : "Manda was the personal summon of http://anidb.net/ch8603 [Orochimaru]; however, he was also summoned by http://anidb.net/ch7719 [Uchiha Sasuke]. Manda was very snobbish and prideful, believing himself as a superior to everyone. He apparently only served Orochimaru because he could not successfully defeat him, as http://anidb.net/ch8607 [Kabuto] expressed concern that Manda would turn on them if he knew Orochimaru couldn`t perform jutsu. Even in this instance, he complained about the conditions he was summoned into, and demanded that he be given a hundred human sacrifices as compensation for his help. When they lost this battle, Manda threatened Orochimaru to be prepared for a punishment during their next encounter. Manda had mutual animosity for http://anidb.net/ch12000 [Gamabunta].",
