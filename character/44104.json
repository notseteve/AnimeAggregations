  "description" : "Jeff Keane is a catcher who is recruited into the \"Memphis Bats\" during the Minor League season. He is known as a golden rookie due to his success and potential. His baseball style is reliant on player stats and exploiting their weaknesses.\nAt first, he doesn`t get along with his team members due to his anti social personality and overtaking Sander`s position as catcher, especially with Goro. However, as the team gets used to him, they start to appreciate his ability to play baseball as he increases the amount of games they win. As soon as he realizes that Goro is a clutch pitcher, he starts to rely on his ability to pitch better when the situation is more intense.",
