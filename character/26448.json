It was her who brought Yasuna the message about Yuuma`s death but her exact relation to these two isn`t explained in the anime (she is Yasuna`s childhood friend from elementary school, says the game; her full name Miyasaka Koharu is given only in the game; no dialog lines, no anime credits.)\nWhich means that she kept Yuuma`s secret about moving to London instead.",
