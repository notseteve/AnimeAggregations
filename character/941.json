  "description" : "Ninjask is a bug-type Pokémon that is the larger and stronger evolved form of Nincada. This cicada-like species is extremely fast. It constantly darts around, moving so fast that it is difficult to detect it. However, its distinctive cry is all too well heard, which led people in the Pokémon world to consider Ninjask invisible in the past. Ninjask loves to feed on tree sap. Ninjask is a difficult Pokémon to train, not only because it is hard to keep track of its location but also due to its demanding personality. Ninjask needs a competent trainer, and if it finds itself in the hands of an inexperienced person it will refuse to obey and instead cry continuously.",
