  "description" : "Santa Claus first appeared to Hayate in a dream when he was eight years old, telling him he had to work in order to live. He was Hayate`s prime source of motivation, and the sole reason he worked so hard at such a young age and onwards. Outside of Hayate`s head, he appeared as a doctor after Hayate saves Nagi from a kidnapping. In the anime, Santa takes the role of other minor characters such as a delivery man, a construction worker, a monster in a game, a waiter, Klaus`s play school evaluator, a grocery store clerk, and a garbage man. Inside Hayate`s imagination, Santa Claus looks much like Mikado.",
