  "description" : "Tsukishima Misora has blue hair and defends Japan from the air using an airplane. Her mother (and presumably her father, as well) is a diplomat, and thus is never home. As a result of this, she lives with her grandfather. Her clover pin is blue. Her transformed outfit features a pair of white-feathered wings on her back, which she can use to fly. She`s fairly mature and the type who can come up with ideas all the time but physically can`t carry them out. Misora`s also an Honors student. In the anime, she is known for ending most of her sentences with \"...I must say!\" while in the manga, she says \"Dont`cha know\" and \"If ya please\" compared to her Japanese \"arimasu.\"\nHer baton activates the Reflection Barrier.",
