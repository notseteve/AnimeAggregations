  "description" : "An Entourage AutoReiv belonging to Re-l Mayer.\nIggy contracted a \"weaponized\" version of the Cogito Virus and grew to become enraged at Re-l`s lack of regard for him. He despises Proxies and blames Vincent for taking Re-l - his sole Raison d`Être - away from him. He develops an unusual state of both loving (because she is his master and raison d`être) and hating (because she is selfish and arrogant) Re-l, and locks her up to \"protect\" her, while he attempts to kill Vincent. Re-l escapes after being attacked by an AutoReiv belonging to a Proxy she killed, and the AutoReiv pursues her. The AutoReiv goes into a self-detonation mode, and Iggy sacrifices himself to protect Re-l, leaving little more than his broken head behind (which leaves Iggy conscious to some extent). In the end, not wanting to see Iggy suffer due to the virus, Re-l shoots him and buries his head.\nSource: Wiki",
