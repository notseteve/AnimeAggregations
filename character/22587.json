  "description" : "Sparky is a Pikachu who is a Pokémon that travels with Ritchie and can be identified from most Pikachu by the long tuff of fur from the left side of its head.\nKanto Pokémon League.\nFifth Round - Vs Ash Ketchum.\nSparky was Ritchie`s third and final Pokémon in the battle and was against Ash`s Charizard which had just forced Charmander to be switched. Charizard trembled the ground with a couple of stomps making Sparky lose its balance and then blew Sparky away using a gust from its wings. Seemingly thinking Sparky was not a worthy opponent, Charizard took a nap in the middle of a battle and was eliminated. This gave Sparky the victory over Charizard and put Ritchie into round six.\nRound Six - Vs Assumpta\nBoth trainers were down to their last Pokémon and it was Ritchie`s Pikachu versus Assumpta`s Ivysaur. Ivysaur quickly charged at Pikachu who just managed to avoid the attack, however, Ivysaur used Vine Whip which swept Pikachu off of its feet. Ivysaur charged again at Pikachu who tried to halt its progress with a Thundershock but Ivysaur either dodged the attack or defended itself with its vines. Ivysaur then launched itself in the air and launched a Solarbeam attack followed by a tackle attack which Pikachu could not recover from and eliminated Ritchie from the competition.",
