  "description" : "Legato Bluesummers is a man who devotes himself to Knives, and makes it his main goal to have Vash experience eternal pain and suffering. He serves directly under Knives, which also gives him command of the Gung-Ho Guns. In the manga, he is originally a slave who Knives accidentally saves while wiping out a town. Legato pledges to serve Knives, who gives him his name. During his time as a slave, he weaved thousands of special metal threads into his medulla oblongata. They are dispensed out of a skull-shaped emblem attached to his left arm. When released, the threads transmit electricity to control his victim`s muscles over. The threads themselves are only a few molecules thick and able to take over an entire town with ease.",
