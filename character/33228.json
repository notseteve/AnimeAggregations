  "description" : "Another Saint revived by Eris in a new body. He has a personality similar to Pegasus Seiya, but Maya would fight to the death if it meant winning. He proves this when he faces Seiya, to first talk, and then attack with all his strength. Unfortunately, he is no match for Seiya, but one of the arrows from his Phantom Arrow Express attack makes it through Seiya`s defenses. Seiya removes the arrow with ease and tries to get Maya to tell where Saori is, but leaves when Maya does not respond. Maya says in his last breath that the arrow is actually poisonous, and only one shot is enough to remove the five senses.",
