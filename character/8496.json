  "description" : "Throne Zwei is a melee combat mobile suit that uses its GN Fangs as an offensive guile. When engaging mass amount of units, the GN Fangs would be used to cause distractiong so the Throne Zwei could take advantage of the situation by shooting and/or cutting through enemy suits with its GN Buster Sword. Six GN Fangs are often used and a pair are reserved, but should all of them be destroyed; the pilot is forced into melee combat. While the suit is designed for melee combat (reflective of Micheal`s combat style), its combat potential is dramatically reduced when engaging opponents without its GN Fangs, the same applies for high speed combat.",
