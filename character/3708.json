  "description" : "A very powerful magician, and one of Hyaweh`s roommates. His spells are so powerful that even he himself cannot control the power of it. It is worth noting that he was taught magic before he entered the academy by a neighbour. He has trained for five years in order to learn to control the power of his spells, with no success. Since he is afraid that the power of the spells would hurt those around him, he tries to isolate himself from others.",
