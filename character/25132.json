  "description" : "Shiina Yuya is a young woman who makes a living as a professional bounty hunter in order to track down her brother`s killer, the \"Man with the Scar on His Back\". She uses a three barreled gun and small daggers as defensive weapons. Yuya is actually an orphan found by her \"brother\", Nozomu, and raised by him as an adoptive sister. He was Sakuya`s biological brother. Unlike many of the characters, Yuya is a normal human without any powers, despite the former Crimson King suspecting she can see the future later in the story.",
