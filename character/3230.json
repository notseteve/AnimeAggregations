  "description" : "Deedlit is a high elf who comes from the Forest of No Return, her peoples` homeland, where they reside in solitude.\nDeedlit is a special figure among her race because she is the last high elf to be born within the last 1,000 years, being just about 160 years old. She is considered, as a result of her rare status, to be the last hope for the high elven people to prosper and flourish once more. She received the best education from her mentors in her homeland, including how to wield a blade, as well as how to cast shaman magic to harness the power of spirits.\nDeedlit was restless in her homeland, and decided that staying there was simply a very slow path to extinction. Because of that, she left the forest, seeking out the \"Tree of Truth\", a means to find out how to help her people to become something more than what they are in their reserved state. She believes she has found it in the form of Parn.\n(Wikipedia)",
