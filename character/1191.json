  "description" : "Rebecca - or Revy as she prefers others to call herself - is not the type of person anyone would want to cross. A member of the Lagoon Company, she is the one Dutch and the others turn to if they want someone dead really fast (there are rumors she committed several unsolved murders in New York City). She has an almost-passionate zeal for killing, and is often seen grinning maniacally during a shoot-out. Dutch once commented that Revy`s personality is similar to Charles Whitman`s, the University of Texas sniper who went on a shooting rampage after murdering his mother in 1965.\nRevy earned the nickname \"Two-Hand\" because of her ability to shoot accurately with a gun in each hand... namely her customized chrome-plated Berettas. She also has a knack of being able to avoid bullets that are fired at her... traits the Chinese American picked up while surviving the mean streets of New York City before she made her way to Roanapur. She is also well-versed in other firearms, which range from grenade launchers to heavy sniper rifles.\nRevy was the one responsible for making the decision of taking Rock hostage in the hopes of collecting ransom. And although she keeps making the promise of killing him one day, Revy cares deeply for the guy, and often saves him when the going gets tough. She is also a constant smoker, drinks heavily and swears a lot... mostly at Rock, if not just for not wearing the Hawaiian-print she bought him.",
