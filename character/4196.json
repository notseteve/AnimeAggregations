  "description" : "Eufinley`s covenant spirit. On the day they meet, Yardio quickly tried to make a covenant by kissing her, but received a punch in his face instead. He is a laid back character in contrast to the more serious Eufinley. He also likes to fight, and his power level is above most four winged spirits. Unlike Corti, Yardio is more blatant in showing that he likes Eufinley.",
