  "description" : "Dawn received her Cyndaquil as an egg after she defeated Kotone in a battle during the Johto Festa in Suiren Town. Team Rocket noticed the egg while they were flying away and Meowth used his extender arm to capture the egg.\nWhile escaping from a wild Ursaring, James noticed that the egg was glowing, signifying that it was close to hatching. Dawn was able to recover the egg in time to watch it hatch.\nDawn`s Cyndaquil didn`t get along with her Pilpup just after it hatched as they fought a lot.",
