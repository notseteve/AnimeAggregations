  "description" : "Tonton is http://anidb.net/ch8606 [Tsunade]`s pet pig, often kept in the care of http://anidb.net/ch8613 [Shizune]. She does not speak in any human language, but still manages to get her point across by whining in her own unique tone (a \"buhi\" or \"oink\" depending on the language). It seems that Tsunade and Shizune are able to understand what Tonton is trying to say. Tonton`s nose also seems adept at tracking things, such so that http://anidb.net/ch10966 [Pakkun] has some familiarity with her.",
