  "description" : "Cleao Everlasting is the tomboyish, feisty main female lead. Her father had inherited the Sword of Balthanders, and Orphen needed the sword. She accompanies him on his journey, allowing him to take the sword (as it was just an ornament to her, knowing nothing of its power), claiming that she is only coming to \"make sure he doesn`t harm her investment.\" She and Orphen fight quite a bit - mainly silly, funny fights. As the series goes on, her feelings for him grow, and she shows it, too. (This fact is played up more in the second series, when Cleao and Orphen have somehow sleepwalked into the bed of the other.) When they met up with Stephanie, Orphen`s old partner, Cleao got very jealous. She also got rather angry whenever Orphen would talk about Azalie (this is when they knew nothing beyond `Azalie is someone who Orphen wants to help`).",
