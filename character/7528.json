  "description" : "Hasegawa Sora is a member of the http://anidb.net/ch7566 [Nekomi Tech Motor Club]. A rather timid, mousy girl, she looks up to http://anidb.net/ch2215 [Keiichi] and http://anidb.net/ch2234 [Belldandy]. Throughout the series, the two help her overcome her lack of confidence and believe in herself. When Keiichi leaves to work for http://anidb.net/ch15327 [Chihiro]`s company Whirlwind, he bestows the directorship of the Motor Club to her. She accepts the position, despite the fact that previous clubs that were led by her all collapsed (though not necessarily by her fault). Every time she gets drunk, she whines to Keiichi about how people think she is a middle school student, flashing her chest to show she is growing breasts to him. She has a crush on http://anidb.net/ch15324 [Aoshima Toshiyuki].",
