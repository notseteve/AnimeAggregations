  "description" : "Helen is ranked #22. Her special power is to stretch her arms to extreme lengths to attack at range or bind her opponents. Helen is partially Awakened, but has reverted to her human state. She seems to have a large appetite for a Claymore and can often be seen eating an apple. She is also the only Claymore seen eating and drinking for pleasure. Helen is hot tempered and aggressive. Her mouthy and sometimes insensitive nature means that she can appear to be something of a bully. She is Deneve`s constant companion. Deneve commented that she is \"always the troublemaker.\" However, Helen is honest and cares fiercely for her friends.",
