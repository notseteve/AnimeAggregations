He died on his bike in an accident and was then transferred into the Gantz room.\nHe appears in the room before the Onion Alien mission, and dies during that first mission after getting both his arms cut off by the boss alien. While dying, he dreams that this was all a fake TV show, and that everyone was still alive and well. Then, he soon realizes that this is not fake, screaming in horror when he sees an arm gone. He then bleeds to death, still clinging on to the hope that he`ll be transferred back to the Gantz room. He`s been dead ever since.\nHe seemed like a friendly guy. Asking the Gantzers their names and stories. But nothing from his personal life is known, aside from his job. He wears glasses and a suit.",
