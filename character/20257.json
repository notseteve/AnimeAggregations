  "description" : "Julia was a kind woman who gave up her happiness for the sake of others. Her father remarked that she, like her ancestors, had inherited the trait of being mischievous, but she often sacrificed herself for other people. Many around her, such as Gisela and Celi, have commented that Julia pushed herself over the limit when trying to help people on the battlefield, which eventually resulted in her death. Gisela was one who remained by Julia`s side in during the latter`s final moments.",
