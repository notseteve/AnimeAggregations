  "description" : "Snorunt live in icy dark caves and enjoys crying out to hear its own echo. Its diet consists solely of snow and ice. Old folklore claims that a house visited by Snorunt is sure to prosper for many generations to come. It generally moves in groups of five Snorunt, and they hide away during the hot seasons of Summer and Spring. Being an Ice-type, Snorunt can withstand temperatures of up to negative 150 degrees. Also, it has the peculiar ability to make Winter come early. A Snorunt typically evolves into a Glalie at level 42, but if a Snorunt is female and a player uses a Dawn Stone on it, it will evolve into a Froslass.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Snorunt is Ash Ketchum`s fifth Pokémon from the Hoenn region. It has a powerful Ice Beam, though this is hindered by Snorunt`s bad aim. Because of this, Ash constantly trains it to try and improve its use of the technique. Snorunt eventually evolves into Glalie while fighting Team Rocket.",
