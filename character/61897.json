  "description" : "Arakune is a black blob-like creature with a white mask who formerly worked alongside Tager and Litchi in Sector Seven. After an attempt to study the Boundary, he became what he is today, now housing innumerable insects with his now-blobby body and thriving on knowledge. His horrible condition has rendered him virtually insane and lacking any reliable memory, as well as distorting his speech to near incoherency.\nSource: Wiki",
