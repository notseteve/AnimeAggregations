  "description" : "Heinrich von KÃ¼mmel was a cousin to http://anidb.net/ch199 [Hildegard von Mariendorf]. Due to his chronically (indeed, terminally) poor health, he seemed to have been bed-ridden for most or all of his life, thus giving him the appearance of a man well older than he actually was. Heinrich held the title of Baron, though how powerful he was in the court of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] must surely have been negligible due to his inability to actually participate in any obvious manner.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
