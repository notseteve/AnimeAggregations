  "description" : "A sadomasochistic woman who relishes physical pains in a fight as pleasures, before joining the Chess, Candice was a mercenary officer, and was feared by many for her violent and abusing personality. After a defeat to Phantom, however, Candice fell in love with Phantom and followed him. Though this remains largely an unreciprocal passion, Candice still endeavours to undertake many demanding tasks (e.g. taking on powerful enemies) to get Phantom`s commends, and is resolute to obliterate whoever obstructs his way.\nCandice first appeared during Phantom`s revival and informed him that Queen Diana summoned him. During the Chess Pieces` war campaign, Candice single-handedly defeats the soldiers at Castle Geirelulu using Gorgon to turn them into stone. Candice reappeared during the 5th Round of the War Games and fought to a draw with Jack. After Phantom`s defeat, Candice accompanies Phantom to Lestava`s castle, and in the manga witnesses his death while he rests on his throne. In the anime Candice tries to help him escape from the pursuit by Team MÃ„R in the end of the Ghost Chess attack. Though this ends unsuccessfully, it deeply touches Phantom and partly lets him die in peace, knowing he after all isn`t so hated. Her last appearance is with the revived Rolan, visiting Phantom`s grave.",
