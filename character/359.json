  "description" : "Hypno is a humanoid creature with a fur covering its neck, and always carrying its favorite pendulum in its hand, which it uses to put others to sleep. The name \"Hypno\" originates from the word \"hypnosis\", as Hypno hypnotizes foes with its pendulum.\nHypno is a curiously sinister Pokémon that puts other Pokémon and people to sleep. It does so by swinging the pendulum, which it carries in its hand all the time. When hunting for prey, it will polish the mysterious pendulum.\nEating the dreams of its foes is another sinister ability of Hypno. However, stomach pains will ail Hypno if it eats a nightmare. At dusk, some Hypno will appear near schools and less-traveled roads. This may be to scare children and travelers at night and hypnotize them. In fact, there was once an incident where Hypno hypnotized and kidnapped a child.\nIt is possible that Hypno never sleeps, as evident by its Insomnia ability. Instead of sleeping, it probably energizes itself with meditation and by eating the dreams of those it puts to sleep. Hypno`s menacing and semi-parted eyelids look sleep deprived.",
