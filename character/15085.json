  "description" : "While the crew of the Vulture ship Freeden were aiding in the defense of the People`s Republic of Estard against an invasion by the New United Nations Earth, Witz Sou`s GW-9800 Gundam Airmaster was heavily damaged during an intense dogfight against the New UNE`s superior NRMA-006 Gadeel mobile armors. After the battle, the Estard government offered to assist the Freeden crew with their repairs and supplies, and Witz accepted the offer. Kidd Salsamille, the Freeden`s young mobile suit mechanic, worked side-by-side with engineers in the Estard military to rebuilt Witz`s trashed mobile suit. The result was the GW-9800-B Gundam Airmaster Burst, sporting not only a snazzy new blue-on-white paint job, but an increase in armor and firepower. The original Airmaster`s nose vulcan guns were replaced with beam guns, and a pair of additional beam cannons were mounted on each wing. Although the Airmaster Burst was heavier than its original form, speed and maneuverability were not sacrificed, as additional jets were also installed in the wings to compensate for the extra bulk as well as improve performance. With these improvements, Witz`s reborn Airmaster Burst was more than capable of holding its own against the New UNE`s Gadeels and other aerial combat units.",
