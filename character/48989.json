  "description" : "A potent attack aircraft, the Avenger II typically operates from a naval carrier, delivering large bombing payloads upon the enemy. Deployed in the United Nations War, the craft has enjoyed a moderate service life and continued operations until the end of Space War One. The Avenger II is a two-seater aircraft and has several large, under-wing racks for carrying dozens of bombs and even possesses limited anti-aircraft weaponry in the form of two air-to-air missiles under either engine nacelle. Though sometimes seen in light hull colors, the Avenger II was most often recognized in a dark gray hull color.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/avengerii.htm",
