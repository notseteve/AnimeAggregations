  "description" : "Kyoko is Hajiki`s widowed mother. She works in a restaurant until all hours of the night to support her family.\nKyoko is a big woman, and like most single mothers, she has no problem punishing her degenerate son for skipping school and falling asleep in class.\nShe is a good woman though, constantly worrying about her children, especially Hajiki, and trying to do the best she can for them. She fusses about his eating, his school attendance and even yells at his boss when he disappears for hiding him and trying to pretend she`s stupid.\nLate in the show, she takes Takumi on as an apprentice of sorts to teach him to cook, and in the process teaches him that all people, bad or good, should not be judged, but should be treated well.\nSource: wiki",
