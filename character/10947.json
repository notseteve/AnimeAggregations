  "description" : "Gihren is the oldest of Degwin Zabi`s children, and the commander-in-chief of the Zeon military. With an IQ of 240, plenty of charisma, and a gift for rousing speeches, Gihren has been able to seize the reins of power and reduce his father to little more than a figurehead. To this intellectual monster, exterminating half the human race in this ferocious war has been just a stepping-stone to eventual world domination.",
