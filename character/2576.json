  "description" : "Teresa was the strongest Claymore of her generation. She was famously known as Teresa of the Faint Smile for effortlessly slaying enemies with a faint smile on her face.\nAs a Claymore, Teresa is a cold-blooded killer who cares for no one, only helping villages because she is ordered to. She is also solitary and rarely has contact with any of the other Claymores in the organisation (she was surprised when Rosemary sent her a Black Card). She also keeps secrets from her handlers, and severely distrusts the organisation. This changes when Teresa saves a young girl who had been kept as a prisoner and toy of a Yoma. The girl then follows her on her journeys. She is initially extremely irritated by this girl tagging along wherever she goes, but eventually grows fond of her. Teresa gives the girl the name Clare, after the twin goddesses, Teresa and Clare, and is surprised to find out that it was actually Clare`s real name. As they travel together, Clare awakens Teresa`s lost compassion.",
