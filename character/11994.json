  "description" : "Konan is the only female ninja in http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki]. As such, Kishimoto originally wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being a partner of http://anidb.net/ch12003 [Nagato], Konan was also a pupil under http://anidb.net/ch7213 [Jiraiya] after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure`s many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under http://anidb.net/ch11993 [Pain], she is referred to by villagers of http://anidb.net/ch12202 [Amegakure] as \"God`s angel\". Though she worries for Nagato as he was straining himself from having his Pains battle http://anidb.net/ch226 [Naruto], she respects his wishes to stand aside so that he and Naruto might meet face to face. While under Jiraiya, Konan learned to take advantage of her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. However, Konan`s abilities are restricted when the paper is wet; since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness. After Nagato`s death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and leaves the organization, pledging the support of Amegakure to Naruto and http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konoha].",
