  "description" : "Daughter of St. Mihailov`s last dean and currently best friend and roommate of Oribe Mafuyu, Tomo is her exact opposite, both physically and mentally: she herself is very childish and na√Øve, and while having the largest bust of the whole female cast so far, she is physically weak. Tomo is the spitting image of Sasha`s original protector, Olja, which explains why he took so willingly the role of Tomo`s guardian, much to Mafuyu`s chagrin. Also, sometimes an upside down Eastern Cross (with its third slab being a scar), the symbol of the Adepts, appears between her breasts. This is later revealed to be the presence of the Qwaser of Gold, which apparently inhabits Tomo`s body and, as itself stated, is slowly draining her of her life, which is why she has to replenish herself through Teresa`s Soma.",
