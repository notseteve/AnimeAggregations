  "description" : "Daughter of St. Mihailov`s last dean and currently best friend and roommate of Oribe Mafuyu, Tomo is her exact opposite, both physically and mentally: she herself is very childish and naïve, and while having the largest bust of the whole female cast so far, she is physically weak. Tomo is the spitting image of Sasha`s original protector, Olja, which explains why he took so willingly the role of Tomo`s guardian, much to Mafuyu`s chagrin. Also, sometimes an upside down Eastern Cross (with its third slab being a scar), the symbol of the Adepts, appears between her breasts. This is later revealed to be the presence of the Qwaser of Gold, which apparently inhabits Tomo`s body and, as itself stated, is slowly draining her of her life, which is why she has to replenish herself through Teresa`s Soma.",
