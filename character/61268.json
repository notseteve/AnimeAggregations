  "description" : "Honedge (ヒトツキ), the Sword Pokémon, is a ghost that has possessed an ancient sword. It uses the blue tassel on its hilt as a hand and holds its own sheath in battle. It should be noted that Steel type Pokémon are no longer resistant to damage from Dark-type attacks, making this Pokémon and its evolutions vulnerable to Dark-type attacks such as Bite and Dark Pulse as well as Fire-type and Ground-type strikes (Fighting type moves have no effect as it is a Ghost-type).",
