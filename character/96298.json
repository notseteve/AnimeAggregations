  "description" : "Chrysanthemum is the 26th Plantation.\nWhen the 13th Plantation, http://anidb.net/ch96297 [Cerasus], lost a significant amount of energy during the Mohorovic-class Klaxosaur`s attack, it was set to meet with nearby 36th Plantation to resupply its magma energy stockpile through a process known as \"kissing\". Like every other plantation, it houses a city inside.\nAfter the first battle of Gran Crevasse, 26th Plantation was destroyed and all inhabitants died, including all Franxx pilots.\nSource: Darling in the Franxx Wiki",
