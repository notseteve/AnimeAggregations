  "description" : "Hebidayu is a youkai who looks like a scaly humanoid with a snake`s head who can elongate his neck or turn into a large snake. Though he exchanged sakazuki with http://anidb.net/ch17495 [Zen], he claimed that he only followed Zen because he was the easiest ride to the top. After Zen met with http://anidb.net/ch15458 [Rikuo] and learned that the latter had no intention of succeeding http://anidb.net/ch17493 [Nurarihyon]`s position, Hebidayu turned against him. Along with several like-minded subordinates, he burned down the Zen Sect`s house and tried to kill Zen, but was defeated and sliced in half by http://anidb.net/ch17492 [\"Night\" Rikuo].",
