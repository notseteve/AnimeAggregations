  "description" : "Formerly a Saint apprentice under Ophiuchus Shaina. During the final fight for the Pegasus Cloth and the status of Saint, Seiya cut off one of his ears, and he hated Seiya for it ever since. Cassios had great respect and affection toward Shaina; however, he realizes that Shaina had affection toward Seiya. Motivated by this, he takes Seiya`s place and dies during the fight with Leo Aiolia in order to wake the Leo Gold Saint from the control of Saga`s Dellusional Demon`s Emperor Fist.\nSource: Wikipedia",
