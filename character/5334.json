  "description" : "The Dark Elf Princess of Shurifon and a member of the Junrei Guard. While she initially shows a very serious and sober personality, it is later revealed that her personality shifts based on the time of day. At certain times-such as in the early morning-she has a much more innocent and girlish personality. The reason for this is because her kind were summoned by the ancients, and her time of weakness shows that her people have not yet fully stabilized in this world. Initially she admires Kenshi`s wilderness skills, but grows to develop a romantic interest in him, even to go as far as too kiss him and then confess (even her own father suggests she should marry him). When not dealing with school-related tasks, she is nearly always accompanied by two male retainers. Her Seikijin is green and brown armed with a crossbow, and has the ability to generate the Dark Elf Field, a powerful force field that can repel any enemy that comes in range. However, using the field is extremely taxing on the user`s body.",
