  "description" : "Miyako is the second member of the Powerpuff Girls Z team. She transforms using the phrase \"Rolling Bubbles\" and uses a bubble wand staff as a weapon. In comparison to the original Bubbles, who was known for being the most childish of the girls, Miyako is quite mature, as she was the most successful at being a mother to Ken, but she`s the ditziest member of the three, often appearing a bit clueless, and doesn`t seem to understand her powers completely, along with a few other things. She is the only member of the girls who, like some villains, end a few sentences with a phrase. Her phrase is desu wa. She is very friendly and polite, as she always uses honorifics at the end of names, although she too can be angered when provoked and is not above pretending to cry to get what she wants. Trendy and stylish, Bubbles enjoys shopping and fashion the most. Although she is popular with the boys at school, she already has feelings for Takaaki (Taka-chan), a boy who saved her from bullies when she was six who she later visits in the hospital everyday. She also uses curlers (3 balls on each pigtail) when going to bed. Miyako remains typified, however, by the original`s compassion, gentleness and innocence, as well as her love of animals and her favorite doll, Octi. She lives with only her grandmother. Her parents live in Kyoto. She is represented by bubbles. She dreams of being a fashion designer or model in the future.",
