  "description" : "Shouko is Misaki`s aunt and Shuuko`s younger sister. She`s 26 years old. She demands that Misaki and her friends call her \"Miss Shouko\" instead of \"aunt\" (\"obasan\" in Japanese) because she is still \"an attractive young newscaster.\" She often covers Angelic Layer events for the local news station that she works for. Misaki lives with Shouko when she moves to Tokyo.\nHer hairstyle bears a resemblance to that of Shimizu Takako in Chobits.",
