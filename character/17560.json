  "description" : "A boy who loves to draw. His most precious possessions are a paint set and a drawing of his family, both of which were given to him by his grandfather who was also an artist. Shouta`s dream was to become an artist, but his parents constantly argued over whether or not this was a good choice for him. The only one who supported him was his grandfather who later passed away.\nHe could never see his Shugo Chara, Kuuta, because his dream became weak, and because of this Kuuta`s appearance is very transparent. However, in his grandfather`s sketchbook there is a drawing of Kuuta.",
