  "description" : "Itsuki Takeuchi is http://anidb.net/ch9259 [Takumi]`s best friend; he provides the comic relief in the series, and is generally quite loud and obnoxious. Itsuki works part-time at a gas station with Takumi and http://anidb.net/ch9273 [Iketani]; Itsuki plans to use the money he earns to buy an AE86 Corolla Levin (to complement Takumi`s AE86 Trueno) but mistakenly buys an inferior (less power, poor brakes, less chassis breaking, and worse suspension) AE85.",
