  "description" : "Jinzouningen 16 Gou (Android #16 in the English adaptations) is a large cyborg with red hair and a green armor. Unlike other jinzouningen, he is gentle by nature, a fact that deemed him a failure in http://anidb.net/ch18381 [Dr. Gero]`s eyes. He was programmed with the sole objective of killing http://anidb.net/ch2103 [Son Gokuu]. He was awakened by http://anidb.net/ch19620 [Jinzouningen 17 Gou] and http://anidb.net/ch19619 [Jinzouningen 18 Gou], much to Gero`s dismay. While he was much stronger than the two, he still took orders from the duo.\nOn a Q&A with mangaka http://anidb.net/cr1902 [Toriyama Akira] published April 4th, 2014, it was revealed that Jinzouningen 16 Gou was modeled after Dr. Gero`s own son who died young long ago. He was a high-ranking soldier in the Red Ribbon Army, but he was felled by an enemy bullet. Having a special place in his heart for his own child, Gero gave No. 16 great power and a fearsome explosive mechanism, but not wanting him to be destroyed in battle if possible, he gave him a gentle personality, which caused No. 16 to become a failure.\nHe helped Jinzouningen 18 Gou escape from http://anidb.net/ch22205 [Cell], and watched the Cell Games after she was absorbed, vowing to stop Cell. His body is destroyed by http://anidb.net/ch24822 [Cell], however, his head survives and requests that http://anidb.net/ch12210 [Mr. Satan] throw him over to the fight, to help http://anidb.net/ch39296 [Gohan] control himself. Cell completely destroys him after he gets his word in, crushing his head and pushing Gohan over the edge to Super Saiyan 2. In http://anidb.net/ch13302 [Future Trunks]` timeline, Jinzouningen 16 Gou was never activated.",
