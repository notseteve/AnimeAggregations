  "description" : "Jil`s half brother; he is a skilled archer and also notably known as \"Neeba the Dragon Slayer.\" Neeba is far more serious and competent than Jil is, and has little-to-no faith in his brother`s potential as a climber (in episode 10, he goes so far as to tell him point blank that he will never defeat Druaga). He has the most knowledge of the tower out of any of the main characters. He doesn`t hesitate for a second about using his friends to do what he wants. His motivation for climbing the tower remains unknown.",
