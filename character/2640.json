  "description" : "Kaneru is an office lady in her twenties who enjoys drawing doujinshi as her hobby, but has poor skills in drawing and creating them. Najimi declares her to be a rival after they both fare poorly in sales at the Comic Market. Tsuyuri artificially encourages this rivalry in the belief that it will make Najimi a better artist and author. Kaneru also misinterprets Justice`s and Junichirou`s relationship not as antagonistic over Najimi, but a yaoi love affair.",
