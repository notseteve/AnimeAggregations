  "description" : "Kokonoe is Tager`s superior at Sector Seven, Lotte (who became Arakune) and Litchi`s former employer and Jubei and Nine`s daughter. She is a half-beastkin, two of the Six Heroes, though she shows unexplained disdain for this fact, supposedly \"staying angry for weeks\" when Jubei is mentioned. Kokonoe is a rather serious and cynical woman with no regard for emotions, and always strives for Tager to complete his missions without fail; however, she can on rare occasions be quite personable, mostly around her creations. She`s displayed and perceived as cranky most of the time. She has a deep hatred for Terumi, because he killed her mother, Nine. She and Taokaka possess a few similar personality traits, something that most note as `more in common than they realize`, due to their impatient nature and short attention span. She is also the host of the `Help Me, Professor Kokonoe!` comedy segments.",
