  "description" : "In the My-Otome anime series, Mai Tohika is a much more relaxed and carefree person (much to Natsuki`s consternation), but still has good cooking skills. Despite her attitude, she is knowledgeable about Otome and political affairs, due to her status as a princess.\nNobody knew of this since she herself had left her homeland without anyone`s knowledge. Keeping it a secret while trying to get admitted into Garderobe, she was luckily found by a wealthy family in the area, who agreed to also sponsor her tuition. She was given the rank of #1 Coral and was roomed alongside the #2 Coral - Natsuki Kruger, who explained much of the Otome system to Mai. The two became fast friends during their time together, with Mai noticeably helping Natsuki become the Room Attendant of Shizuru Viola, the #1 Pearl at that time, despite the stiff competition for that particular role. In battle, she was nearly undefeatable, a streak that continued well into her Pearl year.\nWhen she became a Pearl, Mai claimed the young Sara Gallagher as her Room Attendant. At graduation, she faced a dilemma that rapidly multiplied itself when the family that was sponsoring her made their desire known that they wanted her to come work as their family`s Otome. She agreed on the spot but she was then told that she was chosen, along with Natsuki, to become one of the Five Columns of Garderobe. She also remembered the real reason why she wanted to become an Otome was to help her younger brother, Takumi, who was to become the leader of Zipang. Not knowing what else to do, she took an insanely long `walk to clear her head` and fell into one of Mikoto`s traps, where her GEM was eaten and formed an unofficial contract between them.",
