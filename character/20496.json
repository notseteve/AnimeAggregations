  "description" : "Hanzou is seventeen and Iroha`s subordinate in the plot to kill Koushi. Since Iroha saved his life one day, he has followed her orders closely. The two of them share a relationship like Koushi and Momoko in that it could be likened to a dog and its master, although Iroha appreciates Hanzou from the start; he is the only member of her family`s once feared yakuza legion that has remained at her side. This is because he admires her greatly and considers her example an inspiration to improve himself. It is also quite likely that he has become romantically infatuated with Iroha. Unfortunately for him, Iroha states publicly that she considers him to be like a brother to her and considers the idea of a romantic relationship between them impossible.",
