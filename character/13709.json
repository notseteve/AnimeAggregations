  "description" : "\"Fragments\" originating from the Emerald Tablet. It is said that using the Emerald Tablet it becomes possible to attain god`s wisdom and infinite magical power.\nBecause of the great power within, the Tablet was broken in the past into 12 fragments and scattered throughout the worlds thus becoming lost forever.\nLiselotte Wreckmeister tried to collect all of the fragments but even for her it was only possible to collect five of them within the span of 700 years.\nAfter her defeat by the hands of George of the Rainbow (Avaritia) and the other saints, the piece she collected was broken into seven fragments, the Fragments of Nothingness, five of which are found in Kakeru`s friends, with Kakeru himself holding the Eye of Aion, and the remaining two being embedded in Shiori and Liselotte/Lisette herself.\nThe Black Knights, who are in reality saints of Index, target the group to eliminate the threat of the fragments being collected once again.",
