  "description" : "Excalibur is the legendary sword used by heroes and kings. He has a great power that is unmatched by any other weapon. Anyone can use Excalibur, even without matching his soul resonance. Unfortunately there are few who can put up with Excalibur`s personality. He has an incredible ego, and tends to go on long rants that seem to go nowhere. In exchange for his help, Excalibur demands his meister to perform a list of one thousand tasks (such as listening to Excalibur`s daily five-hour recital sessions). Unlike his weapon form Excalibur`s humanoid form is far from elegant, looking like a cartoonish anthropomorphic creature with a very long snout, dressed in a white suit and top hat (though wearing no pants) and carrying a cane. Excalibur often uses the word \"fool\", usually to stop other people talking and draw attention back to him.",
