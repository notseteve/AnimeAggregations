  "description" : "She is Haruto`s friend since childhood. She has a cheerful personality, but according to Haruto, she often hides her feelings from others. As a child she was a tomboy, often getting into fights because her father was Russian and she inherited his blue eyes and light hair. Haruto and Takashi take her side in childhood and the three become inseparable friends. She is part of the tennis club along with Yuzuki. She was upset that Haruto decided to go to Tokyo for Yuzuki at first, but got over it later. She may also have romantic feelings for him since she kissed him as a going away present and told him to think of it if he was lonely. Akari goes to Seijo University with Haruto, Asuka, Nanami, Takashi and Kiyomi. After not even a year in college, she feels homesick and decides to move back to Hiroshima to work in her dad`s company. During this time she grew close to Nanami`s brother, Narumi, eventually leading to them going out and their engagement. When she briefly returns to Tokyo to visit, she informs Haruto of it, but also, having a case of cold feet, tries to make love to him, feeling it would be the only way she could move on from her old feelings for Haruto, but Haruto stops her.",
