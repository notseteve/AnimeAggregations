  "description" : "Kouyama Mitsuki is a 12-year-old girl who dreams of becoming a pop singer but a tumor in her vocal cords restricts her ability to sing. She is an orphan who grew up in an orphanage, then later went to live with her strict grandmother, Fuzuki, who forbid her from singing. When Mitsuki learned that she would die if her vocal cords were not removed, she refused the surgery, saying that she would rather die than not be able to sing. With Takuto`s help, she can transform into Fullmoon, a 16-year-old pop idol, completely free of cancer and able to sing. As Fullmoon, she is discovered by Seed Records during an audition and releases several singles in both the manga and anime; the anime ending theme songs are all supposedly sung by her. Mitsuki chooses the stage name Fullmoon both because mitsuki means \"full moon\" in Japanese and because her childhood friend, Sakurai Eichi, wants to become an astronomer and the name reminds her of him.\nMitsuki wants to become a singer because she wants to tell Eichi that she loves him.\nHowever, the shinigami eventually discover that Eichi is dead. In the manga, they realise that Mitsuki knew all along; in the anime, Mitsuki learns of his death during a trip to America. Both the manga and anime revolve around Mitsuki dealing with Eichi`s death, as well as her eventual feelings for Takuto.\nMitsuki`s corkscrew hairstyle is taken from Ai Kago from the group Morning Musume. Mitsuki herself is modeled on one of Arina Tanemura`s assistants, Airi Teito.\nHer birthday in the manga is May 12 and in the anime April 4.",
