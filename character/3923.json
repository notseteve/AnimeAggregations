  "description" : "* Abilities: Change his whistle (the sound, not the object) into a laser, change fans/cards/disks (menko) into buzzsaws.\nThe buzzsaw can only be avoided by jumping. Dodging it will only result in it following the target. This is used in combination with the laser so that when they jump from the buzzsaw, they are easy targets for the laser.\nHe was given powers by two King of the Celestial World Candidates who were in cahoots with each other, but changed their minds after seeing Robert in action.\nIn the Japanese version, he has a speech impediment that often causes him to elongate his pronunciation of the consonant \"s,\" but in the American dub he instead appends \"like\" to nearly each sentence he utters. Neither of these carries over into the English translation of the manga.\nMyojin fits the same personality type as most of the other Ten members, seeing friendship as weakness and showing no mercy. This makes for a very hard character shift from his goofy simpleton looks. Myojin was the one who recruited Ueki to join Robert`s Ten. Ueki retires him with Masshu.",
