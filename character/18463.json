  "description" : "Katsuragi Keima is the primary protagonist of the story, a 17-year-old high school student attending Maijima High School Academy. He is known as \"The Capturing God (落とし神, Otoshi-gami)\" in the gaming world for his legendary skills in \"capturing\" any girls in dating sims. But ironically, he is called otamegane (a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku and megane-\"glasses\"). At the start of the series, Keima becomes a collaborator for catching runaway spirits when he replies to an e-mail requesting his help to \"capture\" girls without knowing it was a contract from Hell, to which Elsee appeared and asked for his aid to \"capture\" girls in real-life. For each individual of the \"Capture Targets\"—a girl with the runaway spirit in her—Keima utilizes his analytical skills and experiences from dating sims to capture them. Whenever he isn`t capturing runaway spirits, he is almost always seen playing video games on his PFP (a parody of Sony`s PSP). Also, despite the fact he even plays video games in class, he is still at the top of class in every subject. As the story progresses, his perspective of the \"real world\" girls becomes different.",
