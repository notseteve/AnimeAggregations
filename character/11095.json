  "description" : "This high-performance version of the Zaku II is designed exclusively for squadron commanders and veteran pilots. Although it has more powerful thrusters and a greater propellant supply than the standard Zaku II, the only external difference is the communications antenna on its forehead. Lieutenant Commander Char Aznable - the famous \"Red Comet\" - pilots this commander`s version of the Zaku II, painted in his trademark colors.",
