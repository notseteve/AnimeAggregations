  "description" : "Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan was sent out to battle against Ash`s Oshawott at a Raimon Gym battlefield that was separate to the main battlefield used by Elesa for her gym matches. Elesa refereed the match between the two. Bianca`s Father nicknamed his Hihidaruma `Red Flash` based off his own nickname, the \"Red Shooting Star\".\nAsh`s Oshawott came out of its ball as it wanted to battle against Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan and Ash thought that it would be okay because it had a type advantage being a water Pok√©mon. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Ash`s Oshawott did manage to land an Aqua Jet. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out.",
