  "description" : "Elder sister of Kochiya Sanae. Unlike her sister, she didn`t inherit the spiritual power to see and interact with gods, and thus felt out of place in the very religious Kochiya clan.\nBecause of that, she left home and moved to an university in Yokohama right after high school to stay away from the family.\nWhen she finally came back home, Sanae already moved to Gensokyo and people`s memories about Sanae started to fade away.",
