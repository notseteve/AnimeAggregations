  "description" : "She was Maron`s past self. She is the real Jeanne, not Maron`s Jeanne form. She was a strong willed woman who looks to the future. She was in love with Noin. The day before her trial, she lost her purity to a guard who was possessed by a demon. When she dies, the holy power within her set the town people free from the demons. When Maron and Noin went into the past, instead of Jeanne`s power releasing the townspeople, she gave Maron her power. Maron was able to transform at the expense of Jeanne`s death. Maron released her ashes to the air to be reborn again.",
