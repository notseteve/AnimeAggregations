  "description" : "Originally from the planet Gastogal, Oldna Poseidal is the main antagonist of the show, having taken over all 5 planets of the Pentagona system. The mysterious Poseidal rarely appears in public and when so often appears via hologram. Through the power of bio-relation she has eternal youth and has the ability to control others, such as Quwasan Olibee.\n\nIn reality, \"Poseidal\" is Mian Ku Ha Attsher, a former Temple Knight of the true Poseidal, who hides under the name Amandara Kamandara. Having fallen in love with him, she agreed to take his place but fell completely under his control and largely became a puppet of his, so much so that she believed she really was Poseidal. To keep up the facade she wears a bizarre costume, including makeup and contact lenses.\nAs the years passed, Poseidal`s bio-relation weakened and Mian was able to think more for herself, particularly after the involvement of Full Flat. When Poseidal returns to Gastogal to return to his true role, she is able to deactive the bio-relation system that retains their eternal youth and she immediately ages to death.\n",
