Righty had attached itself onto Bonnie after the break-in at the hotel as it was trying to find Locke and Lefty. After reuniting in the hotel hallway, Ed allowed Righty to stay with Bonnie for a day while they went looking for Locke and Lefty.\nOnce they found them, Righty returned to Ed to bring him to the Pok√©mon Center which was on fire and Locke and Lefty were trapped inside. It helped put out the fire by using Water Gun. It was reunited with Lefty some point after Lefty was taken with Locke to the police station for question.",
