  "description" : "Haqua is a fellow demon and friend of Elsie. She graduated as an outstanding honour student and was promoted to the position of District Chief of District 32 in Nagumo city. However, until meeting Keima, she had never captured an escaped spirit. After hearing of Elsie`s successes in this regard, the gap within Haqua`s heart widened. This allowed a powerful spirit to take control of her. After Elsie calmed Haqua down, they joined forces and defeated the spirit. Even though her human partner is http://anidb.net/ch26096 [Marui Yukie], Keima has occasionally assisted Haqua in her quest to find and capture escaped spirits. She seems to have taken a liking to him.\nHaqua`s first name is derived from \"Cretaceous (白亜, Hakua)\".",
