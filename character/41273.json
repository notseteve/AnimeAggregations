  "description" : "The last of the four dukes. Rufus is known as the longest living duke and is a very knowledgeable person. He holds information on almost all topics and even knows people`s personalities and is thus able to predict their reactions. He absolutely detests people changing without him knowing as then he would not have the most updated information. Oz and co. approach Rufus to seek information about the Tragedy of Sablier. Rufus first appears as a round man with a big mustache wearing a big teacup shaped hat. Later, after getting destroyed by Break, it is revealed that the real Rufus created that as an illusion. The real Rufus has long red hair, tired looking eyes and speaks in olden-day Japanese. He was sought by Oz in order to learn more about the Tragedy of Sablier, but instead, they learned about Break`s past from him. Sheryl Rainsworth, Sharon`s grandmother, is a childhood friend of Rufus and he seems to fear the wrath of the Rainsworth family`s women, although in one of the omakes, he is seen entrusting a young Reim with a love letter to Sheryl, his first love. He discovers Arthur Barma`s book and decodes it to find out that Jack divided up his body.\nSource: Wikipedia",
