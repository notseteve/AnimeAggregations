  "description" : "Nanachi is a young child turned into a Hollow in http://anidb.net/ch91600 [Bondrewd]`s experiments. Dropped to and retrieved from the sixth layer along a young girl and close friend called http://anidb.net/ch91602 [Mitty], http://anidb.net/ch91601 [Nanachi] became partially inhuman, with their features becoming somewhat rabbit-like. Since escaping from Bondrewd`s facility, they have devoted their life to caring for http://anidb.net/ch91497 [Mitty], who lost all of her humanity and became a grotesque, immortal assortment of flesh and misshapen limbs. Even before being transformed into a Hollow, Nanachi always used gender-neutral pronouns and Nanachi`s gender was never stated.\nSource: Wikipedia",
