JD also said that he (Jet) is just like him (himself).\nIt seems that JD belonged to the Foundation, but somehow managed to escape and is now wanted. Hence, he avoided meeting the Foundation as much as he could, for fear of being taken away by them by force.\nHe always wants to see Angelique smile. He enjoys baking for others, often cookies or scones.\nHe fights with a pair of tonfa against Thanatos but possesses melee skills as well.\nSource: Wiki",
