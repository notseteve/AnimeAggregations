  "description" : "Aida Kazuo is Takemoto`s stepfather. He is an affable and loud man, but Takemoto has difficulty getting used to him because of how different Kazuo is from his father. Kazuo often means well, but is not terribly articulate and usually tries to use his actions to express what he means. He and his family accept both Takemoto and his mother as part of their family, though Takemoto still feels as though he does not belong.\nSource: Wikipedia",
