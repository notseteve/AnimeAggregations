  "description" : "Chigusa is Yuuji`s mother. She can seem gentle but she is strong and very intelligent. Her husband, Kantarou, works outside the country. Chigusa remains ignorant of Shana and Yuuji`s true nature, but becomes a source of good advice for Shana on matters where Alastor can not counsel her. The Crimson Lord himself acknowledges and bows to her wisdom after a phone call between the two of them. Described as a woman who can accept anything, she seems to harbor absolutely no problems with Shana often visiting Yuuji under the pretext of \"training\".",
