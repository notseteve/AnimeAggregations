  "description" : "Akane is an introverted and misunderstood girl. She is mature for her age but is very afraid of dogs, even Nana. This is because in her past life she was a fox who died after dogs attacked her and her family, and she was shot by a hunter who was hunting her. Now she is afraid of loud noises and bright lights. Her name means scarlet. Her color image is purple.\nHer pony tail and hair ribbon ties represent a fox`s tail and ears. She appears to be cold but is actually very friendly and warms to Midori more than the other angels. She reveals that she is in love with Gorou. Akane is in the Intermediate rank.",
