  "description" : "Vanilla is a shy and timid girl. Best friends with Chocolat, she is the daughter of Queen Candy. Blanca is her familiar. Vanilla has short, curly blond hair, large purple and timid-looking eyes, and pointed ears like Chocolat. She is more popular than Chocolat in the Human World, which leads Chocolat to believe that the Human World and the Magic World are flipped. Vanilla also tries harder than Chocolat to become Queen in the first two volumes of the manga. However, in the third volume Chocolat is able to beat her in a couple of other things. Almost halfway through the series, Vanilla turns into the princess of the ogres, along with the prince, Pierre due to Pierre`s own trickery on Vanilla`s insecurities. However, Chocolat was able to save her and Vanilla was able to return to her normal self. In the last volume of the manga she wins the competition, but refuses to take the crown. A few years later, she finally accepts the crown because Chocolat had been missing. But, in the anime, it is a lot more different. Vanilla wins the competition but gives the crown up to Chocolat, thinking that she is more suited to become queen.\nVanilla`s name translates from French as \"Better Vanilla\".\nSpell: Sugar Sugar Rune!
