  "description" : "A very arrogant and annoying Gourmet Hunter who wields a large axe to hunt. He is very self-centered and boasts about his completed full course menu which is made of dishes that probably don`t have a capture level of more than three, the only really dangerous dish being Garara Gator he had just killed (it was also a newborn making it no where near as strong or as tasty as the one Toriko fought). Despite all his boasting he is a very big coward using other as shields and making excuses when confront by a beast he can`t take down.",
