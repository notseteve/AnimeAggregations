  "description" : "A retired soldier who joined the http://anidb.net/ch39254 [Pumpkin Scissors] to aid in their war relief effort. He was part of the secret 901 anti-tank-trooper unit, which basically consisted of foot soldiers trained to take down enemy tanks by themselves.\nDespite his impressive stature, and a body riddled with scars, Randel`s nature most of the time is kind-hearted and ingenuous. But when he is in trouble he turns on his blue-steel lantern marked \"901-ATT\", and he becomes a fearless and vicious combatant.\nDue to his reckless style of combat brought on from his conditioning/training to ignore pain and fear, Randel is frequently hospitalized during the series.\nSource: Wiki",
