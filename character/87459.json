  "description" : "Eve was an upper-class Nasod who once was called The Little Queen of Nasods, back when humans and Nasods coexisted in Ancient Elrios. However, the reign of prosperity was fleeting as the power of El began to weaken. Nasod civilization declined without its power source. They sought help from the humans but were denied and thus the war between them began.\nYears passed with the humans winning the ancient war but at the same time diminished the El`s power. Only a few ancient Nasods survived the war and made it back into their preservation capsules. For thousands of years, Eve was preserved in her capsule unit to avoid the catastrophe until an El fragment accidentally flew into it. Eve woke up only to find out that she was stranded alone in this new present time. She gathered her remaining energy and ancient knowledge and joined the El Search Party to revive King Nasod and the Nasod race as the last Nasod in the world.\nSource: Wikipedia",
