  "description" : "A tomboy, childhood friend, and next door neighbor of Kio. Since she was young she wanted to join the CIA, where her room is filled with listening equipment and guns. She was in the CIA recruitment program operating under the supervisor codenamed JACK, but believes she is no longer a candidate after helping rescue Eris. She also lives at the Catian Embassy under its diplomatic immunity. She has feelings for Kio, but believes he sees her as just one of the guys and that she \"let her chance slip by\", so she roots for Aoi to get him before \"that alien steals him away\". She wears a watch with a noticeable scratch on it, which it got the day she realized she was in love with Kio; she will often rub the scratch when nervous. She has a noticeable fascination with guns, to the point where Kio refers to her as a gun otaku. She is often very pushy when it comes to helping Aoi make progress with her relationship with Kio, because she does not wish to see Aoi`s chance to slip by as she believes hers has. She finally kisses him in the last episode, after Eris reveals due to Catian law they could all be Kio`s lovers.\nSource: Wikipedia",
