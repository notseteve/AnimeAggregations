  "description" : "Nozomu is a first year female student at Kouta`s school who first appears in the third volume of the novels. She has short silver hair, and is in fact a 200-year-old wolf spirit. She has an older brother named Saku. Despite her seemingly detached and emotionless manner, she is in love with Kouta and thus a rival of Chizuru`s for Kouta`s affections. She sometimes insults Chizuru by calling her a \"Horny Beast,\" saying that Chizuru \"smells obscene\" and that her breasts are flabby. While she has small breasts and a much more childlike appearance than Chizuru, Nozomu also frequently tries to initiate sexual acts with Kouta. She lives by herself in an expensive penthouse apartment, though it is empty where she always sleeps naked on the floor. Though he truly cares for Chizuru, sometimes Kouta prefers Nozomu`s company because she is not as perverted as Chizuru. She is a serious glutton, especially for meat.",
