  "description" : "The AMA-01X Jamru-Fin is a transformable mobile armor being developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War that is never completed. Instead, the three unfinished prototypes are fitted with makeshift arms and heads and put into service, piloted by the \"3-D\" team of Dell, Dune and Danny. The Jamru-Fin is a very fast and powerful mobile armor, its primary armament being a high-powered hyper mega cannon capable of knocking out enemy warships outside of their sensor ranges. The Jamru-Fin can transform into a squat, mobile suit-like form armed with hand mounted beam guns/beam sabers for close combat. Its mobile armor form can also be fitted with a \"mega booster\" which mounts additional weapons, increased the Jamru-Fin`s speed and range, and also increasing the output power of its hyper mega cannon. The Jamru-Fin is also designed to be fitted with another, much larger, super-long-range booster powered by a nuclear pulse engine capable of operating in the intense gravity well of Jupiter.\nSource: mahq.net",
