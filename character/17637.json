  "description" : "Jose Porla was the guild master of the former Phantom Lord Guild. He wore a witch`s hat on his first outfit and a belt buckle on his second outfit that bears the Phantom Lord guild symbol. His first outfit also seems to have a pair of wings; whether they are real or just a cosmetic effect is not yet known. He dislikes the Fairy Tail Guild because before it came along, Phantom Lord was the strongest guild in the country, but now they`re considered equal. Thus he feels that they are upstarts who stole his guild`s title as the strongest. His magic is described as evil. He was also one of the Ten Wizard Saints before the war.",
