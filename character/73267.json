  "description" : "Cassandra is a mere human and the love interest of Apollon. He gave her a box and told her, that when she opens it, she can see/predict the future, just like him, in order to become closer.\nUpon opening the box, she saw such a horrible future that she coudln`t bear at all. She drowned herself in the river. She comes back as a ghost to haunt Apollon.\nA common version of her story is that Apollo gave her the power of prophecy in order to seduce her, but when she refused him, he gave her the curse of never being believed. In an alternative version, she fell asleep in a temple, and snakes licked (or whispered in) her ears so that she was able to hear the future. Snakes as a source of knowledge is a recurring theme in Greek mythology, although sometimes the snake brings understanding of the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future. Cassandra is a figure of both epic tradition and of tragedy.",
