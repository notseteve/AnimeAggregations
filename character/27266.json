  "description" : "Cofagrigus, known as the Coffin Pok√©mon, is a blue and yellow sarcophagus with four hands that appear to be shadows. It is said if it is approached by humans, it will eat them and turn them into mummies. It pretends to be an elegant coffin to punish grave robbers. With a body of pure gold, it likes eating gold nuggets.\nCofagrigus and its pre-evolution, Yamask, were called two of the GamesRadar staff`s favorite designs, citing the Egyptian origins and that they have two faces. Game Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized its design process, stating \"Alright, now this is just stupid.\" In the English version it has to be renamed to be traded, as its name contains the word `fag`.",
