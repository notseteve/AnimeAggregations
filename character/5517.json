  "description" : "Ymir is the daughter of the Dwarven King who runs the Iron Mountain weapon factory, which is known for forging top-quality weapons. Ymir entered the Queen`s Blade tournament to prove the superiority of Dwarven weapons. In the anime, she has a strong one-sided rivalrly with Cattleya as a weaponsmith. Despite her childlike appearance, Ymir is actually older than she looks, evidenced by her speech pattern which is reminiscient to that of an old man. She wields a massive battle axe and wears a special guantlet that increases her strength, and spends most of her time hawking cheap weapons at inflated rates to the unsuspecting. Despite her strength, she has an intense fear of snakes, specifically from Echidna`s snake Keltan.\nYmir`s name is taken from Norse mythological being Ymir.\nSource: Wiki",
