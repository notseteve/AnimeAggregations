  "description" : "Suguru Misato is a junior high school student living in Tokyo. He lost both his parents earlier â€” his mother, and years later, his father. While he believed his father was killed in an accident during a business trip, he was actually a commander (and Mahoro`s commanding officer) in VESPER and was killed-in-action during the alien war. Although relatives offered to take him in, he refused and lived alone prior to Mahoro`s arrival.\nHe is smart and has an IQ of 130. He makes a favorable impression on members of the opposite sex.\nSuguru hired a maid because of the filthy state of his house. He was expecting an older woman, and Mahoro`s arrival completely surprised him.",
