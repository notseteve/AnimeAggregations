  "description" : "A grandma`s girl who covers herself in both tradition and revolution, and sees big dreams in the rakugo world.\nShe loves arts and culture of all kindsâ€”new and old, Eastern and Western.\nShe visits museums so often that she is left penny-pinching the rest of the time. It is most certainly not due to her frequent purchases of alcohol.\nThrough her encounter with rakugo, she has come to enjoy public speaking more than ever, and she is fervishly writing up her own skits.",
