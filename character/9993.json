  "description" : "This snappy veggie can often be found up on the hill, day and night. He offers what may be sage words of wisdom, commentary and a manic laugh - but it`s hard to tell if he`s wise or insane... possibly both! He tends to pop up when least expected. You will see Croconion frequently throughout the anime, particularly at the closing of a scene or episode where his short proverb-style sayings add an amusing finishing touch - followed by the aforementioned manic laughter.\nSource: http://www.tatodog.com/characters/",
