  "description" : "Grant`s Tyrunt was the second Pokémon that Ash Ketchum faced in his Gym Battle against Grant. Ash Ketchum noted after consulting his dex that he and his Pokémon would have to be careful of that huge mouth and those fangs that Grant`s Tyrunt has. Bonnie also commented that Grant`s Tyrunt looked like a formidable opponent right from the start.\nAsh`s Froakie was the first to face Grant`s Tyrunt having defeated Grant`s Onix. Ash Ketchum underestimated Tyrunt and Draco Meteor ended up knocking out Ash`s Froakie. Ash`s Fletchling was the next Pokémon sent out to fact it but it was also quickly overpowered and knocked out of the air with Dragon Tail.\nThe final matchup was Grant`s Tyrunt vs Pikachu and Grant thought Ash Ketchum was bold for using an Electric type against Tyrunt as it is both a Rock and a Dragon type and had an overwhelming advantage. Pikachu used a move Ash Ketchum called Draco Meteor Tomb where it was able to deflect the attack with Iron Tail. After using Rock Tomb, Pikachu was able to deflect one of the rocks into Tyrunt`s mouth and finish it off with Thunderbolt.",
