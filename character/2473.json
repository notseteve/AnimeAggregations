  "description" : "Despite her childish and very short (135 cm) appearance, she is actually an adult and one of Touma`s teachers. This is proven by her apartment being littered with beer cans and cigarettes. She also contradicts her age by acting childish to her students, having a child-like crush on Touma, and ending her sentences with desu, something a child usually does. This irony means that she is often regarded as one of the seven great mysteries of Academy City.",
