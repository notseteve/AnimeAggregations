  "description" : "Lina Inverse is the primary protagonist and the only character appearing in the whole Slayers-franchise. She is an adolescent but very powerful sorceress, with a great love for money, treasure and food. In the anime and manga (but not in the light novel) Lina uses overly destructive magic recklessly, often with little provocation. She is reputed to be an evil, powerful, destructive, diminutive sorceress (the evil part is arguably not true, though one may consider her greed and general lack of concern for others unless they are in danger of being killed can be considered \"evil\").\nLina has gained many different nicknames, including \"Bandit Killer\" and \"Dragon Spooker\", neither of which she`s very fond of, though to her, her most embarrassing nickname is \"Lina the Pink\" which is her official title amongst the sorcerer`s guild.",
