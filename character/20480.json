  "description" : "The reverend of Daten City and the mentor of the Anarchy sisters, Garterbelt (or \"Garter\", for short) is a large black man with a massive afro. He gives Panty and Stocking their missions, and is constantly annoyed and bewildered by their erratic behavior and lack of commitment to the task at hand. He is shown to be homosexual with a particular interest in young males, much to the chagrin of Brief, who is a constant target for his sexual advances, and also practices in bondage. Although he is rather vocal about keeping order in Daten City, he has a masked alias known as Master G which he uses to disguise his identity whilst pursuing more risky hobbies. Despite being clear to the audience, everyone in the show seems to be oblivious to Master G`s true identity.\nGarterbelt also has a very checkered past; he used to be a gangster who performed all crimes imaginable. He eventually became the greatest crime lord in his town, but was gunned down in his own office. Soon after, he had ended up in Heaven, where he was given an as-of-yet undisclosed mission by God. When he refused, he was cursed with immortality and sent to the beginning of time, forced to live through the creation of the world as it is today.",
