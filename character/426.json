  "description" : "Tangela`s name is a corrupted form of the word \"tangle\", which is both what it appears visually and what its vines often do to opponents. Its Japanese name comes from mojamoja (もじゃもじゃ, mojamoja?), which refers to shagginess. It is unknown what this Pokémon looks like underneath its vines, only its eyes and two feet are visible. If a vine is lost or damaged it will grow back the next day. The vines always jiggle, which easily unnerves its foes.",
