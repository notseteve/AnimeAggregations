  "description" : "Rosetta Passel is one of Sora`s many friends in the Kaleido Star anime. While she was raised in France, her original birth took place in Belgium. She has been a diabolo prodigy since she was nine years old, when she won her first diabolo tournament, and once went by the nickname of \"The Diabolo Machine\" due to her flawless performances and cold personality. Like Layla, Sora helps change Rosetta`s outlook on everything when they become friends. When Rosetta joins the main cast in the second season, she sees Sora as a role model figure and wants to be just like her while a strong sister like bond grows between them.",
