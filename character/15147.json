  "description" : "Ayuzawa Misaki is the heroine of Kaichou wa Maid-sama!. She lives alone with her mother and sister because her father abandoned them, leaving them with a huge debt. Because of her father`s actions, she has a deep hatred for most boys (except the gentlemanly type).\nShe goes to Seika high school, which only recently became co-ed. It was an all-boy`s school only a few years ago. Because of this, the student body is 80% male and 20% female. Misaki worked hard to become the student council president and \"protect the girls\". However, she has a secret. To help her mother pay off her father`s debt, she has a part-time job... at a maid cafe! She doesn`t want anyone at school to discover her, because she thinks that if they do, she will lose her authority as student council president.\nShe is sixteen years old, and practises aikido (a form of martial arts/self-defence).",
