  "description" : "Hachiken Yuugo is a city boy from Sapporo. After failing to pass the entrance exams for the high school of his preference, Yuugo decided to enroll at Yezo instead, believing that easier academic course would leave him with more time to prepare for college exams. However, the agricultural courses` demand for hard labor proved his assumptions wrong. Due to his father`s strict upbringing, he is somehow unable to refuse when someone needs his help. Despite complaining a lot when he feels people are abusing of his generosity, Yuugo quickly earns the friendship and respect of his peers. Just after enrolling, he joins the Equestrian Club along his classmate Aki, soon rising to the position of vice-president due to his reliable nature. Yuugo is usually anxious about his future as, unlike his classmates who already have set their goals in life, he is still wondering about what career he should choose.\nSource: Wikipedia",
