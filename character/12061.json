  "description" : "Hazuki Mina is a colleague of Genma`s, Mina is a Contractor with the ability to charge any object with energy, which she uses to create potent projectiles from scraps and turn her sword into a \"lightsaber\". She also uses retractable wires similar to Hei`s. Her remuneration is to passionately kiss a man, which she appears to dislike due to \"bad aftertaste\"; such is her distaste that with even two mouth washings, she resorts to kissing another woman to remove the taste, though she hints to having a lesbian interest in women. She seems to specialise in wetwork, wearing a half-faced balaclava and wielding a wooden katana (which she transforms using her ability). After killing Genma in revenge for Youko`s death, Mina disappears.",
