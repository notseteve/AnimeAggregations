  "description" : "Just as in the original http://anidb.net/a77 [Super Dimension Fortress Macross], Milia is depicted as an ace pilot. Milia is first seen when the Meltrandi breached http://anidb.net/ch49046 [Vrlitwhai]`s http://anidb.net/ch49050 [Nupetiet-Vergnitzs]. As she entered the ship, Milia starts killing every Zentran she sees, and after executing her task, flees with gusto.Milia`s subsequent appearance in the movie is during the battle between the Macross fleet and the Meltrandi. In this battle, Milia entered into Lap Lamiz`s ship with a tailing http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius] behind her. She was shot down within the ship. Upon breaching the http://anidb.net/ch49048 [Queadluun-Rau] armor, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] is enamored by Milia (as she is with him) and expresses his awe of the Meltran pilot. Milia and http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] are finally seen battling together against http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer] and his fleet, http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] having been enlarged to Zentradi size.Source: wiki",
