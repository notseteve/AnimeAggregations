  "description" : "Unit 00 is the Prototype, the first successful Evangelion, and is piloted by the First Child, Ayanami Rei. The head design is similar to that of the previous failed attempts, but with only one eye. There are two domes on the top of the head, one white and one transparent green; their function (if any) is never revealed. Unit 00 is the only one of the original Evas that is never seen without its armour (Unit 02 was revealed in End of Evangelion, and Unit 01 on multiple occasions) or opening its mouth; thus the appearance of its organic body is unknown.\nUnit 00 was initially coloured orange like the previous prototypes, but its armour was damaged beyond repair by the Angel Ramiel`s particle beam. The subsequent repairs and upgrades included blue armour plating in addition to other alterations made in order to make it more suitable for combat conditions. The upgrades to Unit 00`s armour make it look more like the subsequent Evas, but there are still several differences or actual limitations. Shoulder \"blades\" are added to the Unit`s armour; though similar in appearance to the ones on Units 01 and 02, they are used to hold retro-rockets, as seen in the fight with the ninth Angel, Matariel. Because it is only the prototype, Unit 00 cannot be fitted with D-type equipment. The true nature of the soul inside Unit 00 is never specified, but it is implied to be directly connected to Rei in some fashion.\nUnit 00 was self-destructed by Rei in order to destroy the sixteenth Angel, Armisael.",
