  "description" : "The owner of the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons team. He is more interested in gaining money than getting the Lycaons to win. He forms the One Outs contract with Toua Tokuchi but later on as he realises he is still losing money to Toua he adds more conditions to the contract. He has a few members of the team under his control as pawns that will do his bidding, few of them are the secretary, sales, scouts, scorekeepers and even the manager of the team. He blackmails the Lycaons shortstop, Yoshida, to sabotage the game for Toua, but after Yoshida sees the Lycaons players manage to stop the Eagles by 8 players he decides to neglect what the owner and contributes in scoring the 12th run from the winning against the Eagles which causes the owner to get angry.",
