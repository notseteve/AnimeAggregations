  "description" : "Takamiya Rina is a transfer student to St. Paulia`s Private School. Rina becomes interested in Asuka Jr. and his mission to catch Saint Tail. Because she is related to the mayor, Rina is able to take over Asuka Jr.`s investigations. Because of Rina`s strong sense of justice, she wants to become a police woman. Catching Saint Tail would assist in her ambitions. Rina is taller than Asuka Jr., making the young detective uncomfortable standing beside her. She also has a boyish and bullyish nature.\nBecause of Meimi`s athletic abilities and other circumstances, Rina suspects her to be Saint Tail. She makes a bet with Asuka Jr. that if Meimi is Saint Tail, then Asuka Jr. has to be Rina`s boyfriend. The two are disillusioned when Rina catches Saint Tail, but the magical thief uses her magic to switch a guard in her place. The knocked-out guard, dressed as Saint Tail, fools Asuka Jr. and Rina into thinking that Saint Tail is really an older man, and Rina stops stalking Meimi over the issue.",
