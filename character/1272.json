It represents spatial dimensions whereas Dialga represents time.It has the ability to distort space. It is described as a deity in Sinnoh-region mythology.}}Palkia, like Dialga, has an appearance of a dinosaur. Palkia has what looks like wings on its back, which can open up. Palkia also has two pink pearls on each shoulder. In Sinnoh-region lore, it was said to be created by Arceus, at which time space began to take form and matter began to take shape. Its signature move is \"Spacial Rend\".\nPalkia is only obtainable in Pearl, in the same way that Dialga is only obtainable in Diamond. It is summoned by the defeated leader of Team Galactic, Team Galactic Cyrus, who hopes to have it create a new universe for him, at the Spear Pillar on top of Mt. Coronet. It is stopped by Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, which nullifiy its power, and can be captured or defeated by the player.\nPalkia has a roar that sounds extremely similar to the varactyl, a large reptilian creature from Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. In the movie Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai, it has another roar which is the exact copy of King Ghidorah from the Godzilla franchise.",
