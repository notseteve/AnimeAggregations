  "description" : "Lorenza is a Poet and Cagliostro`s alluring partner, although he seems far more interested in liquor than in her. Despite her demure appearance, she is not above being ruthless in using the power of the Psalms to bind or kill anyone who stands in her way. Her character is loosely based on Lorenza Seraphina Feliciani, the historical Cagliostro`s wife.",
