  "description" : "A huge mobile armor that has been developed over a span of six years by the Zeon remnants on Earth, based on a weapons plan designed by Haman Karn`s forces during the first Neo Zeon War. Thanks to the assistance and technological support of the Sleeves, it employs a psycho-frame, the latest in psycommu technology. Its large-caliber mega particle cannon gives it overwhelming offensive strength, and it can use its reflector bits to form an impenetrable defense. This giant machine has a hybrid underwater/surface propulsion system, which combines Minovsky craft and hovering systems, and despite its appearance it has excellent stealth and mobility both on land and in the water. Its pilot is Loni Garvey.",
