  "description" : "Though she is not initially involved in the street-fighting tournament Maki joins, Sampaguita Kai was one of her most difficult opponents. Using a similar fighting style to Maki, Kai faces her in a tag-team match during a women`s wrestling tournament. She becomes obsessed, like a number of Maki`s earlier opponents, with beating Maki. She`s the younger sister of Lucha Master, who taught her how to fight ever since she was young. Kai gained the ninth rank within the Fukamichi Rankings after beating Shun Yashiki, however she is narrowly defeated by Kinjiro Kitaeda, which leaves her ranked ten. Kai`s signature move is the \"Izukaya Bomber\", which involves a clothesline takedown; she learns this move from her former mentor/wrestling partner Hayase Mio.",
