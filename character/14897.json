  "description" : "Guyver One is Sho Fukamachi , an ordinary high school student, who was merged with a bio-booster symbiont completely by accident. Chronos has attempted anything in their power to get the bio-weapon back... and thus turned Guyver One into one of their most deadly enemies.\nAlthough Guyver One is probably the least powerful Guyver due to the nature of its host as it can be assumed that all Guyver Units have the same power levels so differences between them come predominantly from their Hosts, he is nevertheless a formidable opponent. He is also the warrior who succesfully merged with a Creator-ship, and as a result created the Gigantic upgrade. This alone makes him unique.",
