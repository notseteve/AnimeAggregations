  "description" : "Gallade, known as the Blade Pokémon, is a human-like Pokémon that seems to be the masculine counterpart to Gardevoir. This Pokémon can only be a male, evolving from a male Kirlia when exposed to a Dawn Stone. The crest on its head is reminiscent of the helmet of a hoplite. Sharp, green, spear-like blades extend from Gallade`s elbows, which Gallade uses skillfully and powerfully in battle. These blades can be retracted into Gallade`s elbows when not in combat, possibly so that it does not somehow manage to hurt those it is close to. As its evolutionary line and Gardevoir resemble elegant female dancers, Gallade may be a dancer as well. If true, Gallade may be based partly on a traditional Brazilian dance called Maculelê, which involves dancing through expressive and athletic motions and a form of sword play. Gallade are valiant and noble fighters, adept at both melee combat and swordplay. They are noble in the sense that they follow strict codes of manners and conduct in and outside of battles. This sense of honor can be compared to that of a samurai`s or knight`s. Their behavior is quite similar, in that a Gallade, as well as a Gardevoir, will protect its trainer, even if doing so could end its life. Their names are based on the word \"gallant\" and \"blade\", which represents them in many ways.",
