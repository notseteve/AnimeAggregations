  "description" : "Wormadam is the evolved form of female Burmy. Wormadam is a unique Pok√©mon due to its multiple forms, which have different colors and different stats, as well as different secondary types. Wormadam`s form is dependent upon the form of the Burmy from which it evolved, as the materials on it become part of Wormadam`s body. If a Burmy evolves while battling inside a forest or in a grassy area it will evolve into the grass type Wormadam. If a Burmy evolves while battling inside a cave or on a mountainous region it will evolve into the ground type Wormadam. If a Burmy evolves while battling inside a building it will evolve into the steel type Wormadam.",
