  "description" : "Vanilluxe, known as the Snowstorm Pokémon, is the final form of Vanillite. It represents a cone of ice cream with two scoops. One of the scoops has a straw-like figure which has mist flowing out of it. They can create snow clouds inside their body by swallowing large amounts of water. They use this to attack their foes with violent blizzards. If both heads are angry at the same time, the blizzard created by this Pokémon buries everything in snow.\nOfficial Nintendo Magazine`s Chris Schilling used Vanilluxe as an example of a unique Pokémon in this generation compared to the safer ones earlier in the game.",
