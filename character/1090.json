  "description" : "Regice is a legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald that can only be caught in the Island Cave once in each game. It can also be found inside a cave in Pokemon Ranger. It will be obtainable in Pokémon Platinum at the Mt. Coronet exit at Route 216 only if the special Regigigas from the eleventh movie is transferred to the Platinum game. Regice`s body of Antarctic ice was made during an ice age. It cannot be melted, even if hit by fire or placed in magma. It also controls air of -328 degrees Fahrenheit (-164.4 degrees Celsius.)\nIt also appears to represent the Ice Age just like fellow Regis, Regirock who represents the Stone Age, Registeel who represents the Iron Age and Regigigas who represents the time of Pangaea.",
