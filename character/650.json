  "description" : "Guts is the primary protagonist of the story. He is a tall, muscular man who wields the Dragon Slayer, a zweih√§nder or 2 handed sword about 7` long and 12\" wide at its base. Described in the manga as more of a table-sized slab of iron than a blade, the Dragon Slayer`s massive size makes it the ideal weapon for slaying apostles of the God Hand. Guts` left hand is prosthetic, a replacement for the one he lost when Griffith attempted to sacrifice him to the forces of hell; it folds back to expose a hidden cannon within the wrist. Guts also carries throwing knives, miniature bombs, a dagger, and even a repeating crossbow that can be mounted onto his prosthetic arm.",
