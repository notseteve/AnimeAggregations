  "description" : "Vincent is Gilbert`s younger brother by one year. As the Vessalius family found Gilbert, the Nightray family similarly adopted Vincent. His left eye is golden like Gilbert`s, but his right eye is wine-red and his long hair is golden in color. He loves his brother Gilbert to the point of slight obsession. He has an easy-going personality on the outside and is often seen smiling. However, it is shown that Vincent also has a dark, unstable side. He has a habit of carrying around scissors and cutting up stuffed animals with them. Break is often at odds with him, referring to Vincent as a dirty `rat`, which is fueled by Vincent sending Echo to attack Sharon.\nSource: Wikipedia",
