  "description" : "Makina is a Pokémon Trainer that Ash and his friends met in a forest on route to the nearby the Lakeside Resort. She often tells people to call her by her nickname \"Rissa\" in the English dub. Her Ditto`s had wandered away from her and started causing trouble as they were transforming into Pikachu, Piplup and Gible which made those Pokémon angry and get into fights with the Ditto`s.\nShe is big fan of the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint and she dresses up just like him. She also had a small crush on Brock as he helped her with her battling techniques, but that quickly ended when she saw him go after another girl that was walking by in the forest.\nShe also battled against Ash and copied his Pokémon in the battle, but his experience and the strength of his Pokémon proved to be too much for her and he was able to win easily.",
