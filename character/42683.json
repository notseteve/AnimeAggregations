  "description" : "He is one of the six members of Aion`s team and the second to be killed along with his enemy Carv. A massive hulk, Vido is normally paired off with Genai on missions and as defense. His quiet and thoughtful manner is in stark contrast to Genai`s outburst`s and irrational behavior. Although he was injured fighting Pandemonium, he was only affected by the force field she threw up rather than the claws she slashed with and was able to make a full recovery. In the manga he dies defending Eden against the order and Pandemoniums` pursuers.\nSource: Wiki",
