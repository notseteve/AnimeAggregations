  "description" : "Bikara is a member of the Juunishinshou. He specializes in power and speed. Four years before the start of Samurai Deeper Kyo, Bikara fought Kyou in Sekigahara. The battle ended in a draw. In Aokigahara, Kyou fought Bikara again, nearly killing him. When he, Akira, Antera, and Shindara reached the ice fortress where Kyou`s true body was hidden, Akira killed Bikara and took Kyou`s body.\nBikara is a hand-to-hand specialist and surprises his enemies with his speed. He uses numerous metal disks as weapons. Despite his massive size and extremely macho appearance, Bikara is extremely effeminate and very girlish and seems to be jealous of actual women. He is also gay, since he proclaims himself to be in love with the sleeping Kyou and implies that he finds Sasuke attractive too.",
