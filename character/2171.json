  "description" : "The top ace in the S.M.S. private military company and leader of Skull Squadron, he holds the rank of Major and is an experienced former N.U.N.S. pilot. He is an avid fan of Fire Bomber and often plays their songs in his car or while at home, and also names Skull Squadron`s battle formations after their songs (i.e., \"Planet Dance\", \"Totsugeki Love Heart\"). Although laid-back and careless on the outside, he knows when to be serious, and believes that the real duty of a soldier is to care for his subordinates and civilians. He is somewhat overprotective of his sister Ranka Lee, and lies to her about his work so she will not worry about him, telling her he has a desk job in a company`s personnel department.",
