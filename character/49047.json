  "description" : "Exsedol appeared in the movie http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?], also as a Zentradi advisor who becomes a defector to the human side. However, his appearance was radically redesigned, with a bald, swollen head, green skin, a cloak covering his body, and retractable tendrils for arms.\nThis design was carried over to his subsequent appearance in the TV series http://anidb.net/a442 [Macross 7], with some slight differences, namely that he has a blue collar, green tendrils, and a slightly darker skin tone. Exsedol in http://anidb.net/a442 [Macross 7] is also rarely seen without a hemispherical cap on his cranium, usually connected to the ceiling.\nSource: wiki",
