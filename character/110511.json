He took a liking to humans and their traditions. He could at times be quite humorous calling Frankenstein a peacock, who returned him the favour by calling him a bugger. All in all, he seemed to have a quite easy going personality compared to his daughter, the current Lord. He displayed a fatherly nature towards her, nagging her for her unladylike behavior and warning her to be careful around guys since they can`t be trusted. He also cared for Rai and wished that he would become the next Lord instead of his daughter. He even gave Rai two silver crosses as a gift stating that it was a human tradition. One of them serves as Rai`s earring, the other one is located in Rai`s abandoned mansion in Lukedonia. His soul weapon is called Ragnarok. It takes the form of a beautiful decorated sword and it is supposed to be so powerful that humans associate it with the end of the world.\n(Source: Wikipedia, Noblesse Wikia)",
