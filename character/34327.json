  "description" : "Misawa Juku was a school which degenerated into a cult that centered its worship on science. It converted people by saying rare abilities could be copied and given to someone else. Aureolus Izzard eventually took over the school and destroyed the cult, as he needed Himegami to obtain a vampire. Aureolus converted the cram school into his fortress.",
