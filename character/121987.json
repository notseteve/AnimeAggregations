  "description" : "Her name is Shenhua Ling. She is a young girl who lives in a rural village in Guilin. Shenhua is a mysterious girl, who has a vast knowledge of plants and animals; she can find her tracks even in the wilderness and is also able to read the weather by wind. She’s pure and simple but at times puts herself at risk for the sake of others. She was named \"Shenhua\" since she was born when the Shenmue Tree bloomed. Shenhua currently lives with her foster parent Yunshen Yuan, after losing her parents at a young age.\nSource: Official site",
