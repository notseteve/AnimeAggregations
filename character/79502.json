  "description" : "Ippei`s Greninja is Ippei`s main Pokémon and strongest combatant of the ninja village. Kagetomo`s Weavile was summoned to battle against Ippei`s Greninja. Hanzo noted that in terms of speed and the power of their moves, they were evenly matched and perhaps Kagetomo`s Weavile might be a bit stronger but Ippei had his brothers and the ninja villageres for support, something that Kagetomo didn`t have. Ippei defeated Kagetomo in a Pokémon battle and as a result, Kagetomo realized he wasn`t strong enough yet but he also had a change of heart.",
