He has a bald head, a muscular body but neither hands nor feet; he can fly through the air, carrying things and people, has supernatural strength (though losing in hand-to-hand combat to http://anidb.net/ch8585 [Rin]) and a surprising skill in flower arrangement but a somewhat narcissistic personality (hence his name that means \"shining macho\").",
