  "description" : "A very rich boy who is popular among girls, but he seemed to hate it. Kaoru`s playful attitude makes him friends with Kaede (the girl of his dreams) and Murumo. He would do anything (with his gigantic fortune, of course} to be Kaede`s boyfriend, but her crush on Yuki blocks that, much to Kaoru`s chagrin. In the end of the series Kaede kiss Kaoru on the lips. He has his own butler/security guard/caretaker, and relies heavily on him. Although he may not show it, he is a cry baby and spoiled, once when he fell on his rear end, he had an entire set of medical machines and when everyone left, he started bawling, but he can hide it just as fast, like when Kaede enters the room. But he is still spoiled, as showed when he met Kaede and his heart beat increased, his butler then considered bringing in an entire team of doctors. In the season finale, Kaoru managed to propose to Kaede but Kaede turned him down, causing him to act and look like an old man (his way of showing his heartbroken self). Kaede and Mirmo also concluded that Kaoru might still be famous (especially to girls) even in his old days.",
