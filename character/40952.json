  "description" : "He is a scientist that works at the Foundation who bears deep hatred for Rayne, since he always got all the attention. He gets angry or annoyed when Rayne simply calls him \"Eren\", telling him that he has a name and it is \"Erenfried\", and responds by calling Rayne \"Professor\".\nJet takes orders from Erenfried and Director Yorgo, whose attention Erenfried always intends to get. Erenfried admires and is grateful to Director Yorgo because he offered him a place as a researcher in the Foundation and assigned funding to his project.\nIn season 2 when Yorgo is imprisoned (due to mistakes of Erenfried with the Jinx project), he wants to rescue him. He somewhat befriends Angelique and company in season 2, when JD rescues him from the organization`s prison, and stays with the group for a while.\nHe also realizes that \"Artifacts/Jasper Dolls\" have hearts when JD rescues him from jail.\nSource: Wiki",
