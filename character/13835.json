  "description" : "Cloaked and shrouded in mysteries, Fleur (or Eve as she introduces herself) is a merchant from the port town of Renos. Due to events in the past, this trader is wary of just about everyone. Although hard to approach, Eve is talkative under the right circumstances and has a keen eye for people and business alike. She is in fact a fallen noble that was once sold as slave to another merchant after her family`s fall. She organized a secret smuggling operation with the church then left it after she felt that they don`t need her cooperation anymore then made a contract with Lawrence.\nSource: Wiki",
