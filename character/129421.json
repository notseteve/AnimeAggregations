  "description" : "Raihan`s Flygon battled against Ash`s Dragonite in the match that featured Masters Eight on the line. Sandstorm proved to be very effective against Dragonite as it couldn`t see where the attacks were coming from for most of the match. It defeated Ash`s Dragonite and then battled against Ash`s Gengar. It initially used the same battle technique of obscuring its attacks and being able to navigate through the Sandstorm but after Gigantamax Gengar sucked up the Sandstorm, it was quickly defeated.",
