He claims to have joined the art club instead of the manga club because he could not stand the otaku behavior of its members, although Akiba is quite the otaku himself. He dedicated himself to drawing manga.\nHe often launches himself into very long and detailed diatribes, speaking so quickly that people end up just ignoring him.",
