  "description" : "The Audhumla is one of a handful of Garuda-class transport planes constructed by the Earth Federation Forces. These enormous aircraft are pressed into service during the hurried evacuation of the Federation`s Jaburo base, and the AEUG soldiers seize two of them during their own escape. One of these, the Audhumla, eventually becomes a mobile headquarters for the Karaba resistance group. Able to transport ten to twenty mobile suits and an equivalent number of support sleds - and, incidentally, capable of launching Temptation-class space shuttles into orbit! - the Audhumla makes an excellent airborne carrier. Others of its class, like the Sudori and Melord, are similarly employed by the pursuing Titans.",
