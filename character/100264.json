In the past he was a rising star of the Yakuza and son of the head of a Yakuza branch. Sometime after falling in love with another Yakuza male of a rival branch he would leave the Yakuza behind him in order to pursue happiness though his homosexual lifestyle.\nKobayashi also acts as a counselor and adviser to his more favorite customers such as Natsuo, and is always willing to help him and others, especially when it comes to love. He has a soft spot for cute males and makes no attempt to hide his desires to those he likes. Kobayashi also dresses brazenly in keeping for any event he attends, although he wears stockings while attending his cafe.\nSource: Wikipedia",
