  "description" : "A fourteen year old girl with long peach coloured hair, Kuu is the youngest of the Orla family and is often seen wearing a completely black dress. While she has a bishoujo appearance, she carries a wicked tongue, and appears to be more mature than Sui, often complaining that she has to look after him, and may never to be able to become a bride because of this. Like her brother Sui, she wields a Rule Fragme known as \"The Scythe of Ailuchrono\". The artefact is in the shape of a large scythe, and rapidly increases the wielder`s strength and speed, allowing Kuu to easily match up to Ferris`s speed. The blade also has the ability to freeze anyone who comes into contact with it, and Kuu manages to use this ability to stop Sui from bleeding to death. As a side effect, the artefact \"freezes\" the wielder`s heart as well and Kuu will lose all her emotional capacity when she`s wielding it.",
