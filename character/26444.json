  "description" : "Known as \"Batty\" in the English manga, Kou is Kokoa`s shapeshifting bat possesses the ability to transform itself into a variety of blunt weapons for Kokoa to use (in one instance, he transformed into a rapier). Weighing in at 100 kilograms, he was originally a birthday gift from Moka, but since Moka did not have superhuman strength when she was 10 years old, Kou-chan ended up with Kokoa. In the anime, he acts as the narrator and occasionally covers up various shots of fanservice (done in the television broadcast, while the DVD version is uncensored), and also appears to state the exact duration of a fight. In the manga, various bats of similar design are used to give information on the various youkai encountered at the academy. He does not have any lines of speech in the manga, but in the anime, he frequently ends his sentences with dechuu (でちゅー, translated as \"Squee\" in Funimation`s subs).\nIn Rosario + Vampire Capu2, Kou takes a more active part in the story as Kokoa`s pet (much to the characters` surprise, since all believed he was simply a narrator), and in one episode, assumed the guise of a student named Ijuuin Koutarou. His powers as Koutarou allow him to use hypnosis through the uttering of a specific word (Je t`aime, the French phrase for \"I love you\"), specifically to that of an incubus. He intended to use his abilities to enslave the entire female student body (including Gin and Nekonome), even to the extent of enslaving Kokoa and Moka, who atttempted to resist his powers. He was swiftly defeated by the two vampires and reverted to his bat form, returning the female student body to normal after one of his teeth fell out.",
