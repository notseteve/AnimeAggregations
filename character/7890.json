  "description" : "Valgarv is a half-mazoku, half-ancient dragon, a trusted servant of Chaos Dragon Garv.\nValgarv is approximately 1000 years old, as he was apparently alive during or after the Kouma War, although only as a young boy.\nBefore becoming a servant of Garv, he was an ancient dragon known as Val. With no future as a dragon, Garv turned him into a mazoku and thus, he became Valgarv. Possibly due to the mazoku barrier, he was unable to assist Garv with his objectives and could not prevent his death at the hands of Hellmaster Fibrizo, who was destroyed by the Lord of Nightmares, thus his chance for vengence against the Hellmaster was unknowingly ruined. However, when news of his master`s death reached him, Valgarv incorrectly believed that Lina Inverse was the one responsible for Garv`s death, and he wanted her to die at his hands.",
