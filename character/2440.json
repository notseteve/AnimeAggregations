She is so carefree that she will kill the enemies of the Apostles without a second thought, often kissing them and burning them from the inside. She leaves the Apostles of the Stars with Charden, so he won`t be lonely. Kyouko starts to like Train when she first meets him, and falls in love with him when he saves her from a thief. Due to her feelings, she commits herself to Train`s own personal philosophy to not kill senselessly.",
