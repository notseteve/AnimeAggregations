The two had began a long distance realtionship with one another shortly after until Hitome had graduated from high school and the two were reunited. He appears to have loved her very much because he will begin to burst in tears when he tries to remember her and speak of her ever since her death, making it difficult for Kanata to learn about his mother.",
