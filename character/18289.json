  "description" : "Herba is one of the Four Lords of Gaudium with the appearance of a humanoid plant woman. She is considered Earl Tyrant`s favorite and usually sits besides him on his throne. She carries an umbrella and is usually accompanied by her pet Hug-Hug. She has a habit of adding the word, \"baby\" behind a person`s name if she likes them. She draws her power from plants. In the end of the anime, Herba falls into Chaos, but in FFU:After, it`s revealed that she actually survived to become Princess Herba. She assumes her role as Chaos` agent by using her plants to feed Chaos until the Hayakawa twins Yu and Ai assume their chosen role as Chaos Rulers.\nFurthermore, she was responsible for transforming Dolk, Lisa Pacifist`s lover and part of the C2 Organization which she works for, into Soljashy, the first Lord of Gaudium under her. Soljashy is part of Herba`s plot to feed Chaos. She retreated into Wonderland after manipulating Lisa to open the portal to that world.",
