  "description" : "Dii was an Onkamiya scholar that wandered inside the cave where Witsuarunemitea`s soul was sealed. Just as Hakuoro is the Iceman`s `good` side, Dii is now possessed by Witsuarunemitea`s darker side. He instigates and catalyzes wars far and wide so that Witsuarunemitea`s children (all races were based on Iceman, Witsuarunemitea`s avatar) could, via natural selection, reach greater heights. Dii, unlike Hakuoro, has complete conscious control of his abilities and is able to dispense with the powerful Genjimaru without visible effort. At the conclusion of his final battle with Hakuoro, Dii`s mortal form is destroyed, and the dark half of Witsuarunemitea`s soul that dwelled within him is reunited with Hakuoro.",
