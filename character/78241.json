  "description" : "Miton is the magical creature that turns http://anidb.net/ch78244 [Yuzuka] into a magical girl after meeting her. His appearance (to Yuzuka and other girls with the aptitude of magical girls) features a white spherical body with two long wings and a bird-like tail; he is supposed to be invisible and inaudible to the normal people, but he is able to show himself to them at will. Yuzuka and http://anidb.net/ch78242 [Chiya] always keep distance from him, despite his pursuits for intimate relationship with the girls. His taste is close to that of human, and he has a strong desire for delicious foods.\nSource: Wikipedia",
