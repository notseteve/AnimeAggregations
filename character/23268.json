  "description" : "Second year in Kasensou Private Prepatory Academy. Childhood friend of Rintarou`s, and slow by nature. Speaks in a very wavy manner, and seems to always be smiling and having fun. She`s quite the optimist. She has trouble understanding complicated theories, but doesn`t mind as long as it`s enjoyable. Doesn`t like people arguing, and is depressed when things are unpleasant. Though she`d like to ease the situation in such cases, she`s not really good at reading between the lines.",
