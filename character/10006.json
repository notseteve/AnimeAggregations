  "description" : "Juna is a girl in the tenth grade, who is recognised by Chris to be the \"Avatar of Time\", to save the planet. Besides possessing powers due to her \"Earth sympathy\", she is an ordinary teenage girl. She has a difficult time understanding her purpose, and is unsure how she is supposed to help the planet. Her personal life is also distressed, both with her mother and sister, and especially in her uncertain relationship with Tokio, whose thoughts she cannot figure out, and who similarly never manages to understand her feelings. While she attempts to succeed in her job, she cannot understand the message Chris is trying to explain until the very end, when she realizes the meaning of \"becoming one with the target\" that she repeats from the beginning of the series.",
