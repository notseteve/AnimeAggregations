  "description" : "Yukishiro Honoka is the quiet and reserved one, but that does not keep her from having her own friends and following. She can be quite strict and domineering when the situation calls for it. Her alter ego is Cure White. Honoka is very poised and intelligent and enjoys reading. Her specialty is the science club, where she is looked up to by the others. Honoka hasn`t had many friends, but the few she has seem to be really close to her. It has also been noted that she`s relatively popular with the boys, though she seems to have little interest in them.",
