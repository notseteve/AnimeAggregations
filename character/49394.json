  "description" : "Cameron`s Riolu is Cameron main Pokémon and it resides outside of its Pokéball. It seems to be very relaxed in nature and is often seen imitating Cameron gestures. Cilan`s tasting of it noted that even as a small grain, it`s spicy and he sees it as quite a virtuoso.\nIsshu League Higaki Tournament\nCameron`s Riolu participated in the Isshu League Higaki Tournament. In the first round, Bianca was matched up against Cameron. The final match up of the battle was between Cameron`s Riolu and Bianca`s Emboar. It was pretty one sided as Bianca`s Emboar was already pretty tired and it couldn`t land any hits. It was able to grab its foot at one point and throw it hard but Cameron`s Riolu landed on the ground upright. Cameron`s Riolu defeated Bianca`s Emboar and as a result Bianca was eliminated from the Isshu League tournament while Cameron advanced to the second round.\nIn the third round it was matched up against Kenton`s Gigalith and defeated it which resulted in Kenton being eliminated from the tournament.\nDuring the fourth round of the tournament against Ash, it evolved into Cameron`s Lucario.",
