In the beginning, she tells Satsuki she wants to marry Kippei when she grows up. She is very protective of Kippei but truly only wants him to be happy. During the whole series, Yuzuyu struggles with the absence of her mother and her wish to be with her. This conflicts with her wish to be with Kippei. At the very end of volume 7 we see her as a teenager who had written to Kippei a letter. It is hinted that the teenage Yuzuyu might be dating her childhood friend, Shouta. She loves to draw, and likes corn and shellfish.",
