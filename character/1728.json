  "description" : "This huge mobile armour is one of the products of Iron Mask`s secret Rafflesia Project. The Rafflesia resembles a giant flower, whose main body houses a battery of powerful beam cannons capable of destroying an Earth Federation battleship with one salvo, and whose five petals contain dozens of tentacular rods for grappling enemy mobile suits. The mobile armour is also equipped with an I-field generator whose barrier deflects all enemy beam weapons. Iron Mask controls the Rafflesia via mental commands, which are relayed through optical fibers connected to his distinctive helmet.\nThe Rafflesia, being Carozzo`s personal unit, was controlled by his brainwaves via a \"neo-psycommu\" system - an advancement on the classic psycommu technology. This system, which was composed of receptors in Iron Mask`s helmet connected to the mobile armour via a great number of fiber optic cables, allowed Carozzo to completely control all aspects of his machine without the use of manual controls.\nStored aboard the flagship Zamouth Gar, the Rafflesia was only deployed once near the end of the initial conflicts during the Crossbone Vanguard invasion of March UC 0123. Carozzo took his mobile armour into battle to kill his rebellious daughter Berah Ronah, who was trying to stop his plan to kill all humans living on Earth with his Bug weapons. Though his Rafflesia would deliver serious damage to Berah`s XM-07 Vigna Ghina, the mighty mobile armour would soon fall to Seabook Arno, who used some ingenious tricks taking advantage of the http://anidb.net/ch1726 [Gundam F91`s] abilities to cause the Rafflesia to destroy itself.",
