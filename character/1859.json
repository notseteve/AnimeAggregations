  "description" : "Satoshi is the older brother of Satoko Hojo. Although he is currently missing, his past influence is the key to the actions of several characters in Higurashi. Similar to Satoko, he cannot distinguish the difference between cauliflower and broccoli. Due to this, it can be inferred that both Satoshi and Satoko are color-blind. Satoshi is referred to by Satoko as nii-nii, a childish form of the Japanese word ani (meaning older brother).\nAccording to the TIPS in Meakashi-hen, he was last seen at a Nagoya train station boarding a Shinkansen bound for Tokyo. This was revealed prior to the start of Matsuribayashi-hen to be a result of him trying to run away from home due to his abuse, only to change his mind a few moments later. While it is suggested that he may have witnessed his aunt`s death in the games, In the anime, Satoshi is implied to have killed her or was so disturbed that he believed he did. Combined with the stress of taking care of Satoko and the murder, he succumbs to Hinamizawa Syndrome. In Matsuribayashi-hen, at least in the anime, and in Miotsukushi-hen, it is revealed that Doctor Irie put him under heavy sedation in the underground parts of the clinic, while in the visual novel equivalent, he is still alive yet his whereabouts are unknown.",
