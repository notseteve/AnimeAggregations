  "description" : "The Quinta Espada, signified by the \"5\" tattooed to his tongue. He wears a large eye-patch that covers most of the left side of his face, as well as the remnants of his hollow mask (a small set of jawbones and teeth) and his hollow hole, both located around his left eye socket. He has the self-proclaimed strongest hierro of any Espada, both past and present, enabling him to block attacks, even from blade wielding opponents, by his skin alone. He is very rude and lecherous, and firmly believes in male chauvinism.",
