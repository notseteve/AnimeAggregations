  "description" : "The principal of Tomobiki High School. A soft-spoken, balding, nearsighted middle-aged man, he treats all of the weird goings-on at the school as harmless student shenanigans. He occasionally instigates the weirdness, however, like the time the entire student body was called on to compete in teams to create the largest bust of himself possible using only rice paste. He is often seen sitting at the kotatsu in his office, sharing tea and taiyaki with his friend Kotatsu Neko. Not unlike Onsen-Mark, he has shown mild attraction to his female students (though no more than any other male, and never acting on it; it is more of an admiration than an attraction. He does admire any beauty when he sees it.). He first appeared in the second season.\nSource: Wikipedia",
