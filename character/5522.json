  "description" : "Hirasawa Ui is http://anidb.net/ch4424 [Yui]`s younger sister. However, unlike her older sister she is more responsible and handles household chores easily. Despite their differences, she shares a very strong relationship with her older sister and tends to look after her. However, she is so used to taking care of Yui that she doesn`t know what to do with herself when her older sister is away. Despite being a year younger than Yui, she looks practically identical to her older sister with her hair down. This has resulted in the other members of the light music club mistaking her for Yui on more than one occasion. Ui is also shown to be able to learn things quickly; she once picked up guitar and excelled at it after very little practice. At the end of the series, she joins the light music club with Jun and follows in her sister`s footsteps by becoming a guitarist. Like Yui, her surname is taken from Susumu Hirasawa.",
