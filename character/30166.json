  "description" : "Excluding the sealed up Bahlskra, Saitohimea is the last of the Vampires. In the story, `Vampire` is used as the furigana reading of `Most Ancient Sorcerer` (最古の 魔術師). Saitohimea is described to have mischievous crimson eyes, pink lips, and lavender colored hair which ends in a spectrum of colors. Since she was born, everyone around her has sought and hunted her for her powers, except for Taito, whom she fell in love with and subsequently formed a contract with. In order to revive the dead Taito, she exchanged most of her powers in order to revive him, but still retains a large amount compared to humans. She later joins Miyasaka High as a student, and together with Taito, becomes part of Gekkou`s student council and takes on the name of Himea Saito.\nSource: Wikipedia",
