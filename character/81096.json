She later becomes a member of http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts]` traveling party.\nDue to her upbringing and subsequent events, Farnese has a very complex but developing personality. Whenever she wanted she would whip, bite, and otherwise abuse http://anidb.net/ch81094 [Serpico] and even drink his blood. She does not know that he is her half-brother. As a child, she treated him as a possession, and she reminded him frequently of this status. Her lack of empathy due to her poor upbringing along with the praise she received in joining in a witch burning provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake. This fueled a secret sadistic pleasure that she constantly tried to deny.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
