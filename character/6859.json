  "description" : "A traumatised boy who lives a hermit`s existence in his room and does not go to school after cracking under the pressure of entrance exams. He suffers from what is known as toukou kyohi, or a refusal to go to school, as well as hikikomori, the phenomenon of isolating oneself from society.\nHe spends a lot of time in front of his computer, and has a hobby of ordering things from the Internet — mostly fake magical or occultic implements— and then returning them before he has to pay, for the thrill of receiving something ridiculously stupid. He is also interested in cars and collects miniature versions of them. When he comes into possession of Shinku and winds her up, he is unwittingly and unwillingly caught in the crossfire of the Alice Game — Shinku declares him to be her \"servant\" and demands that he obey her at all times. Jun is extremely skilled at crafts and at sewing. Although he is arrogant, and occasionally cold and rude, he cares for others but typically refuses to let his feelings show. He is especially friendly with Hinaichigo, and at times, blushes around Shinku, which portrays that he cares deeply for her.",
