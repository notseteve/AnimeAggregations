  "description" : "Thundurus is known as the Bolt Strike Pokémon. He is based on Raijin, the god of thunder and lightning. Thundurus can only be encountered in Pokémon White, after being seen causing massive thunderstorms around the Unova region. After it has been encountered once, it roams freely throughout the entire region until it is finally captured or defeated. The spikes on its tail discharge immense bolts of lightning. It flies around the Unova region firing off lightning bolts.\nIt was said to have been banished by Landorus after it and Tornadus were seen causing violent thunderstorms throughout the Unova Region.\nThundurus gains an alternate form in the upcoming games Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 after being obtained in the side game Pokémon Dream Radar (known in Japan as Pokémon AR Searcher). Thundurus`s Therian Forme resembles a dragon, and its original form is called the Incarnate Forme.",
