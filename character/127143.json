  "description" : "Horace is Goh`s friend that he met three years before the events of PM2019 32. Horace was looking for a Celebi in Azalea Town in the Johto region while Goh was looking for a Mew. The two of them spotted a Pokémon at the same time and each thought it was the Pokémon they were looking for. From that point on they became friends and decided to help each other.\nThey read about Celebi sightings at a small, ancient shrine in Ilex Forest and they went looking for it. On the first day, they couldn`t find it so they promised to meet back in the forest the next day. Unfortunately, Horace caught a fever and was sick and couldn`t meet up with Goh. Sorry that he missed keeping his promise, Horace found the shrine and left a note for Goh. Three years later, he found the note and read the explanation. Just as he finished reading the note, Horace showed up and the two reunited their friendship.",
