  "description" : "Yanmega, known as the Ogre Darner Pokémon, evolves from Yanma from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl by learning the attack Ancient Power and leveling up. In battle, it moves faster each turn with the ability Speed Boost or increases the power of ineffective attacks with Tinted Lens. It is one of the few evolving from the learned move Ancient Power (others are Mamoswine and Tangrowth), though there are other Pokémon who evolve from moves, but the moves differ between Pokémon. Ultrasonic waves coming from Yanmega`s wings can cause lethal damage to a foe`s internal organs. It is known as the largest Bug Pokémon. It also has the highest Special Attack stat of all Bug-type Pokémon. Yanmega resembles a giant dragonfly, as does its pre-evolution, Yanma. Both Yanma and Yanmega`s names are derived from \"Oniyanma\", the largest of dragonfly species in Japan.\nIn the anime, Jessie owns a Yanmega. She captured it as a Yanma and gave it to Giovanni, but he rejected it and sent it back to her. She then trained it herself and evolved into Yanmega in the same episode.",
