  "description" : "Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Rocky Field)\nDrake selected the first Pokémon in the battle and selected Ditto who the commentator pointed out that many trainers had lost their cool against ditto as they got frustration seeing their own attacks being launch against them.\nAsh responded by sending out Pikachu and Drake`s first move was to have Ditto transform into Pikachu. Ash`s first move was a Thunder attack but the transformed Ditto manage to shrug it off and launch a Thunder attack of its own that hit Ash`s Pikachu. Both trainers then order their Pokémon to use a Thunderbolt attack that struck each other and the power caused the rocks they were standing on to collaspe. Drake`s Ditto managed to land on its feet but Ash`s Pikachu fell on the arena floor. Pikachu struggled to get and Misty wanted Ash to switch Pokémon, however, Ash refused to beleive that Ditto, who was copying Pikachu, could beat the original.\nAsh stuck with Pikachu and Drake ordered his Ditto to use agility. Ash responded by having Pikachu use Thunderbolt but Ditto dodged it and launched a Thunderbolt attack of its own. Ash had Pikachu ground itself and took no damage from the attack, then, Pikachu used Agility to get close to Drake`s Ditto who was also using Agility and both Pokémon used Thunderbolt and collided in mid-air. Pikachu was the first Pokémon to get to its feet and swiped at Ditto using its tail whilst charged with electricity, knocking Ditto to the floor and eliminating it from the battle giving Ash the initial advantage.",
