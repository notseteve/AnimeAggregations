  "description" : "The Qubeley is the crowning technological achievement of the renegade Zeons who took refuge at the asteroid base Axis. Essentially a compact, humanoid version of the mobile armour MAN-08 Elmeth, the Qubeley is equipped with a fully functional psycommu system and an array of tiny remote-controlled weapon pods called \"funnels.\" Via the psycommu system, a Newtype pilot can use her thought waves to control both the Qubeley`s funnels and the mobile suit itself. However, the Axis forces have only one Newtype powerful enough to operate this amazing machine, and so the Qubeley has become the personal mobile suit of Axis leader Haman Karn.",
