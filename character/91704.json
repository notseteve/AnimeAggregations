Due to his size, he had no one to play with and nowhere to play either, so Kagura decided to play with him. He became rather attached to her and fell in love shortly afterwards.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch16867 [Princess Soyo] mentioned that his race is peaceful and quiet as long as they can listen to hip hop. Titan royalty have looked for their brides on other planets for generations.
