  "description" : "Kyouno Madoka is the sole member of a Jersey Club who often helps out other clubs and people in need and is passionate about her home town of Kamogawa. She has a habit of saying \"maru\" (meaning `circle`; in Japan these are used to indicate correct answers on tests) when she finishes helping someone. She soon discovers she has the ability to pilot a strange robotic aircraft known as the Vox Aura, which she previously encountered ten years ago when she almost drowned. She names this Vox unit Midori, after its green colour. In Season 2, she is in her last year of high school and has not thought what she is going to do for the future. She still helps out with the Jersey Club and her uncle`s new beach cafe.",
