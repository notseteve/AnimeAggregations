  "description" : "Lieutenant Kitsurubami is an attractive young woman and second in command on Amarao`s staff in the Interstellar Immigration Bureau. She is often seen either giving out vital mission data, or on the field in investigations with Amarao. Amarao hits on her in the final episode, but she resists him. In fact, Kitsurubami seems to be generally disgusted by the idea of romantic involvement (and likely any form of physical contact) with Amarao though she looks up to him as a superior and follows his orders loyally. She also seems to become smitten with Canti, despite her initial efforts to attack him with a large caliber sniper rifle.\nKitsurubami is named after a light brown traditional Japanese color, which happens to be the color of her skin. Thus, her name could be interpreted as \"Lieutenant Brown\", although the color Kitsurubami is not the common \"brown.\" She appears to be the only \"normal\" (or mature) adult in FLCL.",
