  "description" : "Duke is a red-and black striped and green-eyed magical frog who is the familiar of Chocolat. He tries to help her steal hearts, however he isn`t much help at the beginning, and seems to think that he is hopeless with her. He has a rivalry with Blanca. Mostly, he is quite lazy and rude, he proves to be friendly and harmless, and has an extensive knowledge about hearts which prove to be useful later on. Duke is actually a little brother of Cinnamon who was transformed into a frog shortly after her betrayal to the magical world, trying to hid himself for protecting Cinnamon. At the end of Volume 6 he is returned to his human form via a white heart.\nHis real name is Poivre which is French for pepper. Duke is English for a noble rank.",
