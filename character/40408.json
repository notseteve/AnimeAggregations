It battled against Cilan`s Stunfisk. Luke`s Larvesta used String Shot as an attack and a defense in the battle which showed Cilan that Luke knew how to battle with his Larvesta. Luke`s Larvesta also used its flames like a hovering jet which gave it a bit of flying mobility. It ended up defeating Cilan`s Stunfisk with a powerful Flamethrower allowing Luke to move on to the next round in the tournament.",
