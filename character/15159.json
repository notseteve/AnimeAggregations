  "description" : "A mysterious girl who lives in http://anidb.net/ch17768 [Arakawa]. She is a self-claimed Venusian and also http://anidb.net/ch15161 [Kou]`s girlfriend. The origin of her name comes from the sweat-suit she wears has the tag reading 2-3 (in Japanese pronounced as \"Ni-no-San\") on it. She commonly goes fishing in the river and it is her job in the village to provide fish for them. She easily forgets stuff and that`s why she needs http://anidb.net/ch15161 [Kou] to live in the village, because if he doesn`t, she`ll forget about him. Her home is constructed of cardboard and her bed is made out of velvet, although she chooses to sleep in the drawer under the bed. If she becomes frightened or angry, she`ll pull her sweat-suit over her head and climbs on top of a street lamp.",
