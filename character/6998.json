  "description" : "Evangelion Unit 02, built by Nerv Germany, is the first Production Model Eva. It is piloted by Souryuu Asuka Langley and is the first Evangelion built specifically for combat. The Eva`s armour is primarily red with yellow and white on the arms and head. The head armour has two movable sections, one covering both the jaw and lower eyes and the other above the upper pair of eyes. These plates are hinged and can shift, displaying the Eva`s eyes underneath. This is first seen underwater during the fight with Gaghiel. As a result of being constructed by Nerv Germany, and also as an accommodation for its three-quarters-German pilot, its default language setting is German. Unit 02 features a different progressive knife from earlier Eva units as well as an internal weapon rack in the right shoulder binder which fires dartlike weapons.\nUnlike Unit 01, it only goes truly \"berserk\" once, just before its destruction. It has achieved an unusually high sync ratio with its pilot(s), on two other occasions: once in combat against the 6th angel Gaghiel, and once under the influence of the 17th Angel. It is known to contain the maternal part of the soul of Asuka`s mother.\nUnit 02 has blue blood, which is first seen when the fourteenth Angel, Zeruel, cuts off its arms. It has brown skin and four orange eyes, first seen when the MP Evas tear it apart.",
