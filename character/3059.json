  "description" : "Matsuge was the camel who accompanied the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hats] during the Arabasta arc. He would only let http://anidb.net/ch476 [Nami] and http://anidb.net/ch2940 [Vivi] ride, and, in her admiration, Nami named him \"Eyelashes\". He refused to let anyone else on, prompting the rest of the crew to beat him up and label him as a pervert (because he only let the two women ride). He also disguised himself as Vivi by riding a Spot-Billed Duck and wearing a white cape. He was paired up with http://anidb.net/ch478 [Usopp] and got chased by http://anidb.net/ch3020 [Mr. 2]. He was as weak as Usopp since Mr. 2 only needed one second for each of them. After the Arabasta arc, Eyelashes was ordered to be given special treatment, as well as being allowed to join the Super Spot-Billed Duck Squad (even though he`s a camel), as revealed in the cover of Chapter 271.",
