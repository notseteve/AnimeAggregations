  "description" : "Regirock is a legendary Pokémon in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Pokémon Emerald that can only be caught in the Desert Ruins once in each game. It was sealed there long before the series. It can also be found inside of a cave in Pokémon Ranger. It will be obtainable in Pokémon Platinum in a cave at Route 228 only if the special Regigigas from the eleventh movie is transferred to the Platinum game. Being made completely out of rock, it has no brain or heart, which baffles the scientists of the Pokémon universe. Regirock along with its brothers Regice and Registeel often fill guardian roles; they are normally guarding their king, (Regigigas), but they also have been seen at The Tree of Beginning, and guarding (Mew). The various rocks that it is composed of come from different locations. If damaged in battle, it will repair itself with rocks it finds nearby.\nIt also appears to represent the Stone Age just like fellow Regis, Regice who represents the Ice Age, Registeel who represents the Iron Age and Regigigas who represents the time of Pangaea.",
