  "description" : "Freya was the first Chobit, who was created before Elda by Ichiro Mihara. Freya was created to be Hibiya`s daughter, because she was unable to bear children of her own. She lived happily with the Mihara couple for a time until Hibiya noticed that her attitude was becoming increasingly melancholy. Hibiya asked her husband to build a little sister for Freya in an attempt to make her happy again; from this request, Elda was created.",
