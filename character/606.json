  "description" : "Slowking is one of the two different species Slowpoke can evolve into, Slowbro being the other. Slowking`s appearance is essentially identical to that of Slowpoke, with a few additions: it stands upright, it sports a red-and-white ruff around its neck and it has a bone-like structure on top of its head that is a cross between a helmet and a crown. This is actually a different form of Shellder, similar to the one biting Slowbro`s tail. When Slowking is viewed from behind, the eyes of the Shellder can be seen. The Shellder biting Slowking`s head injects toxins inside its brain every time Slowking yawns. The poisons interact with Slowking`s neural tissue to unlock mental faculties hitherto untapped, making Slowking considerably smarter and more alert than the sluggish Slowpoke or Slowbro. This makes it stand out among the aforementioned species, which recognize it as a leader of sorts.\nThe anime adds a ritualistic test to select the leader of the Slowpoke and Slowbro. A group of Slowpoke gather in a Shellder-infested lake, at the middle of which laid a King`s Rock. The Slowpoke that manages to dodge the Shellder and avoid evolving into Slowbro make it to the King`s Rock and places it on its head, whereupon a Shellder clamps on the rock, triggering Slowpoke`s evolution into Slowking.\nSome Slowking have shown themselves capable of learning human speech, as seen in the movie Pok√©mon 2000 in which one helps Ash restore order to the world by getting three spheres protected by Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.",
