  "description" : "Natsume is a Japanese woman who acts as both a representative of Canaan`s employer and her informant, working for a Non-Governmental Organization called OWL. She is calm and punctual, as attested by the way she interacts with Canaan despite initially being very much annoyed by the latter`s single-mindedness for avenging Siam`s death. She is an acquaintance of Santana and usually gives him advices to treat Hakko well. It is later revealed that she really works for the Defense Intelligence Headquarters with the rank of Major, using the Ua virus incidents and manipulating the US and China in order to get Japan to an advantageous position in the international politics arena.\nSource: Wikipedia",
