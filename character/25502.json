  "description" : "Bismarck was developed by Marian Louvre as the technological miracle weapon, with which mankind could oppose the Outriders. Although it can be flown by one person, the ship is designed to be operated by four people, each sitting in separate units that control specific functions: navigation (Marian), gunner unit (Bill), pilot (Shinji) and the tactician (Richard). Once the transformation sequence is initiated the ship transforms into an enormous combat robot.\nThe battle conversion to robot form is used mainly when the Star Sheriffs encounter the Outrider`s form of giant robot, which is known as a Renegade or Desperado Unit.\nA highlight of every episode is Bismarck`s transformation from an airborne battleship into a giant robot. Bismarck will transform into a giant robot packing an oversized six-shooter at the hip, and appears to be wearing a cowboy hat and a cape. In Maverick Quick-draw mode, an array of assorted cannons will be deployed at Bismarck`s chest, delivering the final blow to send an Outrider Renegade Unit back to the Vapor Zone.",
