  "description" : "Saigō Takamori (Takanaga) (西鄕 隆盛 (隆永), January 23, 1828 – September 24, 1877) was one of the most influential samurai in Japanese history and one of the three great nobles who led the Meiji Restoration. Living during the late Edo and early Meiji periods, he has been dubbed the last true samurai. Eventually Saigō and his final remaining samurai were encircled and annihilated at the Battle of Shiroyama. Saigo`s death brought the Satsuma Rebellion to an end. [Source: Wikipedia]",
