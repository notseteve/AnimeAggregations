  "description" : "Matsukaze is http://anidb.net/ch41595 [Reiha]`s talking doll companion. His name means \"wind of the pines\", which in Japan represents an unshakable force, fidelity, conjugal love. He doesn`t hide his contempt for http://anidb.net/ch41591 [Miyu].\nHe is in a sense Reiha`s surrogate father into which she has projected all her hostility and anger towards Miyu. In the final confrontation, Matsukaze used his ice abilities to trap Larva in an ice barrier so Reiha could fight Miyu; he later sacrificed himself to protect Reiha from Miyu`s flame attack.\nSource: wiki",
