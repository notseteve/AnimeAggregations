  "description" : "Kirio is the main antagonist. He and Kirika are adopted by Kirihiko while they were children. He is the student council president of Sakuragaoka Academy. He tests the protagonists and fights them outside the campus. Karin refers to him as \"Mr. Glasses Man\" (meganekko), \"Four eyes-san\" or \"Glasses Guy\". His only true relative is his twin sister Kirika, but he does have another \"sister\" by the name of Himeka. In the anime, he is a running gag character; often leaving before ever winning and revealing his plot to Karin and the others while they didn`t know, thinking they did. His ring has the powers of the god Ares. Later in the series, his ring is destroyed by Kazune. He then gets possessed by his father, Kirihiko, by the Zeus ring he wore after his broke, but in the end Karin and Kazune saved him. (Episode 26) He then returns in Chu. Now, with the other Himeka, he is trying to create a new Zeus ring using the `seed of chaos`,in order to save the future Kirika who is sick. To do that, he has to revive his father, whom currently resides within Kuga Jin.",
