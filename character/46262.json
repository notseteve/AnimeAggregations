  "description" : "Malin is a cheerful and innocent girl who works at Windy Station en route to Roshan City. Ash and his friends got off the train for three minutes to buy some special Darumakka Lunch boxes that she makes. They also got three bags of Oran Berry ices for dessert and three bottles each of spring water and ice tea. When customers finish their lunch which is in the Darumakka box, they can use it as a decoration wind chime. Cilan noted that he enjoyed the gentle sound that it made blowing in the wind.",
