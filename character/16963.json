  "description" : "Maeno Kouki is a young man with distorted memory whom http://anidb.net/ch16960 [Rin] accidentally saves in episode one. He is, in fact, a clone created by Aoyama Pharmaceutical company. The original Kouki Maeno died during an experiment that involved his vivisection. His memory lacks realism as it is actually the memory of the original Kouki written into the clone`s brain by artificial means. After discovering the truth, he chooses to keep on living and began working at Asougi Consulting, where he spends the next twenty-one years. Some time between episodes two and three, he marries http://anidb.net/ch17292 [Shimazaki Yuki] and has a son named Teruki with her. In episode three, he is shot by http://anidb.net/ch17287 [Sayara] while rescuing Rin, and has to consume Shougo Shimazaki`s time spore in order to survive as an angel. After saving Rin and having one last tender moment with her, he returns to consume Sayara, but is killed (unlike that of immortals, the death of an angel is permanent regardless the time spore) by Apos before he can finish. Kouki`s time spore is lost in the sea but is inexplicably found by Rin while she regenerates in the ocean between episodes four and five. His granddaughter Mishio acquires it after Rin`s body is destroyed in episode five, unwittingly brings it to Apos` castle in episode six, and passes it to Rin as the latter is consumed by Yggdrasil. Kouki`s spirit then helps Rin to break free.",
