  "description" : "Suzuna is a cute blue-haired girl who`s always wearing rollerblades. She came to the United States and hitched a ride with one of the bikers of a bike gang. Sena first met her after he got lost halfway through the Death March and was surrounded by a whole lot of American bikers.\nLater, Suzuna follows the team back to Japan after her brother accepts Sena`s offer to join the Devil Bats (he didn`t get picked for the American football team he was trying to enter). She then becomes a cheerleader for the Devil Bats even though she`s not from Deimon High School (and the captain for the otherwise all-American cheerleading team).",
