  "description" : "Yoichi is very effeminate man of nineteen. Although he lived hundreds of years before http://anidb.net/ch79269 [Nobunaga] and http://anidb.net/ch79268 [Toyohisa], Yoichi is the youngest in the group. Born as the youngest of eleven siblings, Yoichi is a powerful warrior and military commander who served http://anidb.net/ch83938 [Minamoto no Yoshitsune] during the Genpei War. Yoichi`s exploits were recorded throughout Japanese history, including in The Tale of the Heike, though Nobunaga notes that Yoichi acts very differently from these historical accounts. During the Genpei War, he was forced to commit several dishonorable acts by Yoshitsune, despite having a strong belief of Bushido.\nNow as a http://anidb.net/ch86429 [Drifter], Yoichi resolves to maintain his honorable nature, and is the most level-headed of the trio. Yoichi acts as the group`s archer, killing fleeing enemies.\nSource: Wikipedia",
