  "description" : "Kaiou is the kaiou of the northern quadrant of the galaxy. His companion is a pet monkey named http://anidb.net/ch11405 [Bubbles] and in anime adaptation, http://anidb.net/a1530 [Dragon Ball Z], he also has a flying cricket companion named http://anidb.net/ch11406 [Gregory]. If a fighter that was allowed to keep his body manages to reach his small planet at the end of Hebi no Michi (Snake Way in the English adaptations), Kaiou trains them. Before training any students though, he forces them to appeal to his strange sense of humor, catch Bubbles, and hit Gregory with a mallet.",
