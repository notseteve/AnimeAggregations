  "description" : "Porygon-Z, known as the Virtual Pokemon, is the evolution of Porygon2 from Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl onwards. It is evolved when traded with an item called the Dubious Disc. Porygon-Z`s appearance is similar to that of Porygon and Porygon2, which were supposedly earlier designs by Silph Co. The programming added to create Porygon-Z was intended to allow it to surpass all other Pokemon, but as a result, Porygon-Z began to exhibit odd behaviors and the data used to program it became glitched giving it its odd appearance.\nPorygon`s evolutionary line is notable for being the only evolutionary line that contains two evolutions triggered through trading. Porygon-Z is notable for having the highest Special Attack, one of two statistics that influence the power of an attack, among non-legendary Pokemon. It shares this title with another Pokemon, Alakazam.\nHowever after the notorious episode of Pokemon causing seizures to many Japanese viewers (Dennou Senshi Porygon), Porygon-Z has never appeared in the Pokemon anime.",
