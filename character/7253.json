  "description" : "Otonashi Kyouko is a beautiful, 22-year-old widow who takes on the task of managing a broken-down boarding house.\nShe lives in the manager`s room (with no room number, a reference to the 無 in her name meaning \"zero\" or \"null\").\nShe is sweet and polite, but she also has a violent, frightening side that emerges when she is jealous - a trait she has in common with other Rumiko Takahashi heroines, e.g., Akane Tendou (from Ranma ½), Lum Invader and Shinobu Miyake (from Urusei Yatsura), Sister Angela (from One-Pound Gospel), Kagome Higurashi and Sango (from InuYasha) - or dealing with her meddling parents.\nShe soon develops affection for Yuusaku, and has a tendency to dote over him (the other tenants tease her for acting \"like a good wife\") and sometimes becomes jealous around him (though she denies it is jealousy). However, it is hard for her to forget about her late husband \"Mr. Soichirou\" (Soichirou-san, who died just six months after the wedding), and her memories of her husband sometimes put her in a melancholic mood. Kyouko`s love for him is sometimes reflected in dialogues with her dog, who bears the same name as her late husband.\nShe is two years older than Godai and being a widow is one of the many worries she has later on about whether she will be accepted as his fiancée.",
