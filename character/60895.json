  "description" : "Karasu is a Quest-class demon. Like Bui, Karasu fought against the Toguro brothers and lost and subsequently became a member of Team Toguro. He is able to use his aura to create bombs undetectable by lower level demons, as well as create bombs within his victims. Karasu displays sadistic tendencies during his fights and delights in torturing and humiliating his opponents. He wears a mask over his mouth which restricts his unstable powers. He is also able to use his entire body as an explosive.\nSource: Wikipedia",
