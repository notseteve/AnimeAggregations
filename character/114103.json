  "description" : "Willem Holland was an Alliance vice admiral who commanded the 11th Fleet by 794 UC, taking part in the Third Battle of Tiamat. Holland became a vice admiral at the age of 32, which prompted some to compare him to the Alliance war hero Bruce Ashbey. At Tiamat, he charged into the main Imperial formation and inflicted significant casualties, but concentrated artillery fire from the nearby Lohengramm Fleet destroyed his flagship Epimetheus and killed him.\nSource: Gineipedia",
