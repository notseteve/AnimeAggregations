  "description" : "The destroid Monster Heavy Weight Robot was originally designed as another anti-giant combat system but it first saw action fighting terrestrial threats during the events surrounding the Island of Mayan in 2008. The Mk.I Monster was nearly identical to the later http://anidb.net/ch48862 [Mk.II Monster] and was primarily deployed as a mobile artillery unit. However, the Monster was not designed for missile launchers on either side of the unit and thus the Mk.I had two multi-purpose \"arms\" for ammunition delivery, firing position adjustment and other duties. When the decision was made to equip the Monster with missile launchers, the unit was renamed Mk.II.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/monstermki.htm",
