  "description" : "Sayuri is Mai Kawasumi`s only friend before she meets Yuichi, and thus her biggest part is in Mai`s story. She is the daughter of a wealthy family, and always tries to smile and help others. She uses more formal Japanese honorifics for Yuichi when she addresses him, even when they become close friends. Sayuri cares very deeply about Mai, as it shows since they not only hang out together constantly, but Sayuri will get worried if Mai is in trouble; she also never forgets Mai`s birthday. Initially, she is completely ignorant about the demons but even though some begin to target her near the end of Mai`s story, she stubbornly stays by Mai`s side. Sayuri, as with Ayu and Makoto, has a cute quirk; when she laughs, she voices a distinct ahaha. Sayuri always addresses herself in the third person due to an event in her past.",
