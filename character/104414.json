  "description" : "After being defeated by Libra Genbu, Tokisada drags Haruto and Ryuhou to the end of time where he is defeated by Haruto, who finally manages to avenge his friend by awakening his Seventh Sense. Tokisada returns as a Secondary Pallasite, having apparently been saved from the end of time by his new Chrono Tector. As a Pallasite, he wields a clock known as the Death Watch (デスウォッチ Desu Wotchi) that directs his time-based powers, which he now uses as an armor. He easily holds his own against Eden and Haruto, but Subaru`s mysterious Cosmo distracts him long enough for Hyoga to arrive, pitting the former Aquarius Saints against each other. Hyoga`s Absolute Zero Cold Air is too strong for Tokisada`s Chrono Dominion, and Tokisada is left frozen solid.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
