  "description" : "The only male Topless on the \"Idol\" team, Nicola is the pilot of Buster Machine Vingt-Sept and, before Lal`C`s inclusion into the ranks of the Topless, was considered one of the most powerful Topless of his generation. He is Lal`C`s inspiration (in as much as Lal`C is Nono`s inspiration), and seems to have a relationship with her, though it is debatable whether it is of a romantic nature or not. He is interested in Nono and sees potential in her to be a Buster Machine pilot, despite the fact that Nono has never manifested any kind of Topless reaction (something that, according to their minder Casio, may not be possible in artificial beings), and secretly helps Nono join the Fraternity under the premise of being an \"auxiliary\" member.\nConsidered \"old\" among the current Topless (as he is nearing late adolescence), Nicola is already having a hard time manifesting the Exotic Maneuvers needed to power his machine. As such, he seems to secretly be seeking a way to extend his \"tenure\" as a Topless, to the point of joining the Serpentine Twin`s inner circle and acting as their watcher over Nono`s activities.\nHe ultimately loses his ability to pilot the Buster machine and becomes a lieutenant in the empire.",
