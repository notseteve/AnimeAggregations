  "description" : "Madarame Ikkaku is a typical member of the eleventh squad; he is loud, abrasive and itching for a battle. Much like http://anidb.net/ch7623 [Kenpachi], Ikkaku sees fighting as truly enjoyable and has a strong sense of honour insisting that all bouts should be one on one and to the death. Though he is a formidable opponent, Ikkaku is often teased within the division for his baldness, which has given him somewhat of a complex about it. Ikkaku`s zanpakutou is http://anidb.net/ch10804 [Hoozukimaru], which transforms into a double-ended spear when in its Shikai form.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
