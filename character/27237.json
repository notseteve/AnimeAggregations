  "description" : "Aloe`s Miruhog was revealed at the Shippo City Museum when it was sent out to battle against the poltergeist. It was able to help get the mask off of Dent and help discover that the poltergeist was a Desumasu that dropped its mask when it was sleeping. Kidachi stated that Miruhog is an amazing Pok√©mon that is very obedient to Aloe and helps guards the museum.\nDuring the first gym battle against Ash`s Oshawott, it used Mean Look so Ash`s Oshawott couldn`t be switched out. Since Ash`s Oshawott wasn`t expecting to battle Aloe`s Miruhog at that time, it was at a disadvantage and it was in a bad mood. Dent stated during the battle that Aloe`s Miruhog was brilliant at making use of stillness and motion. After Ash`s Oshawott lost its shell during the battle, Aloe`s Miruhog was able to use its Thunderbolt effectively to knock Ash`s Oshawott out of the match.",
