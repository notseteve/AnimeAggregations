She agrees with http://anidb.net/ch40602 [Seiryuu]`s plan of using http://anidb.net/ch5895 [Kyouta] as the control by a mindbreaker can only be broken by another mindbreaker. When http://anidb.net/ch40599 [Suzaku] considers this plan too dangerous, Genbu demands action or else she would break away from http://anidb.net/ch40598 [Arayashiki].",
