  "description" : "Koko`s best friend and a Japanese expert of robotics. She is a butterfly fanatic. When she decided to chase after butterflies in the mountains she cried and begged Koko for her forgiveness since she was going to end up missing their meeting which Miami had been looking forward to for a year. There is a secret plot between her and Koko, codenamed \"Jormungand\". Like Koko, Miami also has a habit of rolling around on nearby surfaces when she`s upset.\nSource: Wikipedia",
