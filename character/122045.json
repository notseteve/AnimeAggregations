  "description" : "Virizion is one of the members of the Sacred Swordsman and was one of the Pokémon that helped Keldeo learn the true weight of its sword to become part of the Sacred Swordsman. Virizion is awesome and is always keeping her cool. Amongst the Sacred Swordsman, she`s the smartest and the fastest Pokémon.\nWhile attempting to help save Keldeo from Kyruem, it was frozen in ice. It wasn`t until Keldeo returned to face Kyruem again with Ash Ketchum and his friends that it was released from the ice. After Keldeo proved to be worthy to become a Sacred Swordsman, Virizion had no objections and agreed that Keldeo should join them.\nThe English dub has an odd pronunciation of the legendary Pokémon Virizion (ビリジオン) and it makes it sound exactly the same as Verizon, a large telco in the United States. It`s unclear why they would want to make such a horrible pronunciation of the name to confuse it with a large companies name which is trademarked. The Japanese version of the movie does not pronounce it the same way and the English dub should have stayed consistent with its pronunciation.",
