  "description" : "GEAR vice-commander. Has her face hidden behind a mask, and has distinctive long blonde hair. Her superhuman battle prowess and agility in combination with her powerful weapon-laden motorcycle \"Valkyrie\" allows her to support Dendoh in the flesh. Uses a whip-like weapon, throwing blades, and explosives with great skill.\nShe is actually Hokuto Kusanagi`s mother Orie Kusanagi, who masks herself and wears a wig to disguise herself as Vega. Her appearance as Orie Kusanagi is also somewhat of a disguise, though, as she was an alien girl that crashed to earth with the Data Weapons and utilizes hair dye and contacts to conceal her original turquoise hair and eyes.",
