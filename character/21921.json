On his head he wears a striped bandanna with a standard tricone captain`s hat with what appears to be his Jolly Roger on it, a skull wearing an animal-like hood. He also wears a dark blue, open shirt with the sleeves rolled up and a ruffled collar, and elaborate earrings made up by three little jewels each on both ears.",
