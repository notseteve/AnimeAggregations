  "description" : "An idol band formed by a talent agency. The band is made up of Aya (Vo.), who has spent huge amounts of time training for her debut; celebrity and child actor Chisato (Ba.), and modeling sensation Eve (Key.). They were later joined by Hina (Gt.), who passed the band`s auditions and then studio musician Maya (Dr.). The five of them are using this experience to bolster their very own definition of an \"idol\" and what is it to be one.\nSource: bandori.fandom.com",
