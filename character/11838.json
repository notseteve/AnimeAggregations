  "description" : "Inugami Kotarou was one of Chigusa`s helpers in the Kyoto Arc. Due to changes in the script, he didn`t appear in the series, but happily debuted in the OAD`s.\nKotarou is an experienced fighter and charm-user, also, as a dog hanyou, he has the abilities to summon dog spirits and to shapeshift into different beast forms. He created a whole fighting style, built around his strengths, the Garyuu Inugami-ryuu. Because of his nature, his childhood was filled with hardships. He was forced to survive doing shady jobs as a mercenary. Despite that, he is cheerful and chivalrous, though slightly hot-headed. He is Negi`s self-proclaimed rival, and his best friend (though Kotarou himself denies that).",
