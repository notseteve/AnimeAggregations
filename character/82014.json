  "description" : "The Triglav was an http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Alliance] warship that served as a flagship for Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch741 [Dusty Attenborough].\nThe Triglav served as a squadron flagship, joining the http://anidb.net/ch96406 [Yang Fleet] at its formation in late 796 UC. Its first battle was against the 11th Fleet in the Battle of Doria, where Commodore Attenborough`s squadron drew the squadron of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch809 [Stocks] away from the rest of the http://anidb.net/ch96433 [11th Fleet].\nThe Triglav was next engaged in a small, inconclusive battle with the fleet of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch816 [Eihendorf], part of the http://anidb.net/ch190 [Kempff] Fleet, in 798 UC, whilst it was on a training cruise. Later that year, it defended http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] at the Eighth Battle of Iserlohn, and again in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, when High Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] attacked the fortress as part of Operation Ragnarok from late 798 UC to early 799 UC.\nJoining the rest of the Yang Fleet in evacuating the fortress, the Triglav fought in the subsequent battles of the war leading up to the Battle of Vermilion in 799 UC.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
