  "description" : "Chikage is the beast of Ayane. He sometimes appears in the shape of a human. Unlike the other beasts, Chikage has grown too large to leave the mansion, also limiting Ayane`s capability of traveling. As Chikage is very protective of Ayane due to her health, he needs some time to be persuaded by Shino to have the foxes accompany her outside.",
