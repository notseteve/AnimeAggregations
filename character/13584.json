  "description" : "Masayuki is the son of http://anidb.net/ch6991 [Nanjou Terumasa] who inherited his father`s clinic on Niijima after his death in 1986. Due to his family`s sensitivity to Terumasa`s death, Masayuki is resentful of the media for its rather flippant depiction of the murder incident on Rokkenjima, and prefers to keep quiet about it. He is interrogated by http://anidb.net/ch12641 [Ange] during her own investigation of the incident, only opening up to her as a fellow victim who lost her family.",
