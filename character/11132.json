  "description" : "This elegant Newtype mobile armor carries a complement of remote-controlled weapons called \"Bits,\" each of which has its own mega particle cannon, sensors, and rocket thrusters. A sufficiently powerful Newtype pilot, like Ensign Lalah Sune, can use these wireless Bits to attack enemies at immense distances. The Elmeth is also a powerful fighting machine in its own right - fast, maneuverable, and armed with a pair of lethal mega particle cannons.",
