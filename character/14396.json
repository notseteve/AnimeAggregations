  "description" : "Jakotsu is the second strongest of the Band of Seven and the third in command. He has been a close friend of their leader, Bankotsu, since before the group`s formation and is still the only person Bankotsu trusts.Jakotsu`s chief weapon, the Snake Sword or Jakotsuto, has segmented retractable blades that curve out across a great distance, making it difficult for an opponent to calculate his next move. Jakotsu is depicted acting in a homosexual manner, such as admiring Koga`s loincloth and claiming to have feelings for InuYasha, but because of his sadistic qualities, he basically wants to kill them in what he considers to be an affectionate way.",
