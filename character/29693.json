  "description" : "Vice Head Chef of the Bishoku-kai. He can suck up large amounts of food with his giant straw and has an extra pair of arms. He has the same eyes as Kuromado and Yuu except he has three pupils in each eye instead of just one. For transportation and food collection, he has a pet Jack Elephant (CLVL 85), which is large and strong enough to cut down an entire ear of BB Corn and carry it. He seems to be very lazy as he does not fulfill his mission of retrieving the GT Robos because he does not feel like fighting the Gourmet Association`s second and third. Another example of his laziness is that he does not finish the full names of places and things, calling the Regal Plateau the \"Regal-whatever\" and the Devil`s Athletics the \"Athletics-looking place.\" He agrees with Stajun that it is hard to not test Toriko`s strength. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members that Alfaro says are capable of entering the Gourmet World.",
