  "description" : "A classmate of the main characters. Aoi is a yuri fan, in particular she loves the works of the female shoujo novelist Masaka Orino. The real life profile of this author has been kept hidden from the audience, but she figures her as \"gorgeous and romantic\", living in a \"pretty Western-style house, surrounded by flowers or dolls\". Masaka Orino, however, is a man, and he`s Ushio`s brother, writing under a pen name. Sumika knows this but she doesn`t want to disappoint her, so she keeps it secret. Aoi thinks that love between girls must be something completely pure and fragile, hidden away from people`s eyes; for this reason she doesn`t like Tomoe and Miyako`s relationship, considering them way too blatant. She likes attending yuri-only events and writing yuri doujinshi, and she wishes to do that together with Sumika.",
