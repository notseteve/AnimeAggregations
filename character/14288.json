  "description" : "A Chinese werewolf girl who is always seen eating hard candies, along with a audible biting sound where one is usually supposed to suck on such candy. She can also use said hard candies as a weapon, flicking them as if they were bullets. What she is up to is currently shrouded in mystery, but has helped Akira a number of times. She carries a replica pendant reminding her of a precious friend of hers which Akira recalls in his memories. So far it appears she is loyal to Mina, and it even appears it was her who got her on the hard candies. She claims her measurements are 83-58-85 and that she is a virgin. She replaces Seiji Hama in his role as one of the three assassins; this is due to her ability with the shot gun, which is similar in technique to that of Seiji Hama. Her choice of the type of shotgun is also similar. Despite the fact that there are no female werewolves, this anime was made before Angel revealed this in the manga.",
