  "description" : "Phanpy is a midget-size elephant that has a large snout that serves various purposes. Its large ears act as fans to cool it down. Phanpy possesses the strength to lift an adult human; playful behavior with one may prove dangerous. It lives in nests that are vertical holes dug at a river`s shore. The area around the nest is claimed by Phanpy by marking it with its trunk, warning other Pok√©mon to keep out. In the mornings, Phanpy uses its trunk by the river`s edge to give itself a shower. When many Phanpy gather, they soak each other wet with their trunks, and dry at the edge of the water.",
