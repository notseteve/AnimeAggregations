Since Team Rocket ripped up the Pokemon Center`s battlefield, he agreed to referee the match on an open plain next to Lake Acuity.\nOsabaki was unaware that Team Rocket was behind the `repairs` of the Pokemon Center`s battlefield and that they were his assistants for the match due to their clever disguises.",
