  "description" : "A N.U.N.S. General Staff second lieutenant attached to the Macross Frontier, she is also the President`s daughter. Both beautiful and intelligent, Catherine is revealed to be a former Miss Macross winner, and later went on to serve on the judging panel in the 2059 contest. After having graduating from university with honors, she joined NUNS and is being fast-tracked into the elite. Though a very competent officer, she sometimes lacks flexibility. She had a relationship with Leon Mishima without her father`s knowledge and was formerly in a relationship with Ozma Lee before that. She became part of the SMS Macross Quarter crew during a mission to rescue the Macross Galaxy fleet from the Vajra. Like Ozma, she had grown suspicious of Leon`s intentions and confronted him only to be arrested by his men.",
