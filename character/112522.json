  "description" : "Ramune is a doctor who specializes in treating patients with \"mystery diseases\", which are caused when something \"strange\" sneaks into the hearts of the weak-minded. He is a foul-mouthed physician who is rude to most and very rarely understands the atmosphere around him. However, he is a very skilled doctor who can quickly identify the root cause of any strange illness. But because he always puts his patients first, he tries not to treat them too harshly.\nSource: Official page",
