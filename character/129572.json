  "description" : "Golisopod is Guzma`s main partner Pokémon. It`s Run Away ability is actually a metaphor for Guzma himself.\nIn the Alola Pokémon League quarterfinals fourth match, Guzma`s Golisopod battled against Lana`s Primarina. Lana was concerned about the move First Impression as it had caught Ash Ketchum off-guard during his battle with Guzma at the Pokémon School. Guzma chose not to use that move and used Throat Chop to make Primarina`s voice bad. Golisopod controlled the battle from the start to finish and it cut the Oceanic Operetta Z-Move attack in half with its Liquidation to knock out Primarina.\nIn the second match of the Alola Pokémon League semifinals, Guzma`s Scizor faced off against Ash`s Torracat but Scizor quickly used U-turn and Guzma`s Golisopod came out to battle. Torracat held its own in that matchup and Golisopod fled, forcing Scizor to appear on the battlefield where it took a direct hit from Fire Blast and was knocked out. Golisopod was forced back on the battlefield and it managed to poison Torracat. Despite things not going as he planned, Guzma still vowed to win and Golisopod knocked out Torracat which then setup the rematch battle against Pikachu. Ash changed up the tactics from their last battle and they managed to get a Thunderbolt hit right to the gut of Golisopod, finally taking down its defense. With both Pokémon having taken a lot of damage, Pikachu used the Z-Move Gigavolt Havoc but Golisopod withstood it. Determined to win the match, Pikachu`s Iron Tail landed the final blow to defeat Golisopod.",
