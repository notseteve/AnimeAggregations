  "description" : "Tifania Westwood is a well-endowed half-elf who lived in a forest in Albion. Saito remembers her as \"the big-breasted fairy who saved his life\" during the war between Tristain and Albion. She`s the daughter of the Archduke of Albion and an elf woman who was his mistress; as such, she is the last of Albion`s royal line. Her parentage also makes her http://anidb.net/ch4057 [Henrietta]`s cousin, as the Archduke was also Henrietta`s uncle.\nShe later discovers she is a Void Mage, sought out by Sheffield and Joseph, with the spell of `Memory Wipe` that erases people short memory events (also can wipe out magical compulsion on the mind), and that her familiar is Saito, who as a result, has two masters.\nSource: Wiki",
