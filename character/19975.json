Fukuda had already won an honorable mention when he tried for the Tezuka Award and also got seventh place in the same issue of Akamaru Jump in which http://anidb.net/ch20022 [Ashirogi Muto]`s Money and Intelligence ran and got third place. Fukuda then became friends with Mashiro and also competed with Ashirogi in the Golden Future cup with his original manga, Kiyoshi Knight. Fukuda then got serialized somewhat time after Ashirogi and is now an aspiring rival to Ashirogi, Eiji, and http://anidb.net/ch19967 [Nakai]. Among these three, he is considered to have the worst drawings, though they apparently match his stories. His drawings often border on grotesque. He can be extremely conceited and competitive at times, yet helps out his rivals, who are also his friends.\nSource: Wikipedia",
