Agon manages to be one of the 24 Hunter examinees to pass the 3rd Phase of the Hunter Exam, and make it to the 4th Phase on Zevil Island. During the 4th Phase of the Hunter Exam, Agon is hunted by Hisoka. When the two confront one another to attack, Gon uses his fishing pole to steal Hisoka`s number plate, catching the two by surprise. Agon dies almost immediately after the confrontation while collapsing to the ground from Hisoka`s card attack.Source: http://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Agon?so=search#1999",
