  "description" : "The mainstay of the Zentradi fleets for at least 500 millennia, the Thuverl-Salan Class Battleships remain the primary combat vessel of the Zentradi war machine. Built in the latter era of the Protoculture and used extensively during the Schism War, the Thuverl-Salan`s impressive design and functionality guaranteed a long service life. The ship features numerous beam and missile weapon emplacements all along the craft and the practical wedge-shaped hull enables the Thuverl-Salan to bring to bear the maximum number of guns possible against a target vessel at nearly any angle. In addition to firepower, the Thuverl-Salan also carries numerous Glaug mecha, Gnerl Fighter Pods and Re-Entry ships for transporting land-based mecha to the surface of a planet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/thurvel-salan.htm",
