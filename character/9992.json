Kaguya is Suzaku`s cousin, and met Lelouch and Nunnally during their childhood at the Kururugi Shrine. She is the representative of Sumeragi Concern, a large conglomerate founded by the Sumeragi House. Despite her age and physique, she possesses a strong will and is highly influential amongst the Houses. She is named after Kaguya, the main character of what is considered to be the oldest Japanese folktale.\nKaguya has admired Zero since his debut, and wishes to have his hand in marriage. She claims to be his wife in the second season, though she admits that they are only husband and wife in name. She doesn`t mind him dallying with other women; she claims \"a true hero enjoys physical pleasures,\" and proceeds to suggest that she, Kallen, and C.C. are Zero`s harem, noting their likeness to the Three Court Ladies.",
