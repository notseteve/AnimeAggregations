  "description" : "Narita is the more active boss in the editing department, much to the dismay of the chief editor, Tatsuhiko (though he doesn`t act offended but on occasion.) Narita is a man who knows when to be the boss and when to be the encouraging friend. While he is usually shown as being an amiable man who wants to help the other employees, he isn`t above yelling at the others to make sure they get their best work done and before deadline. It is never said explicitly one way or another where his sexual preference ultimately lies; but it is mentioned that Narita \"doesn`t like women.\"",
