  "description" : "Elekid is the baby form of Electabuzz, introduced in Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. Elekid stores electricity in its body by constantly rotating its arms, causing the space between its horns to flicker with a bluish-white electrical charge. It easily tires out, so it can only charge a little bit at a time if it accidentally touches metal and discharges its electricity. It is always happy when there is thunder rumbling, even in the most vicious of storms.",
