  "description" : "Tanabe Kozue is a gentle girl with a peaceful aura, who sometimes talks with Ika, hinting that invading might not be the best thing to do as not all humans are bad. It is implied that she also comes from the sea, as she has a hat similar to Ika`s and makes statements that indicate she isn`t human. The first syllables of her name spell out tako (たこ), meaning octopus.",
