  "description" : "There are four Houses, the animals of those houses being the fox, the wolf, the snake, and the cat (or panther in this case), called the Four Sacred Beast Houses. The wielders of the Sacred Beasts are very powerful and tend to be feared, which is why the Church chose to take them in; so that they could control them. The wielders also tend to be ostracized by their families, even being called disgraces for some reason, so they are usually alone except for each other. The members are chosen by the beasts before their birth, and protect them from then on. They all live together in a huge mansion.",
