  "description" : "Master Jingoro, the great wood doctor, lives near Hyakkoku City. He is known for his expertise in wood graphing and an article was written about him in a local paper managing to reattach a Mebukijika`s horn perfectly. Nurse Joy suggested to Serena that she visit him in order to get Serena`s Braixen`s twig fixed.\nInitially Jingoro insinuated to Serena that if her and Braizen`s feelings were strong enough, he`d be able to put 100 percent of his effort into fixing the twig and the way to show that was to have a Pokémon battle with him as he believes they are the best way to know a Pokémon`s feelings.\nAfter the battle, he revealed that by the time she had brought the stick to him, it was already beyond saving. He believed that Serena`s Braixen already knew the reason why he had her battle. he explained that it`s important to cherish tools, but as with anything, being too choicy about them is not a good thing. When Serena`s Braixen tried using Flamethrower with its broken stick, it turned into Fire Blast. It may have been coincidental, but it was Serena`s Braixen strong feelings that made Fire Blast launch from that broken stick. He finished off by saying that if it had feelings as strong as what he`d seen in the battle, he was certain that it could master any kind of tool.",
