  "description" : "The Solar Priestess Himeko is a very shy, innocent 16-year-old girl. She has known Chikane for many years not knowing Chikane`s affections towards her. At first, Himeko has affections for Souma Ougami, who is her childhood friend. When the two date, their relationship puts Chikane`s heart into turmoil. She starts off considering Chikane a very close friend although the two very rarely meet outside of secrecy. Himeko is an amateur photographer of some skill - a hobby she developed thanks to the support she receives from Chikane Himemiya. Himeko is initially a shy and timid girl, uncertain of her own worth and abilities. This is mainly because she was orphaned at an early age in an unknown manner. She was initially adopted by abusive relatives before being moved to other relatives. At school, Himeko seems to have only one friend, her dorm roommate Makoto. After the destruction of the dorms when Himeko comes to live with Chikane, she soon gains the enmity of Chikane`s female fans at school- a fact she does not deal with well. Despite her timidity, Himeko gradually starts to display great determination and courage. Himeko carries the solar symbol on her chest.",
