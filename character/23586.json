  "description" : "Masato is the younger sibling of http://anidb.net/ch23585 [Haruka]. He lives in Petalburg City with his family. He traveled with Satoshi, Takeshi and his sister Haruka throughout Houen and Kanto. He returned home after his sister went to Johto and Satoshi and Takeshi went to Sinnoh.\nMasato knows a lot about Pokemon even though he is quite young. He tries to learn as much about Pokemon as he can so that when he turns 10, he will be prepared to start his own journey to become a great Pokemon Trainer.\nSince Kasumi was no longer traveling with Takeshi and Satoshi, Masato took up the role of dragging Takeshi away from the girls by the ear.",
