  "description" : "Princess Yana is the shrine maiden of the shrine which recently had its local deity killed by the man that is only half a soul, Ao. She has two guardians, one female, Saki, and one male, Takanobu. Both have chosen themselves to be guardian, and have been reimbursed one was or another. Since Yana Hime knows them for so long, she sees them as her siblings and not just her guardians.\nShe carries the seal of Yana, the local deity, on her body since birth. Because of that she is not able to leave the shrine. The villagers call her the living god, as well as Yana`s bride. Yana Hime never knew her parents, nor the day she was born. When she dies, there will be another child born with the seal, and become a living vessel.",
