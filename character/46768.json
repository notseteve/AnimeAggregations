  "description" : "Noumi Seiji is a student at Umesato Junior High School and a member of the Kendo Club. He`s a Burst Linker with the ability to \"take\" any skill from other Burst Linkers. He takes Silver Crow wings. He was doublecrossed by Lime Bell who said she would \"join\" him and Silver Crow had his wings returned despite her \"betrayal\". He lost and was uninstalled with no memory of the AW, hence proving Kuroyukihime`s theory.\nSource: Wikipedia",
