  "description" : "Naota Nandaba is the main character. His name is derived from the Japanese word for \"honesty\". Unbeknownst to him, he has the \"right kind of head\" to be used as an N.O. channel.\nNaota is obsessed with appearing mature and attempts to act nonchalant. Naota idolizes his older brother Tasuku, carrying around Tasuku`s baseball bat, and even hanging out with Tasuku`s old girlfriend Mamimi. In Naota`s mind, Tasuku is the epitome of what it means to be an adult, that`s why he looks up to him (In fact, the name is a wordplay on \"Tasukete!\" - \"help!\" in Japanese), as opposed to the other adults in his life (e.g. his father, his grandfather, and his teacher) who he perceives as being immature.\nWhile at the beginning of the series Naota appears to be bothered by Haruko`s presence, over the course of the series he realizes his own feelings and admits that he loves her, along with embracing her with a kiss, in the final episode. His bass is the Rickenbacker 4001 which was Haruko`s, but she leaves it behind when she takes the new combination of his Gibson Flying V and Atomsk`s Gibson EB-0.",
