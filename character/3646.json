  "description" : "Yukari is one of the first year students at the school who lives in the same dormitory building as Mizuho and Mariya, who also is her Oneesama; it is a tradition for the underclassmen to serve their respective senpai any way they can. Much like Kana and Mariya, she is a very energetic girl, although unlike them, she is deathly afraid of ghost stories and anything scary - a fact which Mariya has often used for her own amusement and which initially caused some trouble when Yukari met Ichiko.",
