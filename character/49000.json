  "description" : "The VEFR-1 initially fulfilled the role of electronic warfare Valkyrie early in Space War One. Featuring a two-seater cockpit configuration, the VEFR-1 includes additional electronic hardware for use in reconnaissance missions as well as ECM/ECCM roles (Electronic Countermeasures/Electronic Counter-Countermeasures). Like most such dedicated craft, the VEFR-1 has no weaponry and functions strictly as a support unit, though the variable transformation is kept intact to increase battlefield deployment versatility.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/vefr-1.htm",
