  "description" : "Majic Lin is Orphen`s apprentice, and the second-male lead. He is a friend of Cleao`s, but not a close one since she`s three years older than him and she also spent a long time at boarding school. He deals with the torment from both Cleao and Orphen on their journey together to save Azalie. His father is paying Orphen to teach him, which at first seems a waste of money to his father. When Orphen repairs a glass that fell with his magic, before the father`s eyes, the father`s opinion about his money being \"thrown out the window\" disappears. Majic appears to be a good student, learning as much as he can, and retaining all of what he learns. Orphen seems to have a lot of faith in him. This gives him courage, which makes his power stronger. Majic looks up to Orphen, and refers to him as \"master\" upon Orphen`s request. All sorcerers call their \"teachers\", who teach them sorcery, \"master.\"",
