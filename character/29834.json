  "description" : "A naive young cadet trained at the Titans` private Newtype Lab, and assigned to Jerid Messa`s supervision for her first tour of combat duty. Despite her inexperience, Sarah is clever and resourceful. Her talents earn her the attention of the scheming Scirocco, and she soon becomes a devoted minion of her \"Master Paptimus.\" Nonetheless, this young Newtype has a good heart and a troubled conscience, raising the hope that the entreaties of our heroes may yet overcome the evil influence of Scirocco`s charms.\nSource: Official Site",
