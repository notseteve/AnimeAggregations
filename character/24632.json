  "description" : "Sumeragi Subaru is an onmyouji and the 13th Head of the Sumeragi clan, twin brother to Sumeragi Hokuto. He was trained from childhood to become the new head. He always wears gloves, having been ordered by his predecessor, his grandmother, to wear them constantly and to never show anyone his hands. His adventures as the most powerful onmyouji in Japan are told in Tokyo Babylon.\nIn X, he is recognized as one of the Dragons of Heaven, however he is unconcerned in the fate of humanity, seeking only to settle the score with Seishirou. He uses his abilities first to help Kamui awaken from his catatonia after watching Fuuma kill Kotori, and then makes a final confrontation with Seishirou, who is a Dragon of Earth.\nHe also appears in Tsubasa Chronicle, as one of a pair of twin vampires (the other being Kamui) for whom Sakurazaka Seishirou is searching.",
