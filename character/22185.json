  "description" : "A flying mobile suit developed for ZAFT`s invasion of Earth. The DINN is capable of independent flight in Earth`s atmosphere, allowing it to carry out aerial attacks or provide air support for ZAFT`s ground forces. These machines are also stationed aboard Vosgulov-class submarine carriers, providing ZAFT`s naval vessels with substantial air power as well. Similar in design to the high-performance command mobile suit CGUE, which was created by the same designers, the DINN is equipped with variable-geometry wings and a variety of anti-air and anti-ground weapons.",
