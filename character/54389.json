  "description" : "Naotsugu is Shiroe`s best friend and was also a member of the now disbanded Debauchery Tea Party group. His real name is Hasegawa Naotsugu. His main class is \"Guardian\", allowing him to use heavy armor and weapons along powerful defense spells to protect him and his companions. He calls himself an \"open pervert\", claiming that unlike some men he doesn`t hide his perverted nature from others and is very proud of that fact. He has a tendency to get on Akatsuki`s bad side with his perverted comments and a running gag is their confrontations usually ending with him getting a knee to the face, before she asks Shiroe for permission to do it.\nSource: Wiki",
