  "description" : "Nameless in the series. While he does have a name, no one seems to be interested in knowing it (including Hokuto himself), and they simply refer to him as \"you\", \"other guy\", or just \"Hokuto`s lackey\". There was actually a controversy among the students, when he said he did not want to be called \"Hokuto`s lackey\". Every time he tries to say his name though, something generally absurd happens and cuts the event short. In the manga, he helps Maeda come up with the nickname \"Dragon of Razors\", and Maeda suggests for Hokuto`s lackey the nickname \"The American Dream\". They are both satisfied with their new nicknames, but no one else acknowledges them.",
