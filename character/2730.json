  "description" : "Aureolus Izzard is an 18 year old alchemist and former Catholic Church magician who turned traitor. His sorcery name is Honos628, \"My honor is for the world\" (我が名誉は世界のために, Waga Meiyo wa Sekai no Tame ni). He possesses an ability called \"Ars Magna\", a skill produced by alchemy that turns his thoughts into reality through his words. This ability is heavily reliant on his belief and state of mind; the more he doubts, the weaker his spell becomes until it does not activate at all. Three years before the story began, he was Index`s former partner and was devastated when the young nun was forced to have her memories erased in order to save her life. In order to spare Index from repeatably losing her memories, he works with Aisa, using her powers to attract vampires to catch one and use them to turn Index into a vampire to overcome her life expectancy. When he learns that Index has already been saved, he angrily turns on everyone including Aisa, though Touma stops Aureolus by using his own powers against him and driving him mad. Out of pity, Stiyl changes Aureolus` appearance so that the Catholic Church is unable to capture and punish him.\nSource: Wikipedia",
