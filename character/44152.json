  "description" : "Tonkatsu (meaning \"pork cutlet\") is a piglet living in http://anidb.net/ch8588 [Suzu]`s house. His favorite food is cold tofu; he can only speak the words \"pu\" and \"puyo\" but communicates with written messages and even masters the multiplication able perfectly. Tonkatsu is shaped like a ball and has no legs, thus he moves like jumping like a ball instead and covers his eyes with his earlobes instead of hands when appropriate. His body is extremely flexible and can grow like a balloon when inhaling air. With his fine nose he excels in finding mushrooms, especially Matsutake.",
