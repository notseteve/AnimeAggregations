  "description" : "He was the first King`s Chair of the \"Guardians\" and their founder. Manages the planetarium as a part-time job. Artist of the artbook \"Kokoro no Tamago\" (The Heart`s Egg). Looks similar to Tadase. At first, he is thought to hold the Humpty Lock. A cat lover and has a liking for Ikuto`s cat ears. He plays as a minor character but seems to have a bigger role in the story, considering that it is he who assigns the Guardian Chairs and is often seen counseling Tadase.",
