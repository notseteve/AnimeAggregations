  "description" : "The Matori Matrix is an elite unit of Team Rocket Grunts headed by Matori and it`s second in command Gozu, first appearing in the Sun and Moon series.\nInitially, they were tasked trying to capture Necrozma, but failed. In their next appearance, trying to steal Stufful from the TRio, they got their ship destroyed by Bewear, as well as Gozu seemingly leaving the group.\nWhile the group originally had seven grunts not including Gozu, it got downsized to four in Journeys. The Matori Matrix Grunts` Purugly, Matori Matrix Grunts` Skuntank, and Matori Matrix Grunts` Toxicroak are references to Mars` Purugly, Jupiter`s Skuntank, and Saturn`s Toxicroak respectively.\nIn an alternate dimension, the Matori Matrix Grunts work under Meowth.",
