  "description" : "The Impulse Gundam is a prototype mobile suit created by ZAFT as part of its Second Stage series. The Second Stage machines use a number of new technologies to deal with the restrictions of the Junius Treaty that ended the previous war, such as a deuterion beam transmission system that allows them to receive an instant energy recharge from their mothership. Because the treaty places strict limits on the number of mobile suits each side can maintain, the Impulse is designed to adapt to a wide range of combat situations by exchanging Silhouette packs, and the mobile suit itself is made up of three separate modules that can be launched and replaced individually. The young ZAFT pilot Shinn Asuka uses the tactical flexibility of this unique machine to tremendous effect.",
