  "description" : "Feitan is one of the original members hailing from Meteor City and currently the de facto leader of the Phantom Troupe. He is attired in what one would expect from a bandit â€” dark clothes partnered with a skullhead scarf that covers his mouth. He seldom speaks, but when he does, it is full of grammatical errors, giving the impression that he is not speaking in his native tongue. During the Phantom Troupe`s fight with Chimera Ants, Feitan reverts to his native language, which was shown with Chinese characters. After Feitan`s victory over Zazan in Meteor City, he is crowned temporary leader of the Phantom Troupe. Feitan`s movements are incredibly fast, being able to leave afterimages of his body. He wields an umbrella that conceals both a sword and a gun that fires out of the tip.\nHis Nen ability is called \"Pain Packer: Unforgiven\" which transforms the injuries he has received from his enemy into an attack. The more pain he receives, the stronger his attack is. Currently, only \"Rising Sun: Burnt by the Sun\" has been revealed, a miniature sun that burns anyone around him disregarding even allies, as shown by the rest of the Phantom Troupe fleeing from the scene when he uses this ability. Only Feitan is unaffected by the attack, presumably because of the armor that is formed on him. Nen type: Transmutation\nSource: Wiki",
