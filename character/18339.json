A self proclaimed partner and advisor of Ryofu, and considers herself Ryofu`s protector, dishing out punishment to anyone doing anything she considers offensive to Ryofu (like she did to Kazuto when he bought Ryofu a bagful of nikuman in public, resulting in one of Ryofu`s attention-getting eating escapades).
