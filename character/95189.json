  "description" : "Professor Burnet was first seen in the anime on TV for the announcement that she had won the 15th Alola Lady Award which goes to the Alola region`s woman of the year. Although each year`s winner of the award is chosen among prominent women in a variety of fields, this was the first time it is awarded to an active scientist. The professor`s research prowess and friendly nature were both key factors to her receiving the award this year.\nProfessor Kukui called her unique and an excellent researcher. Her studies specialize in Ultra Holes. She created a device that can detect Ultra Aura but Faba is very jealous of her and pretended to say that the device was malfunctioning when they were investigating the high amounts of Ultra Aura at The Altar of the Sunne one night.",
