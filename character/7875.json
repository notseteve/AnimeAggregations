  "description" : "Greater Beast Zelas Metallium was created during the Shinma War, and is over 5000 years old. Though the Shinma War has ended, the overall conflict between shinzoku and mazoku has not. Shabranigdu at some point created five subordinates of his own: Hellmaster Fibrizo, Chaos Dragon Garv, Greater Beast Zelas Metallium, Dynast Grausherra, and Deep Sea Dolphin.\nThe most we have seen of the Greater Beast in the animated series so far are flashes of her legs and arms, and a momentary glimpse of her true form behind her servant, Xelloss in the openings of several seasons, but that does not mean nothing is known of her.\nZelas resides on Wolf Pack Island, the southern base of the former mazoku barrier, and is probably best known for her servant, Xelloss. Her wise investment rendered him the most powerful mazoku outside of Ruby Eye Shabranigdu`s five servants.\nHer true form is an armored wolf with wings. In the anime, we are given the impression that Zelas is an elegantly-dressed woman with long, silver hair who smokes.",
