  "description" : "A white demon dog that has served the Sumimura family since its founding; passed down to them by the founder Hazama Tokimori. Madarao is able to detect ayakashi with his amazing sense of smell, which he often brags is far better than Hakubi`s. However, no matter how fast he locates an ayakashi, Yoshimori could never dispatch them fast enough, a fact Madarao often bemoans. Madarao is around 500 years old, and prior to his existence as a demon, was a wolfdog known as Ginro (銀露), and was at one time friends with Kouya. He wears a \"collar\", made of spirit beads and seals strung together with a nenshi, that seals away his true demon form. When not assisting Yoshimori, he resides inside a special stone covered with glyphs, which is humorously located inside a wooden doghouse. When unsealed, Madarao become very large and uses powerful poisons and illusions. Madarao seems to have an unrequited crush on Hazama Tokimori; apparently, the reason he had followed him was because he fell in love with him on first sight. Throughout his service to the Sumimura Family, Madarao had refused to acknowledge anybody as his real master other than Hazama Tokimori, however, after the battle with Kouya, Madarao begins to view Yoshimori as his master.\n(Wikipedia)",
