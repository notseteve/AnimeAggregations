  "description" : "Suman Dark is an exorcist of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order]`s http://anidb.net/ch32499 [European Branch].\nHe joined the Black Order in order to pay for his daughter`s medical fees.\nIn fact, he had such a great love for his family that he begged http://anidb.net/ch7370 [Tyki Mikk] to spare him so he could live to see them again. However, in exchange, he had to give information about the Order, which turned him into a Fallen One.\nAs Suman did not want to be part of the Black Order in the first place, he was quite lonely during his employment, with the exception of making friends with http://anidb.net/ch32503 [Johnny Gill], whom he played chess with. Usually, Johnny wins, and Suman would refuse to talk with Johnny, and sulk all the time until after a mission, to which Suman would ask for a rematch.\nSuman has a Parasite-type anti-Akuma weapon, which takes the form of a gem-like stone near his thumb. He is able to manipulate the wind.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
