  "description" : "Armaldo was a Pokémon that lived in prehistoric times and became extinct soon afterwards, but it has been reincarnated through fossil-resurrection technology. Armaldo`s armor is very tough, making many attacks against it seem to bounce off. The frontal claws are freely extendable and contractible, and the Pokémon can wield enough propulsional force in its claws to punch through a slab of steel. Armaldo prefers land as its residence and the ocean as its hunting ground. The beetle-like back-wings are used for swimming underwater, and its claws are used to skewer its prey before feeding.",
