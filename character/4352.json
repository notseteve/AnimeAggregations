  "description" : "Sayuri fights with her wooden sword using the Hida Kasseiryuu. She is an old friend of Rein. Before she was invited to Miyagami Private Academy, she was referred to as a genius swordsman who inherited the pure blood of Hida. An incident that caused her to leave a senior swordsman permanently injured caused her to feel deep guilt ever since, and she sends him flowers daily. When Sayuri`s glasses are taken off, she has a hard time seeing, and ends up muttering \"glasses, glasses\" without ever being able to locate them. Sayuri is noted as having a particularly ample bust, something that her best friend Rein is often envious of.",
