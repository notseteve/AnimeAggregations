While Iris was at the Soryu Academy studying to become a Dragon Master, Martha realized that Iris was having a hard time fitting in with the students and studying at the school. Martha made Iris a meal that she was more comfortable eating which Iris found to be delicious and made her feel better. Martha could tell that Iris was so desperate to adapt to to the environment at the academy that she had no room for anything else and though that the food would cheer her up. Drayden, Elder and Martha all have high hopes for Iris and they hope that she will one day return to Soryu City to become the successor Gym Leader of the Soryu Gym.",
