Her chest is big, but her height and face resembles that of a middle schooler. Despite wishing to avoid conflict, she instinctively speaks up for the weak, wanting fair treatment even for those who have tried to hurt her. But when she met Mirei, her Liberator, she found she possessed the power to transform her body into a weapon. Her hobby is reading and she is worried being called by her surname \"処女 (Shojo/Virgin)\" (Half of it, she gave up).",
