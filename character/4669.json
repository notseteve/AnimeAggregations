  "description" : "Also known as Kitsune, meaning \"fox\" in Japanese, she is a 19-year old freelance writer (who never seems to write anything). She is frequently drunk and seems to enjoy teasing Keitarou at every opportunity. Kitsune is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 205. Her nickname is `Kit Fox`\nHer nickname comes from a combination of her first and last names, and the fact that she hardly ever fully opens both eyes at the same time (mostly when she is surprised). As a result, she has a perpetually fox-like, vulpine expression. She`s a practical joker and troublemaker; her mission in life seems to be to ensure that things never get too dull or those around her too complacent.",
