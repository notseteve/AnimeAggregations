  "description" : "Astraea has been described as having greater battle capabilities than Ikaros, and possesses two equipments: the super-oscillating photon blade `Chrysaor`, and a shield said to surpass the defensive power of Ikaros` `Aegis`, `Aegis L`. However, unlike `Aegis`, `Aegis L` is unable to cover every angle possible, only being able to block certain directions at a time, and it covers about half the area of `Aegis` in terms of angles. Astraea`s weak point is that she was made entirely for close-combat, and thus is extremely disadvantaged against opponents with long-range weapons or attacks, as she has no ranged attacks whatsoever.\nShe is sent by Synapse to dispose of Tomoki after he violates one of their rules.\nHowever, when she is ordered to eliminate Nymph, she breaks off her chain and betrays Synapse, engaging in combat with Chaos.
