  "description" : "Zeed is one of Baelgard`s four guardians. He is also an immortal due to a contract with his demon sword. He is in fact Philias` late prince, Leon, now under the control of his demon sword. His soul blade is called Holy Armor Sword Balmunc (聖鎧剣 バルムンク, Seigaiken Barumunku), and the sword and armor are similar to the ones used by Leon. He was later defeated by Souma, resulting in Leon`s spirit becoming free from the demon sword`s control.\nSource: Wikipedia",
