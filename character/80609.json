Even though Vanilla`s mother is a queen, she kept a careful eye on the Queen Candidate and the Queen Candidacy so that the ogres could not interfere again. In the anime, she loses the Queen Candidacy, but after the sacrifice made by Cinnamon for the Magical World, the throne was given to her after replacing Cinnamon`s place. In the manga, she sacrifices herself at the end to help Chocolat defeat Glac√©, acknowledging Chocolat as the Magical World`s Queen.",
