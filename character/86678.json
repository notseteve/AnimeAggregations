  "description" : "Yungoos is a Normal-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Gumshoos when leveled up in the day starting at level 20.\nYungoos is a long-bodied Pokémon similar to a mongoose. It is covered in brown fur with a yellow stripe down its back and underside. It has short, rounded ears on the sides of its head, a short snout with a pink nose, and a large mouth full of pointed teeth. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Yungoos is thick bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\nYungoos has a voracious appetite and always hungry. Much of its body is dominated by its stomach, and it is able to digest food quickly. Its strong teeth allow it to crush and consume the hardest of objects. This Pokémon stalks through its territory searching for food until it passes out from exhaustion. However, it is believed that Yungoos decides its territory based on safety so that it can collapse anywhere without fear. This Pokémon was introduced to the Alola region in an effort to control the Rattata population.",
