  "description" : "This good-natured AEUG officer serves as the Argama`s first captain, and his even temper and jovial demeanor give the rebel flagship a more relaxed atmosphere than under Bright Noa`s command. Along with Blex Forer, Quattro Bajeena, and the junior officer Reccoa Londe, Henken forms part of the AEUG`s initial core leadership. After Bright takes charge of the Argama, Henken transfers to the battleship Radish, from which he continues his shy courtship of the frosty Emma Sheen.",
