  "description" : "George is an eccentric, handsome, and extremely charismatic student of Yazagaku who has extraordinary talent with a gift for fashion design, haute couture in particular. He considers himself bisexual, or as he says, \"an equal opportunity lover\"; he also makes constant reference to how good he is with knots, and offers to tie people up repeatedly. The lifestyle that he lives is top-notch; he lives in a loft apartment and drives a vintage Jaguar, but because his mother was merely a mistress, he rarely sees his father.",
