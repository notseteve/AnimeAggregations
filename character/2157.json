  "description" : "He is the leader of the Dragon Knight Squad and was the only member to remain on La`cryma. He had feelings for Kosagi, but his affections were not returned. Eventually, his body decayed to the point of using mechanical prosthetics and a face mask to cover his eye and later most of his head.\nPrior to the series, Kuina realised La`cryma was a lost cause and had decided to ally himself with Noein to enter Shangri`la. However, due to Haruka`s power increasing and Kuina`s own body disintergrating, Noein refused to fulfil his end of the bargain. Kuina`s obsession with reaching Shangri`la prompts him to take Haruka there and attempt to force Noein to honour their deal. However, his body is rejected by the timespace and he disintegrates. Kuina has not shown any spin weapons, though one may assume that, as a Dragon Knight, he possesses at least one.",
