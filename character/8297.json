  "description" : "A 16-year-old Shinigami and Tsuzuki`s current partner. He possesses strong empathy, which allows him to feel the emotions of others, read thoughts, see memories, and pick up imprints of clairvoyance off inanimate objects.\nHe came from a tradition-oriented family, and he was trained in traditional Japanese martial arts. His parents were afraid of his spiritual powers, which they considered unfit for their heir as well as something that could unfurl the familiar secret; so as a child he was often locked in a cellar when caught using his empathy.\nWhen he was 13 years old he went out under the sakura trees near his home and stumbled across Muraki in the process of murdering an unknown woman. In order to keep him from exposing the crime, Muraki raped Hisoka and cursed him to a slow death that gradually drained his life over three years. The curse is still visible in the form of red marks all over Hisoka`s body, which reappear during encounters with Muraki, particularly in dreams. It is implied that they will disappear with Muraki`s death. After Hisoka died, he became a shinigiami in order to discover the cause of his death since the doctor erased his memories of it.",
