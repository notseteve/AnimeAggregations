  "description" : "Bill Wilcox is introduced in the series as a bounty hunter on the trail of Vanquo, an Outrider spy. He holds an almost infallible accuracy with firearms and serves as the gunner of Bismarck, controlling the six-iron while Shinji controls the chest cannons. His character is depicted as somewhat of a loner, but also as an outrageous flirt, making passes (mostly unsuccessful) at nearly every woman he meets. His parents were attacked and presumably killed by attacking Outriders right after he left to join a traveling rodeo. This event prompted him to become a bounty hunter.\nFor personal transportation and solo battles he uses a blue and white one-man spaceship named Bronco Buster.",
