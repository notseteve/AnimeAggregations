  "description" : "Meena was a servant in Prince Soma`s household that he looked up to, who was always there for him when his parents couldn`t be. An Englishman (revealed to be Lord West) wanted her for his wife, and she left India with him. In his search for her, Prince Soma goes to England, where Lord West coerces Agni into making curry for him in a contest so that he would win (as Agni is known as the \"Right Hand of God\" for his skill at making curry). In exchange, Lord West would have Meena act like her old self in front of the prince because Agni did not want the prince to know of Meena`s true colors. It is is revealed she left because she wanted to escape India, not because she was forced to as Prince Soma had thought. She had grown tired of taking care of Prince Soma and didn`t want to spend her life as a servant just because of her caste.",
