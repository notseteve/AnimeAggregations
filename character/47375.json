  "description" : "Riki is the male protagonist of Little Busters! and is the role the player assumes in the game. He is the fifth member of the Little Busters, and of them, he is seen as the weakest due to his girlish appearance and physical build, but he is the only one that is straightforward and has common sense among them. His parents died when he was very young, and around the same time he was diagnosed with narcolepsy.\nSource: Wikipedia",
