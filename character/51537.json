  "description" : "Gabriel is the dog of which Batou takes care. He is Basset Hound breed.\nThe dog Gabriel, looking one more time like the only real being, makes a key appearance, like in many of Oshii`s movies.\nA scene of Batou feeding his dog is echoing Ash in Avalon (2001) and Oshii Mamoru in his real life, as the director himself admits: \"Batou is a reflection of my own thoughts and feelings. Innocence is a kind of autobiographical film in that way.\"\nHe also explained the reason why all his films feature a basset hound-his faithful companion in real life.\n\"This body you see before you is an empty shell. The dog represents my body. Humans can be free only if they free themselves from their body. When I am playing around with my dog, I forget that I am a human being and it`s only then that I feel free.\"\nSource: wiki",
