  "description" : "The Guren Mk-II is a Knightmare Frame model designed by Indian engineer Rakshata Chawla, manufactured by Japan, and built by the Kyoto House. It is radically different from its Britannian counterparts, and its technology is on par with most seventh generation Knightmare Frames, a fact that is a source of pride for its manufacturers. The later Gekka models were based on the Guren`s technology. Unlike Britannian made Knightmare cockpits, the Guren Mk-II features an unconventional pilot seat shaped in the form of a motorbike seat, and a helm-like outgrowth surrounding its retractable head.\nThe Guren Mk-II`s main weapon is its silver right hand. The hand stands out from the otherwise red-painted mech, terminating in clawed fingers, and it can extend at the elbow for a surprise attack. Stored within the palm is the Fukushahadou, a powerful microwave radiation emitter. By grabbing onto an enemy Knightmare and activating the emitter, the Guren Mk-II can fry the enemy`s electronics and warp the frame itself, not only rendering the unfortunate machine completely unsalvageable, but often damaging the pilot`s ejection system, usually ensuring that the pilot will perish with his craft. While not designed as such, the Fukushahadou can also function as a shield. It has been shown to block the lances of enemy Knightmares, bullets from Knightmare rifles, and a shell from the Lancelot`s VARIS rifle, though the latter damages the arm on the first attempt. The arm is destroyed in the battle of Tokyo, but is replaced with a slimmer, three-fingered version in the second.",
