  "description" : "The Auto Memories Doll Traning School is a preparatory school located in Leiden, for women who want to work as Auto Memories Doll. This serves as some sort of a school which lasts for a couple of weeks, as the students get to polish their skills as a Doll, receives grades and gets to graduate if deemed worthy. The instructor of the school is http://anidb.net/ch95271 [Rhodanthe].\nAfter the war, the demand for Dolls grew rapidly and the writing industry became larger. It is possible to become a Doll without attending the school, but the objective of the school if not just to train any kind of Doll; it is to train the people to become the best Doll one can be. Graduating from the school is a proof of someone who is worthy of the Auto Memories Doll title, and if one manages to graduate, they will also receive a brooch in a proof of excellence. However, it is a strict school with high standards, so if the instructor does not deem someone worthy, they will not be given the certification.\nSource: Violet Evergarden Wiki",
