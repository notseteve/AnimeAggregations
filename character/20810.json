  "description" : "Yamada is a fellow classmate of Wataru that he meets on the ferry boat ride to Promised Island. He quickly becomes friends with Wataru, so as to hopefully get himself a girlfriend. Any opportunity he has to impress or help Wataru`s sisters he uses to his advantage, as he`ll do anything to get their attention.\nAlthough a bit of an odd character, he definitely provides the comic relief factor to the series. One of his hobbies includes Garban (a parody on Gundam) with collecting model kits and watching the TV series when he`s not trying to hit on Wataru`s sisters.",
