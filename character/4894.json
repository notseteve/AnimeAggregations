  "description" : "Also known as Number 7, is a young Silpelit girl who has the physical appearance of being 12-14 years old. Nana sees Kurama as her father, whom she calls \"Papa,\" because she needed something to keep her from going insane during the torturous experimentation, believing that she is making him proud. Kurama in turn sees her as his daughter and cares very much for her. In an attempt to recapture Lucy, Kurama sent out Nana to find her (diclonii can telepathically sense each other), then retreat until Kurama could arrive with soldiers, but Nana wanted to impress Kurama so she tried to capture Lucy herself.",
