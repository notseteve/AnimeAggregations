  "description" : "The Hundred Families (百家 hyakke) are magic families which, like the Ten Master Clans, possess numbers on their names. Talented Magicians from prestigious families are the true representation of this title.\nJust as the hundreds digit follows the tens digit, the same meaning applied in that they were \"families that were second only to the Ten Master Clans\". Thus all families bear a number larger than 11 in their name, signifying this.\nWhile the strongest of the strong became the Ten Master Clans, with the other 18 Assistant Houses as replacements, they are followed closely by the authentic \"Hundred Families\".",
