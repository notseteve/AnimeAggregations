  "description" : "A student from the prestigious Oak family, he often bullies Teito because he was a slave. During the final exam, Teito saves his life even though he has a grudge against him. Later, through connections with his father, he becomes a subordinate to Ayanami. Because Konatsu saved his life, he idolizes him greatly. He is very cowardly, conceited, and spoiled. He annoys the other Black Hawks so much that Hyuuga simply throws him out of the aircraft on a battlefield, claiming he was just sending him on the front lines. He is about to be killed before Konatsu saves him.",
