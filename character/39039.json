He won popularity thanks to his desire for colonial independence and his philosophy of absolute pacifism. His message gained so much support that OZ had Odin Lowe assassinate him on April 7, AC175. In the chaos following Yuy`s death, Alliance control on the colonies tightens and the designers of OZ`s Tallgeese, who later became the Gundam scientists, resigned in protest.",
