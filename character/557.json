  "description" : "Igglybuff resembles a small pink balloon. It has a round body with four tiny appendages. On top of its head there is a tuft, and on its forehead a counter-clockwise swirl. Like its evolutions Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff, Igglybuff`s body shares many properties with a balloon. It is very soft, elastic and flexible and somewhat feels and smells like a marshmallow. This enables it to bounce a long way, to the extent that Igglybuff finds it more efficient to move around by bouncing instead of walking on its two short legs.\nAlthough Igglybuff too has the notorious singing ability of its evolutionary chain, its vocal cords are not yet fully developed in this early stage of its life. A prolonged singing effort results in Igglybuff turning a deeper and deeper pink as it strains itself, finally ending up damaging its throat. Igglybuff tends to gargle with clear saltwater to soothe itself. Igglybuff is first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver as one of several of the pre-evolved Pokémon introduced in the game.",
