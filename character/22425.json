  "description" : "The father of Tarou.\nFive years ago, when Tarou was three years old, he took his family on a trip around the world. As they were flying a helicopter over the Safari Land, he held Tarou out of the window to give him a closer view at the Pokémon below, but ended up dropping him. Ever since, he and his wife had been searching for Tarou without luck, until someone sent them a photo of a boy resembling Tarou living with a herd of Kangaskhan in the Safari Land Pokémon reserve. Along with his wife, he traveled to the Safari Land to retrieve his son, and enlisted the help of the ranger Officer Jenny and Ash Ketchum. They soon discovered Tarou, but he had already forgotten his birth parents and lived as a part of the Kangaskhan herd. While Tarou eventually regained the memory if his parents, he was too connected to his adoptive Kangaskhan family to want to go home with them. Soon afterwards, Tarou, Ash Ketchum and the others were attacked by Team Rocket, who attempted to poach Kangaskhan using a giant Kangaskhan robot, and together with his wife, he sacrificed himself by running their helicopter straight into the robot, blowing it up and seemingly killing him and his wife. He survived the crash, however, and he and his wife eventually emerged from the wreck dressed in leopard skins, saying that since Tarou didn`t want to move away from his Kangaskhan family, they would live in the Safari Land with him from now on.",
