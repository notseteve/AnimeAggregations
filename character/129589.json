  "description" : "Professor Kukui`s Empoleon is one of the Pok√©mon Professor Kukui used during the Exhibition Match against Ash. Empoleon can swim as fast as a jet boat and the edges of its wings are sharp and can slice through an iceberg with ease. Empoleon swam the seas of the world, investigating ocean currents and it is like an Explosion of toughness.\nInitially it faced Pikachu in the Alola League Exhibition Match and Empoleon was completely unaffected by Electroweb. It caught Pikachu up in a Whirlpool causing it to get dizzy and Ash recalled it and replaced it with his Melmetal. Professor Kukui didn`t know much about it and Melmetal began to spin with all its might. The Double Iron Bash knocked out Empoleon quite quickly.",
