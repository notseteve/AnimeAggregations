She creates a body out of garbage for an unnamed entity only referred to as \"Me,\" so that she will not be alone in the illusionary world. This is Ushio after her death, who had lost her memories. In her edge of death after failing to get away from the illusionary world, Ushio, who had regained her memories, called the garbage doll (Tomoya) to collect the light orbs in order to save themselves for their doomed tragedy. In Clannad`s epilogue, she is shown sleeping under a tree where Akio begged for Nagisa`s life.",
