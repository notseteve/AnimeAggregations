  "description" : "Daichi`s little sister who always carries a camera with her. She`s in her first year of middle school but often gets mistaken for a grade schooler. She`s usually always cheerful, but has a curious habit of speaking in a very direct and spontaneous manner, not pulling any verbal punches.\nShe eventually joins Sora`s group of friends after they meet again while Sora is on a small drawing trip in the neighborhood, which culminates in Sora borrowing Minamo`s camera for a short while for sketching purposes, and then later draws a sketch of the then-sleeping Minamo. (With 30% cuteness added, at least according to Minamo herself.)\nSource: Myanimelist.net",
