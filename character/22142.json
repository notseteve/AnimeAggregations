  "description" : "The Calamity Gundam is one of three new Earth Alliance prototypes deployed in the invasion of the Orb Union. Based on an X100-series frame similar to that of the Buster Gundam, this new machine is likewise designed for long-range artillery attacks. However, with its improved Trans-Phase Armor and overwhelming firepower, the Calamity is far superior to its predecessor. In order to draw out its full potential this powerful mobile suit is assigned to Orga Sabnak, one of the artificially enhanced pilots the Alliance refers to as biological CPUs.",
