  "description" : "Akebono Ryou is a second-year university student taking up Science and the bassist of the band GYROAXIA.\nHe enjoys making other people happy since he claims that he was banished from his home planet for the crime of \"The inability to make people happy.\" So until he makes someone happy, he`ll choose to stay on this planet...or so he says. He has an overly laid back nature, and has a drawn-out way of speaking. Despite his odd nature, he`s a rare kind of geniusâ€”one able to join GYROAXIA without much of a sweat.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream! Wiki",
