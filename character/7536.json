  "description" : "Dita Liebely is the female protagonist who is romantically involved with Hibiki. She refers to him playfully as \"Mr. Alien\" (宇宙人さん Uchuujin-san), while Hibiki refers to her as \"that UFO Girl\". Dita has a bubbly, lively personality that usually shows in almost every aspect of life, even when she is fighting (she refers to the enemy as \"bad aliens\"). She admits to having feelings for Hibiki since she met him in the first episode (whether or not this was a love at first sight moment is debatable) and is subject to at least some ridicule and incredulity by her fellow crewmembers for her unusual infatuation with a male.\nShe mentions that it was always her childhood fantasy that \"Someday, aliens would come and take us in their spaceship to a land of happiness\", a variation of the \"Someday, my prince will come\" fantasy of women (which is impressive as Dita was raised in an all-female culture that saw males as a different species of hostile aliens).\nSource: Wikipedia",
