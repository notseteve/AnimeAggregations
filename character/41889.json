  "description" : "Fujioka Misaki is Misaki Mei`s cousin. She died from a kidney disease shortly before the anime begins.\nShe is actually Misaki Mei`s twin sister, Mei having been adopted by her aunt. Though they were raised separately, they occasionally met each other. She was the one Mei was visiting in the morgue when Kouichi first saw her. Misaki`s death is probably the first one which can be attributed to the calamity.",
