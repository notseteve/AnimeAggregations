  "description" : "Konaki Jijii is a comic, absent-minded old youkai man who attacks enemies by clinging to them and turning himself to stone, increasing his weight and mass immensely and pinning them down. He and Sunakake Babaa often work as a team. The original konaki jijii is a ghost which is said to appear in the woods of Tokushima Prefecture in the form of a crying infant. When it is picked up by some hapless traveller, it increases its weight until it crushes him.\nKonaki-jijii first appears in a cameo as one of many youkai attending a sukiyaki party in the story A Walk to Hell (Rental version) before making a more prominent appearance in The Great Youkai War (Shounen Magazine version).",
