  "description" : "The female protagonist of the series, she is an immortal and Yuta`s companion. She was raised by a group of old women who kept her captive and incapacitated in a hut. In reality, they were mermaids who sought to eat her once she reached adolescence and consumed human flesh in order to regain their youth. She travels with Yuta after he rescues her, and possesses a large sense of loyalty and feelings towards him, but due to her somewhat naive and spoiled nature, she does not seem to truly realize her emotions towards him may be love, or even simple affection (even where Yuta stated she might have been jealous, she does not understand what that word means, mistaking the pronunciation for jealousy and asks if it tastes good). She is fifteen when she gains immortality at the beginning of the series.",
