  "description" : "Shigure Ama is Asa`s mother and the first artificial life form created by the gods and devils. She has the habit of drastically reducing names to cute nicknames (Asa for instance is referred to as \"A-chan\") and for wearing a cat-ear hat(which is actually a cover for her demon ears). She looks abnormally young to be a mother, and it surprises the other characters to learn she is.",
