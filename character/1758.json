  "description" : "This is the first in a series of command mobile suits developed by the http://anidb.net/ch1738 [Crossbone Vanguard]. The Berga Dalas is larger and more powerful than the Den`an series, and six shelf nozzles are attached to its backpack for increased mobility. Its backpack also houses a beam flag emitter, which is used to guide the other pilots in the commander`s squadron. While most of the http://anidb.net/ch1738 [Crossbone Vanguard`s] squadron commanders use the newer Berga Giros, Dorel Ronah still pilots this earlier model into battle.",
