  "description" : "Millions Knives is one of the few fully sentient Plants and Vash`s twin brother. They are both born during a mission to further the human race and are taken care of by Rem until Knives disrupts the course of the ships, causing them to crash. This event was known as \"The Big Fall\". While Vash believes all beings have potential for good and deserve life, Knives believes in the survival of the fittest. In the manga, after discovering experiments performed on another sentient Plant, Tessla, and watching movies of human history, he decides that humans are evil and grotesque and that they need to be eradicated, though most of his hatred of humans comes from their misuse and murder of his own kind. Vash does not agree with his plans and seeks to stop him and show him that humans can progress, while Knives seeks to dissuade Vash from basing his life around the \"idealistic nonsense\" preached by Rem and to join his side.",
