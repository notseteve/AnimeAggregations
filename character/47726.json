  "description" : "Titaniva Mu Koshigaya (or Tita to her friends) is the captain of the Cha-Cha Maru, a petshop hunter ship she inherited from her father, Gentaro Koshigaya. A tomboy at heart, whenever she gets time away from the gas ocean, Tita often enjoys riding on her jetcycle. However, Tita would prefer to cruise the gas ocean. Although it is apparent her father is dead, Tita still believes that a part of Gentaro still lives or that he may be still alive.\nIn the manga version of Plastic Little, it is further known that Tita also has the ability to sense weather patterns at least a day ahead of time. She can even know if a storm is due just because of the air.\nSource: Wikipedia",
