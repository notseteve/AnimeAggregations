  "description" : "Grunbeld, also known as the Great Flame Dragon, is an apostle who serves together with http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], http://anidb.net/ch91880 [Locus], http://anidb.net/ch91878 [Irvine] and http://anidb.net/ch91872 [Rakshas] under the reborn http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith] in his Band of the Hawk. He is the leader of the Hawk` giants. Before he joined the Hawks, he became famous during the One Hundred Year War, holding a small northern country alone against 3,000 enemies.\nHis personality is quite unusual for an apostle. Different from most of the other characters, he is a man of pride, and talks more akin to an old warrior than a sadistic demon. He is a serious man who doesn`t like jokes and fooling around. He has also shown a very honorable side, which is rare for a high-ranking member of the reborn Band of the Hawk, and even rarer for an apostle. For example, at the Mansion of the Spirit Tree he questions the orders given to him, telling http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] that it isn`t honorable to attack an http://anidb.net/ch87815 [old woman] with so many troops.\nHowever, Grunbeld`s honor is debatable at best. Once he realizes how formidable Guts is while in battle against him, even facing the possibility of losing, he begins to use more craftier means of fighting and transforms into his apostle form. Guts eventually calls him out on his supposed \"ethics\", stating that monsters shouldn`t pretend to have such a thing as a warrior`s code or pride.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
