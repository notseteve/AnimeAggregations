  "description" : "Ash challenged Jasmine for the Mineral Badge and she sent her Steelix out after Pikachu defeated her Magnemite. Steelix was able to knock out Pikachu as it was tired from its previous battle. Jasmine`s Steelix was then defeated by Ash`s Cyndaquil as two proved to be a sufficient combo to defeat Steelix.\nWhile at Sunyshore City in the Sinnoh region, Jasmine met the Sinnoh Elite Four member Flint. She challenged him to a battle with her Steelix but Flint used his Infernape which had a significant type advantage as well as being his most powerful Pok√©mon. Jasmine`s Steelix was easily defeated by Flint`s Infernape.",
