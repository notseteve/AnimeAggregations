  "description" : "Chihiro is the protagonist of the story who has a zombie obsession/fetish. He uses an old manuscript to make a \"resurrection\" potion so that he can bring his dead cat back to life as a zombie. He goes at an abandoned building at night after his pet cat Baabu`s death. He performs his research of bringing the dead back to life in the old abandoned building; he sometimes see Rea going at the well near the building and shouting her problems about her lifestyle. He promised Rea that he`d take responsibility if she becomes a zombie. After Rea moved to his residence, he conducts research on preserving Rea`s body on a tent in his own room. He wants his first kiss to be given by a female zombie, which he experienced firsthand when Rea kissed him, due to lack of the herb used for the potion. He also experienced becoming a half-zombie, revealed after being stabbed by Dan`ichirou with a fencing sword. In the Anime this is due to Rea licking clean a wound that he acquires after she prevents him from being hit by a car (although the effects were only temporary). In the Manga she had bitten his lip when she `kissed` him. He also enjoys seeing Rea dressed as a Bunny Girl or a Nurse. Despite the fact that he`s not interested in living girls, he managed to fall in love with Rea when she was still alive, and confesses to her while Rea tries to devour him, whic h brings her to her senses. He tries to approach to her; however, he has difficulties given the incident and Rea`s own embarrassment.\nSource: Wikipedia",
