  "description" : "Narberal Gamma is one of the http://anidb.net/ch89828 [Pleiades], combat maids under http://anidb.net/ch72781 [Sebas Tian]. She`s a doppelganger and http://anidb.net/ch76797 [Momon]`s companion in their adventurers` guild, Darkness. She was chosen as one due to her most human-looking appearance out of all other maids. As an adventurer, she refers to herself as Nabe.\nLike most of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick] residents, she holds great disdain towards humans. This often proves troublesome, as she becomes incredibly violent when human males make advances on her.",
