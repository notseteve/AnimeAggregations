  "description" : "Anorith is known as the \"Old Shrimp Pok√©mon.\" Its many legs have reformed into \"wings\" along its side that enabled it to swim by undulating them in a fashion similar to a sting ray or trilobite. The forelimbs are claws which it uses to hunt prey. Anorith lived in warm seas millions of years ago. Anorith hunts its prey by stabbing it with its two front claws but, it might also paralyze the target with a blast of energy from its mouth. It bears similarities to Anomalocaris, a prehistoric organism.",
