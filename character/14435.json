  "description" : "Mao is a quarter-beast; she has a pair of cat-like ears. She is also the Princess of Bestia. She traveled to Souma`s world looking for Zero. In the process, she accidentally sent Souma and Kureha into her world. She previously saw Xion standing next to the dead bodies of Lazarus and Ryuna. Since Xion flew away before telling her that he has been possessed by Zeroboros, she was left there confused and in shock. This prompted her search for Zero, whom her country of Bestia had placed on the wanted list for murdering a priestess: Ryuna. Though she explains that this makes it easier for her to find him. She is also the true leader of Weissritter. Souma is able to draw a soul blade with fire properties from her, the Beast King Sword Lion King`s Flame Dance (獣王剣 獅子王炎舞, Juuouken Shishiou Enmu). Her particular soul blade becomes Souma`s preferred soul blade. Her feelings for Souma are revealed when she cries when Souma wants to leave, which moves him and he decides to stay with her in End Earth.\nSource: Wikipedia",
