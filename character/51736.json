  "description" : "The lovely Lila is a Humaritt, a man-made human being that is almost indistinguishable from the real thing, which was developed by the Shinba Industrial Corporation with the codename of ZZZ (Pronounced \"Triple Zet\"). After initially being abducted by the wayward wife of a millionaire, through mafia connections, Lila was eventually rescued by Najica before she had the misfortune of ending up as the mischievous Madame`s personal plaything. To Najica`s displeasure and dismay, the untested Lila is assigned to serve as Najica`s new partner on all future CRI intelligence operations.\nHaving little knowledge of the world around her, Lila is much like a newborn infant in that her lack of life experience tends to produce some aggravating situations for Najica to cope with. Lila`s saving grace is her skill in battle. It was Lila`s talent for carrying out secret missions that finally led to Najica accepting her as a capable partner and roommate, despite her unusual bathing habits.\nLila is quite adept at using as many weapons and vehicles as are required to finish her mission. From handguns to heavy machineguns, she can usually pick up anything found in the local environment and use it with amazing accuracy. However, her downfall in this area lies in strategy, as she is sometimes prone to being a little too direct in such matters.\nSource: Official Site",
