  "description" : "Adachi Emiri is part of the track team. She and other members of the team are initially forced to harass Ikki by Buccha`s team. After it disbands she and Yayoi become supporters of Kogarasumaru. She has a large crush on Kazu and tries to tend to him when possible. She eventually joins Kogarasumaru and acts as back-up, though her skills are unpolished. She has the strength and endurance of a man, much to the surprise of her opponents which she refers to as \"The Power of Love\".\nShe plays a crucial part in Kogarasumaru`s entry into the Gram Scale tournament, acting as the \"Panther\" in an A-class virtual reality battle against a simulated former Sleeping Forest team. It is her grasping of the coveted balloon that ends the game in Kogarasumaru`s favor.",
