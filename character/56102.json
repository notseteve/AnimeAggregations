  "description" : "Hachiken Shingo is Yuugo`s older brother who managed to enroll in the University of Tokyo, known as the most prestigious of Japan, but dropped out soon after, as he decided to run after his own dream, once he realised his father`s dream of having one of his sons accepted there. Aiming to be a great cook, he travels the country to perfect his cooking skills with questionable results, and usually drops by Yezo to pay a visit to his brother, despite Yuugo`s animosity towards him. During his travels, Shingo meets a Russian girl and ends up marrying her.\nSource: Wikipedia",
