  "description" : "Asahi Nayuta is a first-year university student taking up Law and is the vocalist of the band GYROAXIA.\nNayuta leads GYROAXIA due to his powerful vocals and overwhelming charisma. Sharp-tongued, abrasive, and aloof, he expects nothing from his band members other than the best. However, if they are not up to his expectations, he won`t hesitate to cut them off without warning. He shows no interests other than music, speaking in a rude, abrasive tone. However, he does see potential in Ren Nanahoshi as a fellow vocalist, wanting to face him head on once he`s at his best.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream! Wiki",
