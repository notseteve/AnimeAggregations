  "description" : "Saeki Nobuko is a spiritual fortune teller and has a praised fortune telling column in Housewives` Knowledge, although she dislikes the occult. Her spiritual sense is so strong that she is able to see the Guardian Characters. She is the one who inspires Amu to wish to be a new person, meaning that she ignited Amu`s wishes. She is also fond of Tadase, probably because he looks so much like Tsukasa, who is one of the astrologers in her magazine.",
