  "description" : "A member of the Seishuu baseball team, in the same year as Kou. Senda claims to be a lady`s man, and constantly pursues Aoba as well as other girls. He is the only non-recruit to pass Coach Daimon`s placement test, and is placed on the first-string team as a pitcher. Because of this, during his first semester he frequently brags about how good he must be. Coach Maeno comments that Senda is too much of a showoff to be a good pitcher but would be a good \"flashy shortstop\". After making too many errors as pitcher during the first scrimmage between the first-string and prefab teams, he is demoted to the prefab team, where Maeno substitutes him as shortstop. After Coach Daimon is fired, Senda becomes the starting shortstop and leadoff batter. In his third year of high school, he becomes impressed by Aoba`s hard work and begins taking practice more seriously.",
