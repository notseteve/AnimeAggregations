  "description" : "Raku is the son of a Yakuza family leader. He refuses to take over the family`s duties as the next leader, and prefers to pursue a normal career when he graduates. In the story, he is placed in a fake relationship with Chitoge to prevent a war from starting between their families. The relationship often leads to misunderstandings and difficulties for him as he pursues his crush, Kosaki Onodera. Raku is shown to be very kind and caring even to the people he is supposed to hate, as shown when he helps Chitoge numerous times in the series. As the story progresses, he grows closer to Chitoge, and he even stated that he no longer hates her, although he has yet to sort out his true feelings.\nSource: Wiki",
