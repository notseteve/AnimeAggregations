  "description" : "Erika is Tomo`s other best friend and a Lemon Angel. She has dark skin and white hair. Always sticks up for Tomo and Saya, and wants everyone to stop fighting with each other and just be friends. She came to live in Japan from Brazil with her adopted brother Takumi, who is a famous rock star from the band Third Sence. She was constantly picked on by her peers (except for her friends, of course) for being a foreigner and not knowing anything about Japanese culture, and was used in episode 5 by Haruka and the other unnamed characters to meet Takumi when it turned out he was unavailable to meet them. She is also a good cook.",
