  "description" : "A mute girl whom Heine saved from gangsters who intended to sell her into a life of prostitution. She has been genetically modified so that a small pair of feathered wings extend from her back. Notably, she is the only female Heine is comfortable around, and has not triggered a violent reaction through physical contact with him. It has been noted by several characters, that Nill is also the only one to calm Heine down just by mere presence. Due to her quiet nature and kindness, she has affected many of the characters into wanting to protect her and seek her for comfort, these include the Bishop, Naoto and Badou. She is often saved by Badou, while Heine and Naoto go on a killing rampage. It is shown that she can`t sew, but tries to do so to stitch Heine`s bullet-worn clothing. She and Naoto develop a sisterly bond, often spending time together.",
