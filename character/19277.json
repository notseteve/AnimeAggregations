  "description" : "Tsukasa Shuro is an Okinawan C-Genomer raised as a man by her family in fear that Shuro would one day take away the family`s heirloom hagoromo and ascend to heaven. She is GeSANG`s famous pop star alongside her cousin Tsukasa Kei, of whom she shares more than cousin feelings for. She dies near the end of the series attempting to free the C-Genomes. Shuro has the ability to magnify her voice to epic amplitudes when she transforms into a tennyo, to a degree that people near her had their hearts rupture. Mikage scientists identify Shuro as tennyo type Juno.",
