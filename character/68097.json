  "description" : "Minami is Diantha`s assistant. She organizes interviews and meetings and tries to keep her on schedule. She`s almost overprotective of Diantha and her attitude is quite stern and can get angry sometimes. Professor Sycamore seems to have encountered her before as he joked that she looks cute when she`s angry. When Rocket Gang stole Diantha`s Gardevoir, Minami showed up at the right time in a helicopter.",
