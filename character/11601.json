  "description" : "Another witch who fought Bernkastel in a \"game\" in the past. Her name and appearance hint at her being connected to Takano Miyo from Higurashi. \"Lambdadelta\" (λδ) represents thirty-four when using Greek numerals and \"Miyo\" (三四) can translated as \"three, four\" in Japanese. Despite that she is quite childish and holds a grudge against Bernkastel for finally beating her in their last game, she actually cares for her. She is also known as the Witch of the Absolute and The Most Powerful Witch in the Universe before losing to Bernkastel. She is the most powerful witch next to Bernkastel, and is feared by most other witches, including Beatrice. Her \"Magic of Certainty\" allows her to kill anyone without fail, as an absolute result. Like Bernkastel, she is a Voyager. She wants Battler and Beatrice to fight against each other for eternity.",
