He is always being assaulted by Tamayo and her various martial arts techniques, which he has been a victim of since he was four years old. He becomes jealous of Ohjirou`s advances towards Misaki, going so far as to try to attempt to play a quasi-match of Angelic Layer against Ohjirou, despite the fact that he had never played it before. His family owns a karate dojo and Kotarou has practiced karate some himself, showing Misaki some of his knowledge in hopes that Misaki can use it to help Hikaru win. In the manga, he and Misaki later fall in love and date.\nHe also resembles Hiromu Shinbo from Chobits.",
