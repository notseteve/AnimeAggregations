  "description" : "Inaho is an anime-only character, a representative of the Kameda family, which once contested the Nakajima family for the right to be the protector of the Inuzuka family. The Kameda family is associated with turtles, which do not appear in the Chinese zodiac. In order to gain ascendancy over the twelve families, Inaho studies law and gains a teacher`s license in a bid to get close to Koushi as his school teacher and marry himâ€”despite having a dislike for law and considering becoming a teacher a lot of hard work. Like Sanae Nakajima, she has an alter ego, hers named Kame Kamen (Turtle Mask), with an equally exposing outfit which features several large pieces of armor plating, like a turtle`s shell. She goes so far as to try and drive off Momoko and kidnap Koushi after drugging him because she could not seduce him, but in the end relinquishes her efforts in the face of Sanae`s dedication. She admits to having developed genuine feelings for Koushi. Unfortunately for her, he did not reciprocate, considering a relationship between a student and teacher to be unethical.\nInaho seems to be the first of a new initiative versus Koushi, since she is the first of several women who have sought him out to marry him and gain power over the twelve families, rather than assassinate him.",
