  "description" : "Katsura Hinagiku is the current http://anidb.net/ch16568 [student council] president, and kendo club president at http://anidb.net/ch16459 [Hakuou Academy], the school that http://anidb.net/ch528 [Nagi], http://anidb.net/ch531 [Isumi], and eventually http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate] attends. She is fifteen and is an expert with swords, specifically kendo. She first meets Hayate when he gets lost on the huge Hakuou campus and ends up rescuing her. She had been helping a baby bird who had fallen out of its nest, but due to her fear of heights, had become stuck without her realising it. Hayate ends up helping her down the tree, and then promises that he will come to help her should she ever call for him. In gratitude, she invites him to the top of the clocktower, where only student council elites are allowed. She allows Hayate to call her by her first name and also seems to be infatuated by Hayate and his attractive personality. Her family, while shown to be well off in volume 8 (chapter 76), does not show any signs of being rich in comparison to much of the cast.",
