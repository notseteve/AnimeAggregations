  "description" : "Caterpie known as the Worm Pokémon, are larval Pokémon found in the wild early in the Kanto and Johto regions. In main series Pokémon games set in these regions, Caterpie are among the earliest and easiest Pokémon species caught by players, as they are very weak. They can be evolved into their cocoon-like Metapod form and eventually into the butterfly-like Butterfree form. Caterpie in the wild employ biological adaptations to survive, much like real caterpillars, in that their green bodies are useful for camouflage in foliage, their eyes are patterned to scare away predators, their suction-cup feet allow them to climb any surface, and the osmeterium on their heads can project a horrid stench to repel predators. It bears a resemblance to the spicebush swallowtail caterpillar.\nIn the anime, Caterpie as the first Pokémon Ash ever caught in his trainer career, and it eventually evolved into a Butterfree and was later traded for a Raticate on the S.S. Saint Anne but is traded back later in the episode. Ash releases it later so it could mate with a pink Butterfree.",
