  "description" : "Ichinose Hanae is a short, middle-aged woman who is rarely seen sober. Her wage-slave husband seldom appears in the manga and is completely unknown to the other tenants until he gets temporarily laid off. She enjoys joining in with the other tenants to stir up trouble for Yuusaku and Kyouko, but she occasionally acts with good intentions for the two, especially Kyouko, whom she sees as a \"younger sister\" (willfully ignoring the difference in their ages, as the other tenants point out). However, even when she is acting with the best of intentions, her way of doing things often leave Yuusaku, Kyouko, or both in worse situations than if she had not gotten involved. Mrs. Ichinose is also an incurable gossip who relishes her room`s proximity to the communal telephone.\nShe lives with her husband and her son Kentarou in Room 1 (Ichi-no-se means \"first ford\").",
