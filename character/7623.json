  "description" : "Zaraki Kenpachi is the wild and bloodthirsty captain of soul society`s Eleventh Squad. He cares little for the politics of soul society or its fate, but is happy as long as he gets to fight. He is a tall muscular shinigami with an enormous amount of spiritual energy. Though he is a monster in battle and attacks his foe relentlessly, he often purposely holds back in fights in order to prolong his enjoyment. Kenpachi`s zanpakutou has no name and no apparent abilities; it is also incredibly worn and battered from its long battle history.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
