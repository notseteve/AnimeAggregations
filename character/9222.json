  "description" : "Though alluded to throughout the series, it is revealed that Nono is in fact a buster machine.\nNono herself is formidable, with the ability to warp almost instantaneously using the singularity built into her. Using three special lenses on the back of her hands and her chest, she can absorb energy blasts. Upon her legs are six banks of lasers similar to the ones used on the old Exelion, as well as additional thrusters. Finally, she can fire off a Buster Beam, or her rendition of a slicing maneuver, where she has the power to cut a moon in half. Not to mention the ability to create multitudes of micro-black holes. However, her greatest ability is to control what is referred to in this series as \"Space Monsters\", which are actually the Buster Corps support unit built to protect the solar system from the true Space Monsters. The greatest show of this is when the entirety of the collective Buster Corps patrolling and encircling the Solar System is assembled, creating the largest Buster Machine combination to date, \"Diebuster\". It`s a gigantic red-colored rendition of Nono, though the outfit bears a close resemblance to the legacy Top Squadron uniforms from Gunbuster. Assembled, it is comparable in size to Earth. In this form, Nono resides in the large crest upon the machine`s forehead, which resembles the insignia of the space fleet from Gunbuster.",
