  "description" : "Ugumori Etsuko is the wife of http://anidb.net/ch148707 [Souichi]. One day during a summer festival she mysteriously went missing while running behind a local shrine, making her husband believe that she was \"spirited away\".\nIn reality she was being abused by her mother-in-law for years while Souichi was always turning a blind eye. Having had enough she contemplated suicide but finally decided to run and leave her family behind. With the help of her friend from the school days, http://anidb.net/ch148710 [Yoshimi], she was able to make a living in Nagano, running a small traditional restaurant. Some years later by chance she heard the voice of her daughter, http://anidb.net/ch148711 [Ayano], who was being interviewed on the radio after she had won an amateur singing competition. Etsuko decided to contact her daughter who in turn wished to come see her in Nagano. Etsuko once again acquired the help of Yoshimi and her son, http://anidb.net/ch148706 [Kenzou], who used the same \"spirited away\" method to make Ayano disappear. Because by this point her mother-in-law had already passed away Etsuko was able to return to Ugumori family`s estate finally reuniting with Souichi.",
