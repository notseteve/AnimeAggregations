  "description" : "Fuji Shuusuke is a third year student at Seishun Academy. He is given the title \"tensai\", or genius, due to his tactical skill on the tennis court. He is in the same class as Kikumaru Eiji, and is Eiji`s good friend. Fuji is a leap year baby (his birthday is on February 29), and thus he can only properly celebrate his birthday once every four years. Fuji is cheerful and easygoing, with a penchant for playfully teasing those around him.",
