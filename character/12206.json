  "description" : "Village Hidden in Hot Water (Yugakure no Sato) is the village that the http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki] member http://anidb.net/ch7740 [Hidan] originated from. Once a ninja village, Yugakure decided that it didn`t feel like staying a hidden village and transitioned out into a peaceful and prosperous village instead. However, Hidan, growing up, already showed a tendency toward violent Jashinist ways, decided that he didn`t like this and slaughtered his neighbors before leaving the village.\nYugakure makes an appearance in the series in Shippuuden episode 92. When http://anidb.net/ch8607 [Yakushi Kabuto] and Yuukimaru are on a journey they stop here to rest. http://anidb.net/ch7714 [Yukimaru] meets http://anidb.net/ch226 [Uzumaki Naruto] in a hot spring and talks with him about how hearts can communicate. There wasn`t much seen from the village in the episode, but it seemed small and had no protective walls, like other ninja villages had.",
