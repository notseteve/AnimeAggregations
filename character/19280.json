  "description" : "Wei Fei Lee is a young, skilled martial artist from China hired by Mikage International. Wielding a vicious chain whip and various tiny throwing blades, he is often sent out to bring in captured C-Genomers or other covert tasks. When Tooya tried to leave the headquarters together with Aki he was sent stop them. His left eye was taken by Tooya during their fight. He is Aki`s (and Shiso`s) caretaker and bodyguard, as Tooya`s replacement. He seems to be calm most of the time and does not complain, but harbors a grudge against Tooya for the injury he caused.",
