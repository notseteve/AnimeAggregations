  "description" : "Ueshige Suzu is a second year at Himematsu High, plays vanguard position. Kyouko recommended her on the team because of her ability to win explosively albeit rarely. Can do well if the game is all simples. If she fails at a task given to her by Kyouko, as punishment, Kyouko will write something on her forehead. Kyouko says she usually wins explosively the stronger her opponent gets, although sometimes she misfires.\nSource: Wiki",
