  "description" : "At 16 years old, handsome, with good looks and a good fashion sense, the only thing Ikumi lacks is money. Although from Jupiter, an area associated with wealth and prestige, Ikumi claims to be poor and thus remained on the Liebe Delta for the Dive Break despite his friend Kouji`s expectations that Ikumi would go home. Ikumi is an excellent piloting student and out of the entire Level 2 class, ranked second in the piloting exams (Kouji`s brother Yuki took first place). Charismatic, Ikumi is the `leader` of Kouji`s circle of friends, and has taken notice of Kozue Izumi, his would-be girlfriend. He is Kouji`s roommate, both aboard the Liebe Delta and the Ryvius, and the two are good friends. Ikumi is also the main operator for the Vital Guarder, coordinating the other four.",
