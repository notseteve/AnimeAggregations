  "description" : "Exeggcute is a single Pokémon with six separate seed bodies (often mistaken for eggs, according to the Pokemon episode, \"March of the Exeggutor Squad\"). Exeggcute`s name is a play on the phrase \"eggs are cute.\" It is also a play on the word execute. Tamatama could be taken to mean 偶々, unexpectedly, although it is more likely to be derived from 玉 tama, sphere, doubled. It is worth noting that the Japanese word for egg is 卵 tamago. They use telepathic signals only they can receive to remain in their balanced formation; even if one is separated, it will quickly rejoin its swarm. Each member of the swarm have a different appearance in number of cracks, deformations, personalities and expression. Some Exeggcute can have such severe cracking and breakage that a Yolk can be seen inside. The middle body often has the fewest or no cracks at all, and is assumed to be the boss of the group.",
