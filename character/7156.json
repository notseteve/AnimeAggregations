  "description" : "Kept asleep in a liquid chamber at Fei Wong Reed`s palace, with his left eye covered by an eyepatch, his hands and arms by binding spells and wearing clothes marking Fei Wong Reed`s bat symbol. In fact, this Shaoran is the original while the Shaoran at Sakura`s side is only a clone that Fei Wong Reed created. This Shaoran is of Clow Reed`s bloodline, the son of Sakura and Shaoran from another dimension (from CCS), and can thus use magic.\nHe gave his eye and with it half of his heart to his clone to stop Fei Wong`s plan temporarily, hoping that this action could create a true heart in the clone. Because he had given his eye Shaoran was able to witness all the events the clone did. He was depicted as a villain (it was believed that he was controlling the clone`s actions, while it was only the clone`s true nature showing) until it was discovered that the protagonist Shaoran is his clone. Now the real Shaoran is the story`s protagonist. This Shaoran is able to summon a sword, the same one used by his father and he also uses the same spells.",
