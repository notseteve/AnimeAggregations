  "description" : "Tainyan and Sainyan are twin sisters from the China-based country of Shai-Fang, an isolated region of the Continent surrounded by steep and cloudy mountains. They are the descendants of a lineage of exorcists that has been carrying the responsibility of protecting the village for generations, and are bound by an unbreakable cord called the Ryu-Rin-Ren which is wrapped around their necks. They left for a journey in the outside world to bring back the Goshintai, (lit. \"Sacred Body of God\"), a mysterious divine protection that has once made Shai-Fang a warm and peaceful land. It is later revealed that this \"Goshintai\" is actually a human, a girl called the \"Child of the Dragon\", considered a being with god-like powers in Shai-Fang.\nSainyan, the younger sister and more taciturn of the two (she only whispers to her sister`s ear), can use arts with a mysterious power similar to magic, but is often seen spacing out and is very weak, so she`s not very useful in battle.\nSource: Wiki",
