  "description" : "Haruhi Fujioka is the main character of the series. She is an intelligent but poor first-year student attending exclusive Ouran High School on a special scholarship that requires her rank first in her class. One day, while looking for a quiet place to study, she stumbles upon the Ouran Host Club and accidentally breaks an expensive vase belonging to the famed Host Club and must work off her debt as a host for them; to do this, she must disguise herself as a boy, which she finds easy to do because she does not feel that her gender dominates her personality. She soon realizes she enjoys acting as a host to other girls, which she takes to naturally, though she does not like taking time away from studying and finds the antics of the other hosts extremely irritating. Although habitually quiet and unflappable, she has a deep fear of thunderstorms. Haruhi lives with her okama (crossdressing) father and has become skilled in household chores due to her mother`s death when she was 6. Although her independent, straight-forward personality clashes with those of the other, more outgoing hosts, Haruhi becomes friends with them, especially the Hitachiin twins, who are in her class, a fact that is exceedingly troublesome to the Host Club King, Tamaki.",
