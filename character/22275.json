  "description" : "The Abyss Gundam is a prototype mobile suit developed by ZAFT as part of its new Second Stage series. Its mobile suit form has tremendous firepower thanks to its arsenal of beam weapons and shell-firing cannons, and it carries a lance equipped with both a beam blade and a physical blade, enabling this weapon to be used even underwater. It can also change into a mobile armor form for underwater combat, although in this form it relies mainly on its guided torpedo launchers. After the Abyss Gundam is captured during the attack on Armory One, it is assigned to Auel Neider of the Phantom Pain special forces unit.",
