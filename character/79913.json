  "description" : "Hishiro Chizuru is a very smart but socially awkward classmate of http://anidb.net/ch79914 [Arata]. She usually scores the top grades in her year, which makes her the class representative and has all her school expenses paid for as a result. She is not only socially awkward, but also fairly ignorant with regards to anything not directly related to school matters, particularly social and emotional ones. She`s always doing research online on whatever she doesn`t understand.\nSource: Wikipedia",
