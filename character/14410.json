  "description" : "Ruby is Meimi`s cute, brown pet hedgehog. She is introduced early on in the anime series. She was bought by a man, then Meimi stole her to protect the gem that the man made her swallow. Ruby knows Meimi is Saint Tail, and has been on a caper with her, inspiring a \"hedgehog magic spell.\"\nRuby wears a black ribbon similar to Saint Tail`s, and speaks by saying \"Kyuu.\" Meimi has to keep Ruby hidden from Asuka Jr. so he won`t recognize her from a previous caper.",
