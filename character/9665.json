  "description" : "Ichise lost his parents in early childhood and, not having any relatives, was left all alone in the world. Coming from the wrong side of the tracks, life has been tough for him. He`s been forced to survive only on his own devices without anyone to open up to. The only thing which the generally reticent and expressionless Ichise shows a strong sense of attachment to, is the capsule containing his dead mother`s body cells. Under the cold mask, he may be desperately longing for family affection. Ichise lives hand-to-mouth as a boxer in \"fight-to-the-death\" betting matches called \"games\". However, he was punished by a violent group of men for crossing the game promoter`s mistress and loses an arm, his only means of survival, along with everything else.",
