  "description" : "Winry Rockbell is a close childhood friend of http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] Elric since their young life in Resembool, she is almost like a sister to the two and essentially their only family. An amateur surgeon and mechanical repair specialist/enthusiast, Winry acts as Edward`s rear line support as his personal automail engineer and mechanic, making sure his prosthetic right arm and left leg are always in good working order. Additionally, she provides a great deal of emotional support for the pair and somewhat plays the role of the love interest in the story.",
