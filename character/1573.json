  "description" : "She is a good friend of Mawari and a meganekko. While her true name is unknown, her classmates only refer her as the Class President. Despite the fact that she is the class president, her presence is usually too passive to be noticeable. She later reveals that she has very strong feelings for Nagasumi. Later, she writes a love letter to Nagasumi, to confess her love, but accidentally confesses to Sun due to not looking at the person she was confessing to. This event leads to the sudden creation of an alternate persona, the \"Last Amazoness\", a girl-loving warrior who declares her intent to have Sun as her own. The Class President uses this persona when she`s trying to get noticed or when she needs extra confidence. In recent volumes of the manga, the Last Amazoness takes an active role in fighting troublemakers after receiving a gender-reversing mermaid weapon, \"Gender-X\", from Surtan. The Class President also works with Maki on occasion, believing her to be a fairy. (wikipedia)",
