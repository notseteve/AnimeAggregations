  "description" : "Land dragons are dangerous reptilian creatures that inhabit Gaia. They have blue blood and move with their powerful forelimbs as their hind limbs are ridiculously atrophied. Their lungs allow them to breathe fire and, although they have no wings, a membrane connecting their forelimbs with their body allows them to jump and glide. Their tails have a sharp plate scale that can pierce and tear bodies.\nThey are particularly present around Fanelia, known as the Kingdom of dragons. They have a great importance in the mythology and rituals of the people of Fanelia but are also hunted by other peoples in order to exploit the drag energist (kind of power cell) contained in their hearts.\nThese dragenergists serve as a versatile magical energy source, powering mechas, but also ships and flying fortresses.",
