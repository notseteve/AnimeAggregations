  "description" : "Kuchiki Byakuya is the 28th head of the noble Kuchiki clan, one of the four great noble families in Soul Society. As such, Byakuya acts in an aristocratic manner â€” he seems always serene and apathetic towards other people, even when he is actually deeply conflicted. He is also extremely calm, even in battle, and is very seldom surprised by even the most drastic of actions. Ironically, when he was younger, he was quick to anger and very hotheaded, as noted by his grandfather, http://anidb.net/ch9327 [Kuchiki Ginrei]; similar to the the way http://anidb.net/ch2069 [Ichigo] and http://anidb.net/ch8722 [Renji] are now.\nByakuya strongly believes in law and order. As the head of one of the great noble families and as a captain in the http://anidb.net/ch9291 [Gotei 13], he always works hard for a peaceful society. He thinks that if someone in his position doesn`t follow the rules as a good example, then no one will follow them. He believes that to maintain the order, all law-breakers must be punished, even if that goes against his own wishes. Despite his icy and regal manner, Byakuya cares for and protects those important to him, even referring to http://anidb.net/ch3720 [Rukia] as his \"pride\".\n[Source: wiki]",
