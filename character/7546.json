  "description" : "Fudou of the Mountains is a giant warrior who uses his huge size and brute strength to crush his enemies. Fudou was once a ruthless bandit known as Fudou the Ogre, whose presence terrified a young Raou when he invaded the Hokuto Shinken dojo at one point. However, a young Yuria stood up to Fudou`s rampage and taught him the value of life. Fudou became a gentle giant, and later began raising several orphaned children as a foster father. Fudoh befriends Kenshirou and his companions in order to lead them to the Nanto Capital, and eventually reveals the Last General`s true identity to Ken.\nRaou later challenges Fudou in order to overcome his fear against Ken. Despite heavy injuries during the fight, Fudou manages to make Raou take a retreat slightly, causing Raoh`s men to impale Fudoh with several large lances and arrows, mortally wounding him.",
