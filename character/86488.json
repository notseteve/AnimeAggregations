  "description" : "Alain`s Tyranitar was revealed in the final round of the Kalos League. It was the first match up of the battle and it faced Pikachu. The match began with the creation of a Sandstorm caused by Tyranitar`s Ability, Sand Stream. Alain though the Standstorm would be an effective way to restrict Pikachu`s field of vision as well as its movements. Pikachu managed to wipe out the Sandstorm though by kicking up a lot of water from the stream in the battlefield. In addition, Tyranitar got drenched and the Thunderbolt used right after did significant damage. The match was concluded when Pikachu defended Crunch with its Iron Tail and then quickly followed up with an Electro Ball to knock out Tyranitar.",
