  "description" : "Mozgus was one of the Chief Inquisitors of the Holy See, traveling the world with his group of torturers, having been sent to root out a violent cult of heretics in the city of Albion. He is the main antagonist of the Conviction Arc, hindering http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts]` efforts in saving http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca] with his excessive religious zeal. His symbol is four breaking wheels, embodying his willingness to use torture as a way to \"cleanse people from evil\".\nMozgus is a tall, muscular and strong man with pale skin and blue eyes. His most distinguishing feature is his smooth, almost flat face that is the result of years of prostration, where he harshly kneels and slams his face into the floor. During his prayers, and whenever he is angry, his face becomes swelled with veins and he takes on a much more intimidating appearance. He wears a traditional pontiff`s garb, white with gold trimming and a red cloth that has the insignia of the Holy See. Lastly, he wears a red, wide-brimmed hat with ear covers.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
