  "description" : "Timburr is Linda`s main Pokémon and companion and the two of them go out to investigate disturbances in Driftveil City. Linda`s Timburr stopped the thief and his Ducklett by using its wood beam and strength to hold the thief`s getaway car from going anywhere. It was unable to defeat Vanipeti Gang Henchmen`s Vanillite as it was double teamed and frozen. It redeemed itself though when it helped fight the Vanipeti Gang with Swift Hero A☆Gilder at the docks and the gang members were arrested as a result.",
