  "description" : "Job Trunicht was an http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Alliance] politician and its penultimate head of state, leading what was widely perceived as an incompetent and corrupt administration, a symbol of the decline of http://anidb.net/ch1026 [Arle Heinessen]`s legacy. Though democratically elected, Job Trunicht used fear to maintain his power—fear of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire], and fear of his own secret police, the murderous http://anidb.net/ch82359 [Patriotic Knights Corps]. He was simply out for his own personal power and survival, becoming involved in factional politics and not caring for the future of the Alliance, despite outwardly preaching the opposite.\nTrunicht`s corruption was seen as one of the contributing factors to the fall of the Alliance and democracy to http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]. After the defeat of the Alliance in Operation Ragnarök he took responsibility for the defeat and resigned, having surrendered the Alliance because his life was threatened by the Imperial Fleet. Following the complete subjugation of the Alliance during the Second Alliance–Imperial War, Trunicht made dealings with both the Church of Terra and the New Galactic Empire, ultimately betraying all of the factions that he once claimed loyalty to.\nTrunicht was later shot by http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal] shortly before the latter`s own death, after having insulted Kaiser Reinhard in their conversation.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
