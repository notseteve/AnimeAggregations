  "description" : "Latias is a descendant of the famous Latios and Latias that saved the city of Alto Mare from a great evil. It spends most of its time in the Secret Garden so that it isn`t seen by the residents of the city, though it often ventures out into the city by making itself invisible or transforming into a girl that looks like Bianca (Alto Mare). Latias is a very curious Pok√©mon and her older brother Latios is always looking out for her.\nWhen and Annie arrived in the Secret Garden, Latios was able to protect Latias long enough for her to get away but Latios was captured and taken to the temple so it could be used to activate the Heart Drop machine. Latias recruited Ash and together they were able to rescue Latios.\nAs the tsunami wave approached Alto Mare, Latios combined its energy with Latias and they were able to stop the wave. Unfortunately, her brother scarified himself to protect the city.\nWith the events that had transpired in Alto Mare over, Ash and his friends left but he ended up getting a picture and a kiss from a person that looked like Bianca (Alto Mare) but he wasn`t sure if it was really her or Latias.",
