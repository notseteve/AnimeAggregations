  "description" : "The Bolinoak Sammahn is the third of the handmade mobile suits created by Paptimus Scirocco aboard the transport ship Jupitris. Equipped with a radome in its head and laser sensors in its left forearm, the Bolinoak is well-suited for patrol and reconnaissance missions. The shield integrated into its right arm - which houses a pair of multi-purpose beam sabres and a set of grappling claws - also gives it excellent close combat capabilities.",
