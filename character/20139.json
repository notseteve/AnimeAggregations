  "description" : "Guu can do strange things, which defy the laws of physics, logic, and reality, such as (but not limited to) superhuman strength, elongate her body parts, breathe under water, teleport, time travel, cause people to switch bodies, read minds, cause disco music to play suddenly, switch her face from a cute face to a completely plain face and non human-like, transform into a giant kaiju monster version of herself, and incite mental breakdowns in Haré, though the latter is more of a talent than an actual power.\nOther than Haré, no character seems to be aware of Guu`s strange nature (or for that matter the bizarre circumstances surrounding everything else in the series). The weird events that occur because of her are only ever acknowledged by Haré.\nGuu`s stomach is a world filled with unnatural beings like hundred legged cats, and a nice young couple of lovers that have been trapped there for ages and other versions of her self. Everyone who is eaten by Guu, only to be spat out later (excluding Haré) dismisses what happened as \"sleeping\" (occasionally, dreaming about Guu`s Stomach world).\nShe apparently has more than one stomach and cares enough about the people and creatures she swallows to keep dangerous things away from the area she keeps her `guests`. Despite all this, Guu actually cares for some of Hare`s personal problems, and often gives him advice with profound sayings- a lot of her powers are used to make Hare learn a lesson.",
