  "description" : "The opposing force in the unknown world, the Ends are, like the http://anidb.net/ch86429 [Drifters], mainly composed of powerful historical figures who died under unorthodox and often violent circumstances. Unlike the Drifters, however, the Ends are revered humans that have forsaken their humanity, and are thus capable of using supernatural powers. Most of the Ends are driven completely by an intense hate for humanity for the various betrayals each suffered back on Earth. They seem to have been brought into the new world by http://anidb.net/ch81504 [Easy], who is at odds with http://anidb.net/ch83939 [Murasaki].\nSource: Wikipedia",
