  "description" : "Rangui is one of the main villains of the series who keeps targeting Zakuro and was the black widow at the military gala case. The sisters Daidai and Byakuroku serve her, Rangui thinks Daidai is just a dirty little half-spirit and a failure. But Rangui told Byakuroku that as long as Byakuroku continues to serve her then Daidai will be treated the same way Byakuroku is. Rangui is able to use sorcery through papers and capable of transforming into a large and hideous spider-like monster. It is shown that Rangui has feelings for lieutenant Hanadate, but she soon learns that Hanadate is only using her to get what he wants.\nSource: Wiki",
