  "description" : "Daisya Barry is a 19-year-old Exorcist from Bodrum and a member of thehttp://anidb.net/ch32498 [ Black Order]`s http://anidb.net/ch32499 [European Branch].\nDaisya was a student of General http://anidb.net/ch32784 [Froi Tiedoll] who found Daisya in his hometown. Daisya was rebellious and rude as a child and fervently denied all interest in being an Exorcist. After his town was attacked by Akuma and he saw how cool General Tiedoll looked, he decided he would like to try and left home. Before he left, he used his soccer ball to kick down the doorbell his family used at their shop, saying it was the only thing in that house he was fond of besides his deadbeat father, nagging mother, two annoying brothers, and his crybaby sister.\nDaisya, http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda], and http://anidb.net/ch32930 [Marie] were sent to Barcelona, where General Tiedoll said he would be. Unfortunately for him, Daisya ran into http://anidb.net/ch7370 [Tyki Mikk] who killed him and destroyed his Innocence.\nThe Charity Bell, his Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon, hangs at the tip of his hat. When activated, it takes the form of a hollow ball which he can kick around. When the ball goes inside an Akuma`s body, it makes a ringing bell-like sound, which destroys the Akuma.\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
