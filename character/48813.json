  "description" : "Another variant to the standard Regult battle pod, the Heavy Missile Carrier utilizes two missile launchers in place of the standard aft-mounted anti-aircraft laser cannons. Using a single mount connected to the dorsal fuselage, the missile launchers of the Heavy Missile Carrier house only four heavy missiles. However, the missiles are outfitted with multiple warheads and are capable of destroying even the most heavily armored mecha. In most combat sorties, the Heavy Missile Carrier was used in conjunction with Light Missile Carriers and standard Regults, maximizing the combined arms of the Zentradi Regult mecha forces.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/reguld-heavy.htm",
