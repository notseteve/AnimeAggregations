  "description" : "Allen Schezar is a member of the Knight Caeli, Asturia`s elite knights who bears an uncanny resemblance to Hitomi`s high school crush, Susumu Amano.\nWhen Allen was younger, his younger sister Celena was kidnapped by Zaibach, his father disappeared mysteriously, and his mother died shortly afterwards. He has captured the heart of Princess Millerna of Asturia, but also demonstrates strong feelings for Hitomi as the series progresses.\nHe was a gifted swordsman at a young age, becoming one of the most skilled fighters of Gaea under the expert tutelage of Balgus of Fanelia. During his early knight career he and Princess Marlene fell in love and she bore his child, Chid. Later within the series, Allen briefly becomes romantically involved with Hitomi through Dornkirk`s influence.\nAllen also harbors a great deal of anger towards his father, Leon, for leaving his mother and family behind (it is later revealed that Leon truly loved Allen`s mother and was murdered by Dornkirk`s soldiers for the secrets of Atlantis.)",
