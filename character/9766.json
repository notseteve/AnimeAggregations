  "description" : "Orphen`s childhood friend and fellow sorcerer. They met at the Tower of Fangs. He is on Childman`s side, instead of Orphen`s, however, making it seem as though Hartia is Orphen`s enemy. However, Hartia truly cares about Orphen, and has never forgotten their friendship. He is also a fan of the (fictional) manga, Black Tiger, and assumes the guise of its main character and namesake on occasion. However, the manga is fairly obscure, so Majik mistakenly assumes his name refers to the Penaeus monodon, a type of prawn sometimes called \"Black Tiger\", resulting in Hartia`s receiving the nickname, \"Shrimp Man\", much to his own chagrin.",
