  "description" : "A large craft with a formidable armament, the Gnerl is the primary mass-production fighter for the Zentradi forces. Though possessing only a minimally aerodynamic hull, the Gnerl is nonetheless capable of operation within a planetary atmosphere by relying upon powerful thrusters and variable cant vectoring planes that double as control surfaces in an atmosphere. In space, the craft is ever more nimble and is capable of maintaining pace with the variable fighters of the UN Spacy. In combat, the Gnerl`s primary weapon is a forward mounted, triple-barrel beam gun that can fire rapid bursts from the non-rotating barrels (the gun discharges from each barrel in sequence). In addition to the main gun, the Gnerl features six internal missile launchers capable of firing up to four missiles in a single volley. A reliable craft with plenty of firepower, the Gnerl was used extensively during Space War One.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/gnerl.htm",
