  "description" : "Mimasaka Ryou, also known as \"Gorgon Shell\", uses \"Oshiroibori\" (白粉彫り) tattoos, which are almost invisible to the naked eye, to hypnotize the opponent to the point that their metabolism slows down so much that it leads to paralysis. She is however defeated by Onigiri whose unorthodox style of riding on his head reverses the tattoo effects and makes him more powerful to the point where she submits to him instead. She is very close to Sano Yasuyoshi and may have romantic feelings for him, having known him from their school days and works under him. She sacrifices herself to save Sano from being killed by Nike, though she is later revealed to be alive but on life-support and held hostage by Genesis in order to force Sano to work for them. Later it is revealed that she follows the path of the Gaia/Jade Road.",
