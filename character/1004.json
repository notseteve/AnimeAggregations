  "description" : "Seviper is a fully armed predator in both the wild and in Pok√©mon trainer battles. Secretly within both its fangs and its tail is a venomous poison, which is injected into its opponent through its fangs and sprayed onto the opponent from its tail. It also slashes at its foes with its tail as if it were a sword coated in venom. It uses these when hunting within its environment in the grasslands, jumping out at unsuspecting prey from within the grass it hides in. Seviper is forever the natural archrival of Zangoose; the two Pokemon always attack each other on sight and are willing to battle to the death.",
