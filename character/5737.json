She was the one that discovered Break in fatal condition after his eye was taken. When she was young, she used to call Break `Xarks-nii` as he was like a big brother to her. She wants to be of use to him. Sharon loves tea and cakes. She also looks a lot like her mother Shelly Reinsworth. After drinking she develops a queen complex. Oddly enough Oz finds this cool.",
