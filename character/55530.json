  "description" : "Himeko Nayotake is a famous Japanese astronaut who was chosen to participate in the Luna Frontier Project, a space project funded by the United States, making her the youngest active astronaut in history. By this, her dream about going into outer space finally comes true. She is a close friend of http://anidb.net/ch55412 [Kakeru Oozora] with whom she is in love.\nKakeru and Himeko often argue since Himeko can not understand Kakeru`s unscientific fantasies and his belief in silly fairy-tales about princess he calls Kaguya living on the Moon. She even tells him that he could have been an excellent astronaut, if only he could stop thinking about his fantasies. This results in a quarrel during which Kakeru reject the possibility to stay by her side since their opinions differ a lot. Understanding his words as rejection of her feelings, Himeko leaves Kakeru`s apartment sobbing.\nAt the end, when she returns from her mission, Kakeru greets her at the airport with roses and they make up while confessing their true feelings towards each other - even though Kakeru is aware of her feelings towards him.",
