  "description" : "Sawasaki Youko is a staff member of the MIAC team with Genma and Mina. She usually performs support duties such as driving them around or tapping radio communications. She is captured by Hei, who interrogates her for Yin`s location. She is murdered by Genma by putting her through ME Squeezer and probably also by torturing her in the process, as her body is left severely beaten, unlike Pavlichenko`s.",
