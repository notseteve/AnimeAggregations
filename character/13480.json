Hiling also frequently teases her comrades. Joining Revive Revival with the A-Laws, also with a special licence that allows her to act independently, Hiling is eager to battle with the Celestial Being and the Gundams. Hiling pilots a Gadessa and later a Garazzo in several operations against the Ptolemaios II.\nShe is later ordered by Ribbons to retreat from A-Laws to help in defending Veda. In the final battles, she is brutally killed by the returned Hallelujah/Allelujah supersoldier, crying out to Ribbons to save her as she dies.",
