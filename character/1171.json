  "description" : "Kricketune resembles a dark red cricket standing upright. Its forearms curve into scythe-like shapes (compare with Scyther), perhaps resembling conductor`s batons. It also has two large whiskers resembling a handlebar mustache above the nose. The \"mustache\" on the female is slightly smaller than the male`s. Kricketot`s name originates from the words cricket, spelled with a \"K,\" and tune, as in a musical tune.\nIts appearance resembles a violin, or double bass, with string-like lines on its neck. Due to these traits, its design could have been influenced by the real life violin beetle. But with its scythes, or bows (for a violin), it could most likely be instrument-designed, like its pre-evolution, Kricketot.\nBecause of it`s musical nature, Nando owns one as well.",
