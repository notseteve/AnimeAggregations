  "description" : "Vullaby is the pre-evolution of Mandibuzz and is only found in Pok√©mon Black. It resembles the baby of a vulture, having a plump, stout body, tiny wings, and stumpy feet. Its neck is short and supports a round head devoid of any feathers except for an enormous crest on the top. Below the middle part of its body, there seems to be a cracked egg, as it has the tendency to use broken skeleton pieces, most likely skulls, as diaper-like clothing to protect its rump. It will chase after weaker creatures. Its name means a baby vulture.",
