  "description" : "Electivire is Viren`s main partner Pokemon. Viren even resembles it a little. It battled against Kiawe`s Marowak in a one-on-one battle where Kiawe`s family farm was up for grabs. It was defeated when Kiawe did some training overnight after their first encounter near the fence where they lost, and it learned to use the Z-Move Inferno Overdrive to defeat Viren`s Electivire.",
