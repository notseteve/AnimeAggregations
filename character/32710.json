  "description" : "Kujikawa Rise is a cheerful-looking girl with violet-red hair tied in two pigtails. She was one of the most popular idols in Japan, but suddenly quit her job and transferred to Yasogami High School as a freshman to take a break from the spotlight and lead a normal life, away from the stress of fame. Rise grew up in Inaba, and her grandmother runs a shop in the shopping district, Marukyu Tofu, which Rise initially helps out at after her return. Her look is reminiscent to that of Yuka Ayase from Shin Megami Tensei: Persona. She takes over the role of support character once Teddie`s Persona awakens.",
