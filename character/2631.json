  "description" : "Lt. Surge is the Gym Leader of Vermilion City`s Gym, known officially as the Vermilion Gym. He hands out the Thunder Badge to Trainers who defeat him. He specializes in Electric-type Pokémon.\nLt. Surge made his only anime appearance in \"Electric Shock Showdown\", and in flashback appearances focused on Ash`s Pikachu.\nLt. Surge is an extremely large and muscular man, and seems to be the show`s tallest human character. He is arrogant, loud, and crude, and refers to all trainers as \"babies\" until they manage to defeat him. Lt. Surge generally looks down on unevolved Pokémon, preferring to evolve them as soon as possible.\nHis Raichu shares many of his personality traits, also appearing to be rather tough. Lt. Surge`s fatal weakness was that he evolved his Pokémon too quickly without taking the time to teach them the proper attacks. Even though he managed to defeat Ash and his Pikachu once with pure power, Pikachu was able to use speed-altering moves like Agility to get the best of Raichu.\nIn the anime, the Vermilion Gym appears to be a warehouse decorated with stylized lighting bolts.",
