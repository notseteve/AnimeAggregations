  "description" : "A classically demure Japanese maiden from a wealthy family (Kujou family implied), Asuna is pretty, kind-hearted, shy around people and innocent to a fault. Her family and Shun`s uncle has arranged a traditional Japanese marriage between she and Shun (against Shun`s wishes). In contrast to Shun, Asuna is a dog lover and she is initially attracted to Shun (approving of their engagement) because her many dogs seem to approve of him. Shun would like to end their arranged engagement, but often finds himself unable to, either because of his fear of her dogs or his fear of hurting her feelings (mirroring the situation between Yuusaku and Kozue). Asuna is initially unaware of Shun`s feelings for Kyouko, but she is not above pursuing Shun, albeit in her own fashion.",
