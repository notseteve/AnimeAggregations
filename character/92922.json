  "description" : "Kashou`s younger sister, and the catgirls` actual owner. Considerably younger than Kashou, she is still in that active and boisterous phase despite her attachment to him. She has quite the talent for economics and in fact secretly runs her own business. She can`t leave the nest yet, though, so she elects to help Kashou from the shadows, a hidden pillar of support. Not that she doesn`t run wild on occasion, of course.",
