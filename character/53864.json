  "description" : "Ellie`s Ampharos lives with Ellie and her grandpa Tokuzo at the Sangi Ranch. It helps her grandpa Tokuzo raise Merriep by watching over them and to make sure they don`t get into trouble. Ellie had been trying to help her Denryu perfect its ThunderPunch when Ash and his friends stopped by the ranch. Ellie was very grateful to Iris` Dragonite for it coaching Denryu to perfect ThunderPunch.\nEllie`s Ampharos is a very timid Pokémon and the Merriep took advantage of that weakness and didn`t listen to it. Tokuzo wanted to trade Ellie`s Ampharos at a Pokémon Trade Meet in the neighboring town but Ellie knew that her Denryu was doing its best and asked to let her watch it a bit longer to help it improve. Her faith in Denryu proved to be well placed as Ellie`s Ampharos fought off Team Rocket with its perfected ThunderPunch and protected the Merriep from being stolen.\nAfter protecting the Merriep, they began to listen to it and follow its orders. Ellie and Tokuzo were both grateful that they had a good protector for the Merriep.",
