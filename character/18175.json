  "description" : "Bonbori and Hoozuki are cheerful half-spirit girls who look like normal identical twin girls with fox ears atop their heads. They are chosen as spirit representatives in the Ministry of Spirit Affairs and are partnered with Hanakiri Ganryu. They think the idea of a Ministry of Spirit Affairs sounds like fun and are delighted to be working with humans. They immediately take a liking to Hanakiri and tease him about many things he says. They become extremely excited and happy when they learn Hanakiri can tell them apart despite the fact that they are exactly identical except for their voices. When Zakuro fights, they assist by singing and waving a branch of cherry blossoms provided by Sakura and Kiri.\nBonbori and Hoozuki specialize in magic petals, which they attach to people and use to sense the presence of that person. However, the petals only work when one of the twins is singing. When a petal is destroyed, the singing twin is injured because they put part of their soul into the petals.\nSource: Wiki",
