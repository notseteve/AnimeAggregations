  "description" : "Just like Eclair and Lumiere, Alv is an ES member of the GOTT. She works with her partner Dvergr to ensure normal economic activity in the Galaxy in which the anime is set. Alv is the more vocal of the pair and disliked by most ES members, specifically Tweedledee and Eclair. As an S Class ES Member, she is particularly powerful.\nAlv claims she works for herself, but is willing to play the pawn when it suits her needs. She shows no particular affection or empathy for anyone, not even her partner Dvergr, who is actually her own mother. She also takes pleasure in killing people and shows no remorse for her actions.\nAlv and Dvergr both have the power of Reflex and Absorb. To escape a gravity bomb, they activate \"Reflex,\" which allows them to act normally, in spite of the increased gravity. \"Absorb\" is only available when both Alv and Dvergr activate it; it allows them to absorb virtually anything, from energy to people, allowing them access to their appearance and abilities.",
