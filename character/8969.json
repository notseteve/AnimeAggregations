  "description" : "Canaan is a mercenary operating in Shanghai. She was the only survivor of a village destroyed by war in the Middle East before being found and trained by http://anidb.net/ch10772 [Siam], who has her adopting the name Canaan. She developed a respect for her mentor during the course of her training, and later to http://anidb.net/ch8970 [Alphard], Siam`s former student who she saw as an older sister figure, as well. When Alphard betrayed both her and Siam during a mission and left Siam to die, Canaan was consumed by the quest for revenge. Canaan gets serious whenever she sees Alphard. As an elite mercenary, Canaan is also a skilled marksman and an expert at combat. Her synesthesia allows her to view the world in different colors to tell enemies from civilians, aiding her in combat. She is always seen with a red halterneck shirt and brown pants.\nSource: Wikipedia",
