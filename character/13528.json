  "description" : "The League Militaire is a rogue organization poised to defend the Earth from the invasion by the Zanscare Empire during the late U.C. 0140s to the early U.C. 0150s. Their main force consists of the mass-produced LM312V04 Victory Gundam and its variants, the LM111E02 Gun-EZ, the LM111E03 Gunblastor , and its flagship mobile suit, the LM314V21 Victory 2 Gundam, all of which are stored on either the Reinforce, Reinforce Jr. and White Ark battleships. Like the AEUG, many of its members are ex-Federation officers or currently active pilots.\nThe Militaire is sponsored by Anaheim Electronics and is generally of the same rag-tag structure. They are not above using captured enemy ships and mobile suits or even decades old weapons like the Alexandria-class cruisers for its small fleet. The League Militaire`s primary objective is to assist (or in some cases, simply fight in place of) the Earth Federation against the Zanscare Empire. Their record of service is documented in the series Mobile Suit Victory Gundam.",
