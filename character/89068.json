  "description" : "Hanabatake Yoshiko is a high school girl who is stupid both academically and socially. She even gets zeroes on multiple choice tests. However what she lacks intellectual capacity she makes up with lots of spunk, ridiculous audacity and lots of energy when it comes to what she wants.\nShe frequently hangs out with her neighbor, childhood best friend and classmate http://anidb.net/ch89069 [Akutsu Akuru] whom she calls \"Akkun\", profiles much to his annoyance. Her favorite food is bananas, where she can tell every bit of detail about its variety, texture and how it`s grown.\nSource: Wikipedia",
