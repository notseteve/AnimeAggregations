  "description" : "Yuu is good friends with http://anidb.net/ch6569 [Meguru] and http://anidb.net/ch6567 [Misaki], and is also http://anidb.net/ch6557 [Kei]`s older sister. She is a cheery girl who never hesitates to make friends. Although she appears to be a little ditsy, she carries an avid interest for just about everything, making her very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects. As a result, she, like her sister, garners a lot of attention from many guys. However, whether its being oblivious or just nonchalant, she doesn`t seem to mind being friendly with all of them. She also seems to be younger than her little sister, because of her small size and child-like innocence.",
