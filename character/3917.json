  "description" : "A large tailess yellow fox-like creature with a duiker-like horns on his head, ten blue beady eyes (with the main pair three to six times larger than the other pairs), black bat-like wings, brown stripes on his limbs and with no visible ears that helps Ueki awaken his celestial powers.\nHe can also change his shape to fit onto Ueki`s wrist like an arm protector used by goaltenders in ice hockey to give him advice, and seems to be able to communicate with Ueki telepathically. He is a Heavenly Beast who is something of a mutation among his kind (he is born as an ancient version of Heavenly Beast, which is a ferocious-looking Godzilla-sized fox-like creature instead of an adorable cat-sized genetically-engineered house pet).\nHe is treated very poorly by Heavenly Beings and Ueki is the first to actually treat him with some kindness and respect. He is able to detect the power level of Heavenly Beings and because of his mutations has a bigger version of what is called the \"awakening organ\" that can awaken the hidden powers within Ueki.",
