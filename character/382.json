  "description" : "Rhydon appears to be a cross between a rhinoceros and a dinosaur. It is a massive, gray, bipedal creature with clawed forepaws and hindfeet and a long tail. Rhydon`s head has two horns: one is on its forehead, and another one at the end of its snout. The latter is bigger and seems to be styled after a drill. After the production of Pokémon Diamond/Pearl, it is revealed that the male Rhydon has a longer drill horn than the female.\nRhydon`s brain is considerably more developed than that of its pre-evolved form Rhyhorn, which allows it to exhibit some signs of advanced intelligence, including the ability to stand upright and walk on two legs. It is capable of living in molten lava under the ground.\nRhydon is notable for being one of the very few non-water rock type Pokémon to learn the move surf.",
