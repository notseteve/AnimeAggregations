  "description" : "The legendary \"Red Comet\" has now reappeared as the leader of his own Neo Zeon movement. During the One Year War, Char fought for the Principality of Zeon as an ace mobile suit pilot. He then helped found the AEUG resistance group, which opposed the tyranny of the Federation`s Titans faction - a role which put Char briefly on the same side as his former adversaries Amuro Ray and Bright Noa. However, Char`s new goal is to complete the work of his father Zeon Zum Deikun by forcing all of humanity to emigrate to space, and he once again faces Amuro as an adversary. Amongst themselves, Neo Zeon`s officers suspect that Char`s true purpose is simply to avenge himself upon Amuro, and that their glorious cause is merely an afterthought.\nSource: Official Site",
