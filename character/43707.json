  "description" : "A female Protodeviln who resembles a vampire, Sivil is awakened by http://anidb.net/ch43648 [Gigile], but being an undisciplined, free spirit, she ignores the other Protodeviln in order to seek her own supply of spiritia. She becomes fascinated by http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Nekki Basara], whom she terms Anima Spiritia, and possesses human women in an attempt to get close to him. However, his singing appears to cause her pain (or overwhelming pleasure), driving her away many times, and when she finally manages to kiss him, the energy released sends her into a coma. She is later reawakened byhttp://anidb.net/ch10993 [ Basara] and http://anidb.net/ch43648 [Gigile]`s combined singing, but http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti] considers her a danger to his plan and seeks to destroy her. Though she never returns http://anidb.net/ch43648 [Gigile]`s feelings, she is shocked by his sacrifice in her name, and because of this seeks to protect http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara] from the other Protodeviln, and indeed, from her own desire to feed on his spiritia.Source: wiki",
