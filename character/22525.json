It was in an underwater ballet written by Violet, one of Misty`s three sisters.\nAfter successfully attacking Jessie`s Arbok, it evolved and afterwhich froze Team Rocket with its Ice Beam attack. In the end, the show was saved by Daisy`s Dewgong. Unfortunately it hasn`t been seen since and most likely remains at the Cerulean City gym.",
