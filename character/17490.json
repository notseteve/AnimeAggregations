  "description" : "Proto is http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9]`s only (prototype) bioroid member and was also the http://anidb.net/ch9577 [Tachikoma]`s maintenance technician (before becoming one of the new recruits). During the Dejima crisis Proto played a key role in helping http://anidb.net/ch1588 [Aramaki] rescue the Prime Minister http://anidb.net/ch17466 [Kayabuki Youko], who had been relieved of her duty and arrested under charges of treason.\nProto managed to gain access to the net, where he communicated with Section 9`s Tachikoma units. Through them Proto was able to gain building blueprints and up-to-date information on Section 9`s Dejima operation, as well as the location of the Prime Minister, before an attack barrier disabled him. Proto appears again in the http://anidb.net/a4414 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society] movie, wearing the black uniform of Section 9 along with a sidearm, which suggests that he is now a field officer.",
