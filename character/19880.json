She defeats him in the first round of the War Games, though loses to him during their rematch in the third. In both of her battles with Jack, at some point Jack is comically hit in the groin by Pano. Using Jack`s mushrooms, it`s discovered she`s scared of bats, being immobilized, leeches, and likes pretty flowers and butterflies.",
