In particular, he`s been looking after his childhood friends; Futa Kaminoshima and Misaki Goto, oftentimes scolding them, for many arduous years. In reality, he`s actually a cry baby who succumbs to loneliness but, oftentimes, refuses to say it outright. He`s very close with his parents and his adoration to classical music comes from them. Since he took piano lessons before, you would often see and hear him play the keyboard in some songs.",
