  "description" : "Chatot can learn and speak human words (known as Chatter). The ability to learn human words is rare. It may or may not be able to comprehend what it is actually saying though, much like real parrots. If they gather, they all learn the same saying. It can also mimic sounds. When a Chatot learns its signature move Chatter, the trainer can record a custom call from the game menu. The sound is garbled to avoid the recording of obscenities. The player can trade this Pokemon for a Buizel in Eterna City.\nIts head is shaped like a musical note and its tail like a metronome. Its body is covered with many multi-colored feathers giving it a resemblance to a black masked lovebird. Chatot can only be caught in the morning or during the day.\nChatot also appears in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness as the second in command to Guildmaster Wigglytuff.",
