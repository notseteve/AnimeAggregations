  "description" : "Purugly is the evolved form of Glameow. It is a grey-and-white creature that resembles a feline with a rather large body and short legs. Its two whiskers are bent at the ends. Wild ones are known to be brazen and will attempt to invade another Pokémon`s nest on sight. A Purugly`s head, like its previous evolution, Glameow, resembles a crescent, though the purple-tipped ears have a fringe at the end.\nIt is exclusive to Pokémon Pearl, where Glameow is used by many of the members of the Team Galactic antagonists; Galactic Commander Mars uses a Purugly. These Pokémon are surprisingly quick for being so robust. As to confirm a Glameow`s transition from slender to fat during evolution, a Glameow with the Limber ability will exchange it for the Thick Fat ability during evolution. A Purugly can also have the Own Tempo ability, which prevents confusion.",
