  "description" : "Lantern`s true identity is http://anidb.net/ch76473 [Minami Uruka], who is a beautiful classmate of http://anidb.net/ch76602 [Arima Kishou] and http://anidb.net/ch76474 [Fura Taishi]. She tried to get close to Arima in order to kill him, only defeated by him and finished by Fura, who pitied her after talking to her in her final moments. She seemed to envy the lives of humans and killed http://anidb.net/ch76472 [Taishi`s friend] because he didn`t value his human life enough and spent it doing pointless things.\nHer Bikaku Kagune was used to make http://anidb.net/ch76601 [Taishi]`s Quinque Lantern, and he admits he has mixed feelings about it.\nSource: Wikipedia",
