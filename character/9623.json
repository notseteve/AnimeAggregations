  "description" : "Once known as Fleda Claes Johansson, this girl was the daughter of a professor who enriched in her a love for books at an early age. It is unknown how she became acquainted with the Social Welfare Agency. In the beginning, Claes is confined to the Agency, unable to participate in missions with the other girls because her handler, Raballo, has died. She is used as a test subject by the cyborg engineers, who utilize controlled situations and equipment to monitor the usefulness of her implants. Claes wears glasses from her life before her cybernetic operation as a visual reminder of the promise she once made to Raballo and is knowledgeable and mature for her age.\nClaes`s preferred weapons were the H&K VP70M and the MP5K PDW.",
