He eventually retires from his position due his advanced age and poor health, but maintains much of his influence. He dotes on http://anidb.net/ch93274 [Hina] in a grandfatherly way, even using yakuza resources to assist her in such situations as running for student council president, and encourages Nitta to take a more active interest in raising her.\nSource: Wikipedia",
