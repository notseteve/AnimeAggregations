  "description" : "Eiscue is an Ice-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nWhile it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, Eiscue can change forms with its Ice Face Ability.\nEiscue is a small penguin-like Pokémon with a large ice cube on its head. This ice cube is a light blue, with specks of white seen dotting the surface of it. Two oval-shaped eyes and a beak are seen on the front of it, with a long, antennae-like hair sticking out of the cube. The body of Eiscue has two flipper and yellow feet, with three toes on each. It’s true face within ice is colored light blue with two white eyes. It has two black eyebrows and a white beak.\nEiscue originates from extremely cold areas. It can produce cold air from inside its head to create ice to protect its head from heat. The ice, however, is not very durable, as a strong blow can shatter it, after which it goes on to create new ice. Eiscue are easygoing and are often seen aimlessly floating in the ocean with just its ice-covered head floating on the surface, occasionally washing up on distant shores. It never panics or gets upset when it ends up in a new land. It simply carries on thanks to its ability to adapt[1]. People love the face silly worried expression Eiscue shows when the head ice shatters. Eiscue`s hair is connected to the surface of brain, which then chills the air around it when it has something on its mind. The hair is also used to catch prey in the sea.",
