  "description" : "The Egg of the Perfect World is a deformed outcast of society who became an apostle, watching over the city of Albion. He ultimately acts as the key needed to reconstitute http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith] into a corporal form by means of self-sacrifice.\nThe apostle believes in purpose and faith; he admires those who show great passion for their beliefs, such as the cult leader and lord http://anidb.net/ch82450 [Mozgus], to whom he grants great powers. He himself does not like killing and avoids it whenever possible. As a human, he was an outcast who lived on the fringes of society, keeping himself out of sight in an underground tunnel. Hence, he is kind and sympathetic to the misshapen and downtrodden, granting the Demon Child peace by ingesting it and allowing the child to play a part in the birth of the Perfect World. Unlike many apostles, the Egg of the Perfect World is selfless and believes in creating a better world, not for himself, but for the betterment of others.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
