It was able to adjust the speed of the cart by adjusting how much electricity it generated.\n2-on-2 Battle against Satoshi and Dent\nAs Cilan completed the stamp rally, he got the opportunity to battle the Subway Masters. Subway Boss Emmet sent out his Eelektross to battle against Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Tepig. The battle started off slowly for the Subway Masters as Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Tepig worked well together. Subway Boss Emmet`s Eelektross and Subway Boss Ingo`s Chandelure fought back though as Subway Boss Emmet`s Eelektross used Acid on Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Tepig and made them lose their momentum. Subway Boss Emmet`s Eelektross then used Thunderbolt on the handrail in order to paralyze Cilan`s Pansage who then fell on Ash`s Tepig. It then finished them off with a Thunderbolt to give the Subway Masters the win in the 2-on-2 battle.",
