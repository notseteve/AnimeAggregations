  "description" : "Saturn makes part of Team Galactic`s Commander foursome.\nUnlike the games, he knows about his syndicate`s goal to capture Dialga and Palkia.\nSaturn made his first appearance at the ending of \"A Secret Sphere of Influence!\", though it was a brief appearance at the end of the episode. He, along with the other Team Galactic Grunts, commented that Jessie, James and Meowth did a lousy job at stealing the Adamant Orb for them, and framing Nando for the crime.\nSaturn later reappeared in \"Journey to the Unown!\", along with his Bronzor. He managed to steal a cube that was under the guard of the Unown of the Solaceon Ruins and brought it with him back to the Team Galactic HQ.\nSaturn appeared again in \"Enter Galactic!\", with the cube he obtained in \"Journey to the Unown!\", which he exposed to the meteorites in Veilstone City, transforming it into the Spear Key. Later, he and a few Galactic Grunts went to go steal the meteorites, but ended up meeting Ash and his friends for the first time. He also battles Brock and his Croagunk with his own Toxicroak, but it ends in a draw, as Team Galactic retreats and fails their mission.\nHe appeared in DP096 and DP097, along with Cyrus, Jupiter and Mars. They stole the Lustrous Orb and the Adamant Orb from the Celestic Town museum.",
