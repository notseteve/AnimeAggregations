  "description" : "A youkai in the form of a man with half of his body that looks like a wood. He was seen fighting Setsura 400 years ago. He is quite rude. He wields a Daishou and is currently preparing to fight Kubinashi and Kejourou, and later Kurotabou. His Hatsu is \"Onideko\" which allows him to manipulate lightning and can shoot lightning no matter which direction Ibaraki Douji is facing. He is a youkai who likes to see blood. The reason for this is because long ago, an old couple prayed for a child and found Ibaraki Douji who have been abandoned beside a shrine. The old man was a barber and he taught his skill to Ibaraki Douji. One day, Ibaraki Douji injured one of his customers, he panicked and without realising it, he licked the blood on his hand. He remembered the taste of blood because he was an Oni. He was feared and threw out of his hometown. He killed his customer and father and soon his named was known by the whole nation. It was then Shuten Doji, the commander of oni reached out to him. Shuten Douji was the first one to accept him and made him his son. Nue became the leader of the oni after killing Shuten Douji. The wood on his face acts as a stupa for Shuten Douji who now resides in Ibaraki Douji`s left cheek.",
