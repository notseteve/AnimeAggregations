  "description" : "Sandaconda is a Ground-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves from Silicobra starting at level 36. It also has a Gigantamax form.\nSandaconda is a tan serpent Pokémon with a black and brown pattern resembling cracked earth. Around its neck is a dark brown ring, its neck pouch, featuring the same pattern as the rest of its long body, which is coiled in a spiral shape. It has lime green eyes with red bags underneath them and a snout with two prominent nostrils and two fangs.\nSandaconda uses its inflated sand pouch to protect its head from harm. The pouch can store up to 220 pounds of sand for a time. The pouch is very elastic and thick to the point a Durant`s pincers cannot harm it. Sandaconda can contract its body to spray the sand stored in the pouch through its nose with tremendous force, and its unique method of coiling allows it to blast its sand more efficiently. The sand is mixed with sharp pieces of gravel, making it so dangerous that just coming in contact with it will cause lacerations. While Sandaconda may act tough and confident, it will become timid and cowardly the moment it runs out of sand. Sandaconda is a natural predator of Durant.\nWhen Gigantamaxed, the sand overflows from the pouch and forms a ring around Sandaconda`s neck, with total amount of sand swirling around its body now reaching 1,000,000 tons. Gigantamax Sandaconda resembles an enormous tornado, and it attacks by spinning its body at high speeds, causing the sand to move at incredible speeds and inflicting massive damage to anything that touches it. It is powerful enough to pulverize a skyscraper in this way.\nGigantamax Sandaconda is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Sandblast.",
