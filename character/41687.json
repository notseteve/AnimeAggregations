  "description" : "Introduced as Rias`s fiance (but that changes when his ulterior motives are revealed and Rias`s disgust of him), Raiser is a high ranking devil. Because the Phenex family has inherent powers that are equivalent of the legendary creature, Phoenix (which the family`s name is also derived from), Raiser`s abilities reflects that of a phoenix where he can regenerate from almost any injuries immediately and is practically impossible to defeat. It is said that the Phenex family`s tears sell for a high price because of its powerful healing abilities and as a result, the Phenex family is very wealthy. As a high ranking devil, Raiser has his own group of a full fifteen servants, all consisting of females, something which Issei both looks up to and envies at the same time.",
