  "description" : "Katsulla, Not Corolla is http://anidb.net/ch1165 [Katsura Kotarou]`s guardian spirit. When he got in a traffic accident, his soul was split in two. One half entered a Corolla, and the other was bound to hell, but was given a ride to his body by the Corolla and safely made it through.\nEver since, he kept the spirit of the car around even after it went out of service, used it to escape in emergencies, and came to be known as \"Runaway Kotarou\". In return for that power, he would be put under the \"Katsura, Not Zura\" curse, meaning he had to always drag the Corolla around with his hair and abuse his hair roots too the limit.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
