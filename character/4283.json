  "description" : "A sophomore at Mizuno High School. Ever since he was little, girls have teased him about his height and \"cute\" boyish face. Because of this he develops an extreme allergy towards all women and will break out into massive hives if a woman were to touch him. Because of this, he hasn`t been able to fully experience the joys of adolescence. Except for his childhood friend, Kirie Kojima, most girls from his class call him \"Puny-Nari\" and keep a good distance from him. He is accidentally and mysteriously transported to an alternate universe, to the city of Seiren, and meets Miharu who then returns to live with him on earth.",
