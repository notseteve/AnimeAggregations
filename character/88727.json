  "description" : "Shirou Kotomine is http://anidb.net/ch88734 [Assassin of Red]`s Master and initially the stand-in master for all the other servants with the exception of the http://anidb.net/ch88728 [Saber of Red].\nShirou`s true name is Amakusa Shirou Tokisada, the teenage leader of the Shimabara Rebellion. Born in the Edo period, he was a boy of miracles who could nearly be called a saint. However, how exactly he was discovered; a good half of his lifetime is wrapped in mystery. He, who concentrated on his studies since childhood, began to perform many miracles at the frontier for a time. Having healed wounds and walked on water, he eventually began to be enthusiastically worshiped as son of God by the peasants that believed in a prohibited religion.\nIn reality, he was merely a spellcaster. He wasn`t taught magecraft but it was something that came to him naturally but very rarely. His use of magecraft was mostly subconscious, so he had not even realized it himself. It just so happened that he was born with the power to exercise the miracles called magecraft, and no one around him ever pointed it out, and so he was revered as a boy of miracles.\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
