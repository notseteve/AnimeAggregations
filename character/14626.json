  "description" : "Karin is the protagonist of the series. Her name literally means \"The Flower Bell of the Flower Garden,\" with the \"Flower Garden\" as her surname and \"Flower Bell\" as her given name. Karin used to live with her aunt because her parents died a long time ago, but she moved in with Kazune and Himeka after they found out about her goddess powers. She is an outgoing person, even though she does bad in school and sticks up for her friends. She had a cat named Shii-chan that passed away in the beginning of the first series. In the first series, she has recently ended 6th grade and starts 7th in volume 1, and is 14 years old. In Chu she is in 8th grade and is 15 years old (Stated in volume 1 of Chu). The ring Karin originally thought was her mother`s ring allows her to borrow godly power. Her ring is silver and has the power of the goddess Athena (Aphrodite in Chu). It is later revealed in the later volumes of the manga that Karin is actually Kazune Kujyou`s wife, Suzuka Kujyou, (Suzuka is Karin backwards, since suzu is another way to read the character rin), which was stated in Volume 7 that Karin was returned to an infant by Kazune Kujyou. It is shown that whenever Kazune becomes drunk, even with the so much as the smell of alcohol, he acts perverted towards Karin. They end up together and will end up loving each other with out either of them knowing at first in the beginning of the anime. At the end of the sequel of the manga, it is shown that she and Kazune get married.",
