  "description" : "The Blitz Gundam is one of four prototype Earth Alliance mobile suits captured by ZAFT. Its X200-series frame is designed to support special weapons, in particular the Mirage Colloid system which renders the mobile suit totally invisible to radar, infra-red sensors, and even the naked eye. Using its stealth capabilities to infiltrate enemy territory, the Blitz can then carry out surprise attacks with its rocket-propelled grappling claw and the various weapons built into its Trikeros shield system. After its capture, this machine is assigned to ZAFT pilot Nicol Amalfi.",
