  "description" : "In Hinduism Saraswati is the goddess of knowledge, music, arts, science and technology. Her Japanese name is http://anidb.net/ch40649 [Benzaiten].\nThe name Saraswati came from \"saras\" (meaning \"flow\") and \"wati\" (meaning \"she who has ...\"), i.e. \"she who has flow\". So, Saraswati is symbol of knowledge; its flow (or growth) is like a river and knowledge is supremely alluring, like a beautiful woman. She is depicted as beautiful fair Goddess with four arms, wearing spotless white saree and seated on white lotus.\nSaraswati is the guardian of earth. She also guides the souls of the deceased to find their way to the afterlife. Her symbolic animal is the cock, whose crowing calls the pious to their religious duties.\nIn http://anidb.net/a8 [Aquarian Age], becoming Saraswati (and thus the leader of the http://anidb.net/ch40610 [Darklore] faction, and a demon lord rather than a goddess) is one of two possible fates of http://anidb.net/ch5896 [Sannou Yoriko].",
