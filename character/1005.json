  "description" : "Lunatone is a floating, sentient meteorite in the iconic shape of a crescent, instead of a moon. Its body is a stone-like beige color, and it has two large, intimidating eyes, one on either side. It also sports a rather odd, beak-like protuberance in the middle of the crescent.\nLunatone was first discovered forty years ago in Meteor Falls, a cave in Hoenn, its only known habitat. Meteor Falls, as its name suggests, is full of meteorites and the craters left by them as they impacted the planet`s surface, suggesting that Lunatone (and Solrock) as partners, have their origins in outer space. Lunatone is greatly connected to the moon, and its vitality ebbs and flows depending on the lunar cycle. Lunatone`s power and activity is greatest during the full moon, and weakest during the day and when the moon is new. Anyone who looks at its glowing red eyes becomes transfixed with fear.",
