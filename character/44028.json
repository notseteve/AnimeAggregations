  "description" : "Muku was a Kusagakure shinobi that appears in Naruto 5: Blood Prison.\nMuku lost his mother as a baby and was raised by his father, Mui, the guardian of the Box of Ultimate Bliss. He was regarded as a prodigy of his village and, therefore, his chakra was chosen to open the box in hopes of returning Kusagakure to its former glory. The day before it happened, Muku promised his best friend, Ryuuzetsu, that he would return no matter what happened. Unfortunately, Muku`s chakra wasn`t enough and he was sucked into the box instead where he spent ten years trapped in despair and grief.\nSource: Narutopedia",
