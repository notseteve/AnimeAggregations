  "description" : "Rasati is the undefeated champion of the bishop class in the illegal fighting arena Milliard Trey in Razfe Ankul. Ten years ago, the owner of Milliard Trey bought Lillia so she can react with an arena fighter. Rasati vowed to become a fighter in Lillia`s place. As a deal with the owner, she fights to earn money to pay for the freedom of Lillia and herself Also to pay back the money that her father owed. Rasati at first fights on her own. She is strong enough to take down even Pleja. After defeating Coud in the arena, she earns enough money to free Lillia, but she is tricked. Lillia reacts with Rasati to finally earn their freedom. In the anime, she later reappears at the final battle, now fighting for Arc Aile while wearing their symbol around her neck, clearing the way for Cou and the others to rescue Ren from Chaos Choir with Wolx at her side. At the anime`s end, Rasati is last seen trying on \"women`s\" clothing with Lillia, something she was not very comfortable with since she says they don`t suit her.",
