  "description" : "Vice Head Chef of the Bishoku-kai. Having a bug-like appearance, complete with wings, Tommy raises \"parasite bugs\" inside his body and can spew them out at will. His lack of emotion allows him to fight at complete efficiency, focusing solely on the goal at hand. It is also revealed that his armbands allow him to limit his strength. He is the first Bishoku-kai to seriously fight Toriko head-to-head (without using a GT Robo) with the intent to kill him. He is one of the few Bishoku-kai members that Alfaro says are capable of entering the Gourmet World.",
