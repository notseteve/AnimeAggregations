  "description" : "Kuu is quite the normal high school girl who feels as if she is drifting through her existence and she always describes herself as being \"empty\". She never misses a chance to give letters to the mysterious prince in her dreams and frequently talks to him in her thoughts. In reality she is an introverted girl, believing that she lacks good qualities. She appears to be easily overwhelmed by situations that deviate from her previous experiences and expectations.\nHer original name is Cielo, meaning sky, who is the original Absolute Angel researched by Kazuya and his grandfather. During the incident ten years prior to the main story, Cielo is split into four pieces, Murakumo, Batraz, Cla√≠omh Solais and Megingjord. In addition, Megingjord is separated into two pieces. Kuu is the original body, while Valteishia is the soul; this explains Kuu`s initial feelings that she is lacking something inside.",
