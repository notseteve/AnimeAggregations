  "description" : "European aristocrats came together many years ago to create the industrial combine known as the Romefeller Foundation. They backed the Alliance and funded its forces, as well as OZ`s, and it was they who began production of mobile suits for military use in AC 176. Their main goal, however, is to gain control of the entire earth.\nRomefeller spearheads the movement to bring mobile dolls into the OZ forces. Treize Khushrenada disagrees with it, and Duke Dermail, head of Romefeller, pushes him to resign. When this happens, OZ splits between those loyal to Romefeller, which now come out of the background of the world scene, and those loyal to Treize. Romefeller is the dominant power, crushing its opposition. It then sets its sights on the countries that oppose its rule, calling this military action Operation Nova. One of these countries attacked is the Sanc Kingdom, which had influence over Romefeller`s supporters. Its ruler, Relena Peacecraft, dissolves the nation to avoid the bloodshed.\nThe general public greatly dislikes Romefeller, so Dermail decides to install Relena as a puppet ruler. She accepts, becoming Queen, and made a rousing speech about how they could now peacefully rule the earth as a World Nation. Surprisingly, with the exception of Dermail, all the Romefeller members take her side. Dermail goes off into space to gain support there, but his shuttle is destroyed by members of the newly formed White Fang and he is killed. Following the destruction of Libra, the Romefeller foundation is eventually dissolved.",
