  "description" : "Mitsuba Mutsumi is Takatoshi`s classmate who forms a judo club at the start of the series. She is dedicated to leading her club, but is also simple-minded. She develops a crush on Takatoshi later in the series and, despite her remarkable potential and drive towards the martial arts, states that her dream is to simply become a bride; in one instance, she combines his family name Tsuda with her given name Mutsumi. Because of her pure maiden nature, she often misses the perverted innuendos from Aria and Shino.\nSource: Wiki",
