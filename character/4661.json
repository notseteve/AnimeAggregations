  "description" : "Kevin is a mercenary who works out of Emporium. He`s a bit gruff, but not a bad guy. Every so often he`ll show up to give Honoka a key piece of information, or to pass on the latest rumours among the mercenary crowd - after teasing her a bit, of course. Though he tends to butt heads with Honoka, it`s all in good fun.",
