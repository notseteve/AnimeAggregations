  "description" : "Grew up with Yukinari and is also a sophomore at Mizuno High School. Beautiful, highly intelligent and athletic; she is in a sense, \"perfect\". She is liked by most, and for that reason has many male suitors, but as of now, she seems not to want a serious relationship. In her heart of hearts, she would like to get to know Yukinari more, but pride gets in the way and she uses sarcasm to hide her feelings. Generally speaking, she`s a big sister figure, unless it`s dealing with Fukuyama, who`s always making unwanted sexual advances towards her. She retaliates against Fukuyama`s aggressive advances by using power punches or skilled wresting.",
