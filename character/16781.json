  "description" : "Takagi Saya is first making her escape with fellow classmate Kohta Hirano, she is the daughter of an influential Uyoku dantai politician and her family is deeply involved in Japan`s politics. A self-proclaimed genius, Saya`s knowledge and deductive capabilities have allowed the group to escape from harm. She was among the first to conclude that \"they\" were attracted to only sound. Despite coming from a prestigious family she despises her parents whom she thought had given up on her in this crisis. It was before their escape from the mansion that she managed to makeup with her parents. Other than Rei, she is the only one who has a history with Takashi Komuro since they were children and is hinted to having deeper feelings for him.\nSlightly self-conscious, she detests the fact that people neither address her by her first name nor look her in the eyes while speaking. The only exception to this is Kohta with whom she has a strange friendship. Saya`s grown very attached to Alice and acts like a mother figure in this time of crisis. She does her best to keep intact Alice`s innocence and will severely scold anyone who would dare attempt to tarnish that to the any degree.",
