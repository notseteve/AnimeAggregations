  "description" : "Lisianthus is the only daughter of Eustoma and Cineraria, making her actually half-god, half-devil, but she only inherited the god racial characteristics of her father. Through Cineraria, she is Forbesii`s niece and Nerine`s cousin. She is also the non-biological daughter of Iris and Liliac, as Eustoma practices polygamy. Despite her fondness for her father, Lisianthus has a habit of hitting him with a folding chair, in a fashion similar to the WWF, if he embarrasses her in front of her friends.",
