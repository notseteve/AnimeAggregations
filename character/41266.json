  "description" : "The `hero` of 100 years ago and the one who `defeated` Glen Baskerville. He has some sort of connection with Alice`s memories. Jack looks like a grown-up Oz with a long plait. His personality is also similar; Like Oz, he does things at his own pace and is loud and cheerful. Oz and Gilbert meet him when they are taken to the Cheshire Cat`s dimension. He is currently residing in Oz`s body and can `possess` Oz and speak through him. When in control, Jack also has full control of Alice`s chain power. Jack was the third son of the Vessalius family who was, before the Tragedy of Sabrie, a third-rate noble family. Thus, with no expectations from his family, he acted quite freely: always smiling, joking and flirting with girls. Jack was also a self-proclaimed music box maker. His best friend at that time was Glen Baskerville. Jack crafted a pocket watch for him and Glen wrote the melody, titled \"Lacie\". The pocket watch`s melody was said to be a song that Lacie always sang to herself. Later, Glen tried to kill Jack because he started the Tragedy of Sablier (because he believed that without Lacie, there was no meaning to life) Although hailed as a hero for this act, Jack did not want to kill his best friend.\nSource: Wikipedia",
