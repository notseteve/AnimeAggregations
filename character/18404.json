  "description" : "Maylene is a clumsy maid whose cracked glasses do nothing to improve her clumsiness. However, she refuses to purchase a new pair as they are the first thing Ciel bought for her. Sebastian believes her main problem is her intelligence and not her poor eyesight. She has a crush on Sebastian as blushes when ever she is in his presence and is even clumsier when Sebastian is watching. In the anime she fantasizes about being close to him in episode 1. She is rather superstitious but admits to having a soft spot for scary stories. Maylene used to be a sniper who did not use a scope, due to her sharp far-sighted vision caused by her ill-fitting glasses. She is also physically fit as she can use a sniper rifle like a hand gun and keeps hundreds loaded at once to decrease reload time. At the anime`s conclusion, it is unknown whether she is alive or dead, although it is noted she was breathing before she collapsed.",
