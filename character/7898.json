  "description" : "Filia Ul Copt is a golden dragon, formerly serving as a priestess under Flarelord Vrabazard.\nBeing a dragon, Filia has two bodies- her original golden dragon form, and the form we see most often, the young human woman. She can transform between these at will, but she does not enjoy transforming to dragon in front of other people, as it requires her to shed all her clothing in the process. Her dragon form is extremely large, and when she is in human form, she maintains her original weight, physical strength and her tail, which pops out when she becomes angry or startled. She says this is because she has yet to perfect her transformations. Even in human form, Filia retains her dragon magic and skills, such as holy spells and the ability to teleport herself and others over fairly long distances. She also carries a large mace on a garter belt attached to her leg.",
