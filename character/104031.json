  "description" : "Kyougai is a demon and former member of the http://anidb.net/ch104027 [Twelve Demon Moons]. He was stripped of his number by http://anidb.net/ch104020 [Muzan] due to slowly losing the ability to eat humans and reaching his \"limit\". Because of this, he obsessively tries to earn his spot back in the Twelve Demon Moons, attacking and eating humans who pass by the Drum House. He fights using the drums embedded into his body; striking them would move things forward and backward and changes rooms throughout the house.",
