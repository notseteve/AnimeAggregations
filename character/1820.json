  "description" : "Grand Zamboa is the mecha piloted by the Anti-Spiral.\nCreated to fight the newly formed Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann on even grounds, beat Team Dai-Gurren at its own game and put an end to the fight once and for all. Its styling is similar to the Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, with the Anti-Spiral home world as its core on its forehead and an extra pair of arms, located on its shoulders, which it used to catch the galaxies as well as execute its Infinity Big-Bang Storm attack, crushing to two galaxies together to produce a blast equal to a Big Bang to instantly vaporise the target. Though the attack was intended to annihilate Team Dai-Gurren, the manoeuvre backfired when Lordgenome used the Lazengann to take the blast, converting it and himself into Spiral Energy for the Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann. It was ultimately destroyed when Simon and Nia managed to pierce its pilot`s body with the Lagann`s drill, using the Lagann Impact.\nNotably, the Grand Zamboa`s arms were in fact able to transform into drills, normally a symbol of Spiral Beings - however, when they are shown stationary, the drills in fact have entirely straight lines from base to tip.",
