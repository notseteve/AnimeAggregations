  "description" : "Born on Mars and orphaned after his parents died in an apparent military coup, his dream to become a cook stemmed from the quality of the raw food available on the planet. Though he has a nanomachine controller enabling him to pilot machinery, he refuses to become a military pilot; his first time in an Aestevalis was an accident, though he quickly showed capable piloting skill; because of the lack of pilots on the ship, he was officially made one for the duration of the tour. A Gekiganger fan as a child, his devotion to the series is rekindled by fellow pilot Gai Daigoji. He is romantically adored by just about all the girls aboard the Nadesico especially the ship`s captain Yurika Misumaru, who was also a childhood friend, but is usually terrified of her over-amorous advances to him.",
