  "description" : "Sekihara Tae is the 20-something manager of the beef hot pot (gyuunabe, or sukiyaki) restaurant, the Akabeko. She has a twin sister named Sae managing in a similar restaurant called the Shirobeko in Kyoto. Sagara Sanosuke also owes her a seemingly large sum of money in which interest is accounted for. In the anime, and a bit in the manga, she has also tried to push the relationship between Himura Kenshin and Kamiya Kaoru since it seemed it to her that it was not working.\nWatsuki originally created Tae as a plot convience in the Zanza story arc and he intended for Kaoru to patronize a restaurant operated by \"a good friend\"; the author said he used \"no thought\" while creating Tae, including a lack of planning in her character design. Tae`s personality originates from Kamiya Megumi in Watsuki`s first \"Rurouni\" story. As the story progressed Watsuki found himself adding additional details about Tae, such as her family name, her status as the daughter of the owner of Akabeko, and her collecting of Nishiki paintings. Watsuki said that Tae was his first character to evolve in the manner that she did. Watsuki did not give Tae lipstick so she would be easily distinguished against Megumi. Her character design originates from a rejected model for Kenshin with a prototype Kenshin hairstyle colored black and a \"softer, female\" face. Watsuki originally intended for Tae to have a Kansai dialect and had an assistant from the Kansai region to vet the dialog, but Watsuki ultimately rejected the idea after he felt the concept was becoming too strange.\nSource: wiki",
