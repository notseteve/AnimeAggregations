  "description" : "One of the oldest and most seasoned veteran warriors of a tribe of forest elves, Alleyne is taciturn and blunt in her dealings with others. She`s had a long relationship with Echidna, who she often chastises for her loose ways but is mocked in return for her inexperience with men. The appearance of the half-elf Nowa in the forest elf community marked a turning point for Alleyne, who appointed her \"guardian of the forest\". The elf village elders did not approve however, and drove her from the village with the excuse that she must join the Queen`s Blade tournament. Distraught, Alleyne secretly set out for the tournament as well, to protect the girl whose sudden appearance had awoken feelings long dormant in the veteran elven warrior.",
