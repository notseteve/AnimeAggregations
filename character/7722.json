  "description" : "Many, many years ago, so long ago that no one knows just how long ago it was (presumably at the world`s genesis), Ruby Eye and the shinzoku of his world, Flare Dragon Ceifeed, began a massive battle for control of the world. As a mazoku, Ruby Eye`s goal was to completely destroy the world, while Flare Dragon wanted to protect it from destruction. The length of this battle is unknown, but the conclusion was reached approximately around 4000 BK. Before his destruction at the hands of Ruby Eye, Flare Dragon created four alter-egos of himself, then broke Ruby Eye into seven parts and scattered them throughout the world, sealed in humans. Flare Dragon`s reasoning for sealing Ruby Eye in humans was that since humans have such short lives compared to those of other races, Ruby Eye would eventually be purged through reincarnation before re-awakening. Unfortunately for Flare Dragon, this hypothesis was more or less incorrect. If a human carrying a piece of Ruby Eye develops a great hatred of the world, the piece could awaken and combine with the human to become a special kind of a half-demon; this already happened a couple of times and the pieces are still far from being purified.",
