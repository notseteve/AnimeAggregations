  "description" : "A female imperial guard of the Kuhouin family, Lin is the newest bodyguard of Murasaki, replacing her former guard, Kiba, due to female convenience. Armed with a pair of katana, her fighting skills are formidable, though not at the level of Yayoi Inuzuka. Although she disapproves of Shinkurou, nevertheless, she accepts him as Murasaki`s companion, and frowns heavily on all the attention Shinkurou receives from other girls (even if he is unaware of it). Lin takes Murasaki`s wishes literally, including attempting to get Shinkurou and Murasaki wedded to each other, despite not having permission from either party (or their families, for that matter). Under Murasaki`s care, Lin is slowly learning about normal life, albeit with some difficulty.",
