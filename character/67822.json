  "description" : "Kokonose Haruka was the human form of http://anidb.net/ch63168 [Konoha]. As a human, he had weak body and was constantly hospitalized, even though he had high academics, being in normal classes was a harbor to him, therefore he was put in a separate class with http://anidb.net/ch67821 [Enemoto Takane].\nHe died due to unknown reasons after loosing consciousness in the classroom. Whe he wakes up in hospital he is dragged into Void Space (Heat Haze), where he revealed his true desires of having a normal body. He switched bodies with one of his favorite illustrations, turning him to a superpower being but he lost his memory on the go.\nAs Konoha, he seems to have no memory of the past and his human form, unlike Takane, who is fully aware of her past and her situations.\nIt`s hinted that Tateyama was involved in his death, as well as Takane`s.\nHaruka harbors feelings towards Takane, also not exactly hinted as love, his last words as a living human was yearning to see her again.\nHis songs are: \"Yukei Yesterday\" (Yesterday Evening), which is a story about him and Takane and his feelings toward her, and \"Summertime Record\" which is narrated by him at the end of the series.",
