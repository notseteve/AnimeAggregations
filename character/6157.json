  "description" : "Misumi Nagisa is the ace of her school`s lacrosse team. Her alter ego Cure Black is the strong fighter of the Pretty Cure duo. She is quite girly, image conscious, and has a large collection of stuffed animals. Nagisa is weak in academics but makes up for it with pure spirit and energy. She also has a large appetite and loves to eat chocolate and, according to Honoka, foods with the word \"yaki\" in the name. She likes shopping but tends to squander her money and ends up having none when she needs it most. Nagisa has a crush on Honoka`s friend, Fujimura-senpai, also known as Fuji-pi, gets flustered whenever he is around. To her dismay, Nagisa is more popular with the girls than the boys. She has a younger brother, Ryouta, who seems to be very fond of Honoka. Aside from Honoka, Nagisa`s best friends are Shiho and Rina.",
