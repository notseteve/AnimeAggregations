  "description" : "The remarkable Emi and http://anidb.net/ch7040 [Yumi] Hanner are young girls who first meet http://anidb.net/ch7033 [Tylor] while they are taking care of their father, Admiral http://anidb.net/ch38780 [Robert J. Hanner] (retired). After they are taken hostage, Emi and Yumi are rescued by Tylor and fall in love with him. They join the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]`s crew when Tylor is reassigned as its captain.\nDesired to pilot ships, they persuade http://anidb.net/ch7042 [Kojirou] to train them (against his will of course) and discover that they have a natural piloting ability. Emi and Yumi`s close quarters with Kojirou provide them with endless amusement since he is deathly afraid of females.\nIdentical twins, the only way to tell them apart is by their pony tails (Yumi`s is on the left side of her head, while Emi`s is on her right) and their voices (Yumi`s is higher pitched than Emi`s). They were also childhood friends of http://anidb.net/ch7033 [Yuriko Star].",
