  "description" : "Due to the Bronze Saints` crime against Sanctuary (participating in the Galaxian Wars), the Pope of Sanctuary issued the order to kill the young Saints. Mozes was one of the Silver Saints sent to deal with them, but due to Aries Mu`s intervention, he killed the Black Dragon instead. Thinking they completed their mission, they retreated, but returned due to Misty and Babel`s delay. Being accompanied by Hound Asterion, who could read minds, Mozes soon turned on Eagle Marin. After subduing her, they tied her upside down to a pole in the sea, to use her as bait for Pegasus Seiya. The plan failed, and Seiya engaged Mozes in combat. After a bloody battle, Seiya sprouted wings from his Cosmo, and Mozes was defeated.\nSource: Wikipedia",
