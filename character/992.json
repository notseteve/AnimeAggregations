  "description" : "Spoink leads a bizarre, fragile existence. It moves around by bouncing on its tail. However, Spoink`s bouncing has an additional, far more vital role. The small shock generated by Spoink`s impact with the ground every time it bounces courses through its body and causes its heart to pump. Essentially, Spoink`s heart is jumpstarted every time it beats. If Spoink ever stopped bouncing, its heart would stop and it would die. Thus, Spoink constantly bounces up and down, even while sleeping.\nSpoink exhibits its psychic powers best by focusing them through an object, which also serves to amplify them. This object is the pearl that a Clamperl makes once in its lifetime. The pearl size is also the amount of power the Spoink has. That is why it`s always looking for bigger pearls, it wants more power! The anime suggests that prolonged separation of Spoink from its pearl will weaken Spoink greatly, even risking death.\nSpoink resembles a pig.",
