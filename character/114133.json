  "description" : "Ramsay Wartz was an Alliance flag officer who served as a squadron commander of 2,500 ships in 794 UC.\nAs a squadron commander, he valued the insights of his chief of staff, Malcolm Wideborn, immensely. The latter`s tactical advice however failed to be of any use against Reinhard von MÃ¼sel during a skirmish prior to the Sixth Battle of Iserlohn on 6 November 794 UC, and Reinhard`s squadron proceeded to demolish Wartz`s squadron, resulting in his death, and the destruction of 2,200 ships.\nSource: Gineipedia",
