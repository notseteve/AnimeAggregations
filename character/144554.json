  "description" : "Elena is an operative with the Turks unit of the Shinra Electric Power Company, led by http://anidb.net/character/144552 [Tseng]. Elena is a young woman with a slender physique, fair skin, brown eyes, and neck-length blonde hair styled in an inverted bob. She was recruited as http://anidb.net/character/25628 [Rude`s] temporary new partner after http://anidb.net/character/582 [Reno] was injured during the Sector 7 job. Elena is enthusiastic and hard-working, but is careless and lacks a filter. She admires and respects Tseng, whom she has a crush on.\nElena is a newer member of the Turks, lacking experience but compensating with her proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and firearms.\nSource: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Elena",
