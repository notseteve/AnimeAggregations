  "description" : "Chloe`s Eevee is the first Pok√©mon Chloe ever caught. It was being studied at the Eevee Evolution Lab in Vermilion City by Pinery and her team when it befriended Professor Cerise`s Yamper and Chloe. They had been trying to get it to evolve for days but it just wouldn`t evolve. Pinery explained to Chloe that all Eevee`s possess unstable DNA, so it just may be this Eevee`s DNA is a little bit more unstable than usual or perhaps it hasn`t found its true path just yet, and is feeling a little lost.",
