  "description" : "The main protagonist of the series. In the first episode, she tells her best friend Mitsue that overnight she has become a goddess; this is never further explained. She is remarkably naive and simple-minded but always has the best intentions. She has had a crush on Ninomiya Kenji for a long time, and gets very nervous and red-faced around him. Whenever she performs magic, her hair grows very long and she often falls asleep afterwards, due to the effort involved.",
