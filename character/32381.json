  "description" : "Ikusabe Genji has an extreme thirst to fight Homunculi, and is the record-keeper of `Most Homunculi killed` (332), even more than the number of homunculi killed by Hiwatari and Bravo combined. Ikusabe`s powers come from his Buso Renkin, the Jumonji spear Gekisen`s recovery ability, his special ability and habit to eat remains of Homunculi he`s killed to increase his power and stamina, and the times he can use the recovery ability. Unlike Negoro, Ikusabe cares more about the process of battling than claiming victory, and quit the mission to kill Kazuki when he was defeated by Papillon. In the anime, it is not shown that he eats homunculi, nor does he send Papillon to Kazuki and Gouta. Instead, he falls to the ground after Papillon defeats him.",
