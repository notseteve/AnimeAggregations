  "description" : "James is a house butler for Lillie family in the Alola region. He ordinarily doesn`t allow Pokémon to enter the house but made an exception as Lillie approved Pikachu and Rotom Pokédex when Ash visited the house for the first time.\nHe battled against Ash outside the house and he is one of the most skilled battlers that Lillie`s family has on staff. It had been a long time since he had such a fun battle. He defeated Ash`s Rowlet but the battle was cut-off when they heard Lillie scream.",
