  "description" : "Serperior, known as the Regal Pokémon, is the final evolution of Snivy. Unlike its pre-evolutions, Serperior has no legs anymore and has retained its short hands. Serperior is more snake-like than Snivy and Servine. It intimidates its foe by raising its head high and glaring them would make its enemies stun. If it faces a formidable enemy, Serperior tends to battle seriously. It increases it power by utilizing solar energy in its body. It uses powerful move by its tail.\nIn a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Serperior was voted as one of the best Pokémon from Black and White. Editor Thomas East stated that \"not many people would dispute that choosing Snivy as a Starter is all worth it in the end for its awesome final evolution.\".",
