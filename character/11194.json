  "description" : "Sawatari Karin is the younger sister of Izumi and Mitsuki. Unlike her two sisters, she stayed behind rather than run away. After learning of her sisters` whereabouts, she visits them occasionally, although Izumi discourages her in order to keep her away from Yoshitaka`s grasp after Yoshitaka becomes attracted to her when Karin is in the child`s maid costume. Karin is a typical 5 year old; sweet and innocent. She is oblivious to Yoshitaka`s perverted nature as well as the harassment that Izumi receives on a daily basis. Like Mitsuki, she loves alligators, especially Pochi. She believes that anyone who likes alligators can`t be bad. Yoshitaka tricks her into thinking he likes Pochi (when in fact they are often rivals) to make Karin like him.",
