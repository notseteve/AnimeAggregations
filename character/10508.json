  "description" : "Hayao Kakizaki is an U.N. Spacy japanese variable fighter pilot who was assigned to the Vermilion Squadron, along with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Maximilian Jenius], to be under the command of http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]. He pilots a brown-white http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie] in the television series and in http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?] movie he pilots a green-striped http://anidb.net/ch48787 [VF-1A Valkyrie]. Among the pilots of the Vermillion Squadron, Kakizaki is the least serious and skilled. His characterization adds to an already heavy laden humorous anime even more comic relief. He is portrayed also as being a laid back character, which often at times would endanger him while out battling the Zentradi. Compared to his teammates, Kakizaki is also the least experienced pilot, and from time-to-time, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] and http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] had to save him from being killed.On November 2009, when Gunsight One`s radar system was damaged, Kakizaki, along with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and his superior, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] accompanied http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] to scout the surrounding of the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. During this mission, he and the others were captured by the Zentradi. This marks the first contact between the races.\nIn episode 19: Burst Point, Kakizaki was killed in action when the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross]`s barrier system overloads and Kakizaki`s Valkyrie was caught in the blast field. In the Macross chronology, he was KIA just after the episode of http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]`s death. However, in http://anidb.net/a996 [The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?] movie, he was killed in battle by missiles fired by a group of Queadluun-Raus led by http://anidb.net/ch10517 [Milia Fallyna] while joking with http://anidb.net/ch10506 [Max] and http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] (Ironically underestimating their enemy`s strength due to them being female).Source: wiki",
