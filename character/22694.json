  "description" : "Gulzar claims he is the best Grass-Type Pokémon trainer in the Orange Islands. He ended up challenging Ash to a battle and used his Gloom. Ash responded by wanting to use his Charizard but actually used his Squirtle by mistake. Gloom was highly resistant to Squirtle`s Water Gun attack and forced Ash to switch Pokémon. Once again Ash wanted to choose Charizard but sent out Snorlax by accident.\nGloom used solarbeam on the sleeping Snorlax but only managed to wake it up. Ash`s Snorlax tried to eat his Gloom, actually ate the flowers he kept in his headband and ate his lunch. Gulzar withdrew Gloom and then ran away.",
