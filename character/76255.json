It evolved in a battle against Ash where it also learned Leaf Blade.\nDespite evolving, learning a new move and becoming stronger, it couldn`t overcome the EXP that Ash`s Frogadier had and was quickly knocked out with a blast from Water Pulse. Sawyer vowed to Juptile that they should become stronger. Sawyer`s Grovyle became Ash`s Frogadier rival after that battle as the two locked eyes in anticipation of their rematch battle.",
