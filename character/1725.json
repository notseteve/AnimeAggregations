  "description" : "Polnareff is the stereotypical \"good natured klutz\": he is heroic and protective of those he loves, but is not very bright (although he has shown lots of cunning and strategy throughout the series). He is very impulsive and loud, and is quick to jump into action without considering the risk, character traits that have landed him in lots of trouble. However, he is sincerely dedicated to doing good, and is a good man to watch your back. He also fancies himself as a ladies man, but this is probably him overestimating his actual prowess (he probably has horrible luck with the ladies).\nOut of all the characters in the series, Polnareff is the one that has the least problems showing his feelings, and he adds a lot of humour and warmth to what would otherwise be a pretty cold team (Kakyoin and Jotaro in particular are very cold characters). Indeed, while he may sometimes be seen as the comic relief of the series, Polnareff`s companions appreciate his good nature and trust him to help them win when a tough battle arrives.",
