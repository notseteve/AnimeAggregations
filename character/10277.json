  "description" : "Tomekichi is `the traveling cat`, a two-tailed nekomata (a feline spirit-being capable of walking upright and speech, said to grow to about the size of a dog) who is traveling around to search for missing statues. The kindly feline is doing so in honor of a priest who once took care of it, even though the priest is now presumably deceased. Even though his main duty is to search for missing statues, he is also seen taking various jobs, such as being a referee for a medium`s tournament. Tomekichi apparently holds considerable esteem among his own people; on one occasion, he lead several other felines in the performing of a barrier spell-chant, which was cast in his name.",
