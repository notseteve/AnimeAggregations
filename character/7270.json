  "description" : "Yagami Ibuki develops a crush on Yuusaku, when he briefly acts as a student-teacher in the high school she is attending. Ibuki was at first unimpressed with him but later develops a crush after misinterpreting him as a sort of tragic romantic hero.\nIbuki tends to hatch devious plots that put her together with Yuusaku, usually putting him into a compromising situation. Yuusaku is not interested in her, but is a pushover about it as always, and Ibuki refuses to be denied.\nSource: wiki",
