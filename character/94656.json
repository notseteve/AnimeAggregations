He is an extremely light-hearted individual that almost always has a grin on his face.\nTory has a great interest in magic, particularly the natural magic produced by a mage as he finds it beautiful. His obsession bleeds over to the actual practitioners, wishing that he could have met http://anidb.net/ch91215 [Cartaphilus] and excitedly grabbing http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise]`s face upon meeting her as she`s a Sleigh Beggy.\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki",
