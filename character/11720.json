  "description" : "Lucy Heartfilia is the main female protagonist and viewpoint character of Fairy Tail.\nAccording to http://anidb.net/cr7578 [Mashima Hiro], her given name was inspired by The Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nShe is a 17-year-old wizard who specializes in summoning celestial spirits from another realm using a set of keys called Gatekeys, and treats them like her friends. She also carries a whip as her personal weapon, which she wields on occasion to fight alongside her spirits.\nAs one of the saner members of the guild, Lucy regularly gawks at the odd habits of her guildmates, who frequently show up uninvited inside her house.\nSource: wikipedia",
