  "description" : "Nozomi`s little brother Junpei is also a member of the Fuji-Daiichi Middle School Football Club. Unlike Tetsuji and Kaoru, who maintain a certain kindness towards the young lady and applaud her talent, Junpei is more teasing towards his sister. Younger than her, he nevertheless remains particularly good thanks to the energy he deploys on the pitch, so much so that he plays like an asset in his team.",
