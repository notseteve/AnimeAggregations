  "description" : "The Darklore faction (color: yellow; in the anime sometimes written as ダークネス = \"Darkness\") consists of demi-humans and monsters. Under these are the werewolves and other were-creatures, as well as non-humans such as faeries, mermaids and (possibly) elves. Theoretically, they may be the oldest faction among the five, hinting at a pre-human background, but this is still to be confirmed.\nAn extremely varied faction, Darklore is a conglomeration of ancient, forgotten races. Elves, lycanthropes (were-creatures), demons, mermaids, vampires, oni, fairies, even undead. Almost every beast or creature recounted in tales and myths can draw their origin from Darklore sightings. Obviously, only the more human members of Darklore (such as lycanthropes, which change from beast to human at will) can assimilate with human society. Everything but angels and dragons can be lumped under Darklore. Some ancient gods including Ba`al are included as Darklore.\nTypical skills vary widely, depending on race and disposition, but there`s a lot of magical power to be found here, usually magic inherent to a given species.\nThe creatures of the Darklore faction want the world that was once theirs back, basically to retake earth from what they see as the human taint. Their principal enemies are the http://anidb.net/ch40609 [WIZ-DOM] and http://anidb.net/ch40598 [Arayashiki], with whom they have fought for centuries.",
