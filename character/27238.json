  "description" : "Aloe`s Yorterry was revealed before her Gym battle with Ash. Iris quickly went up to it as she found it to be a very cute Pokémon. While Yorterry is a lovable Pokémon, it showed in battle that it`s cuteness shouldn`t mistaken or underestimated when it comes to battling. Aloe`s Herderrier is a completely different Pokémon all together from Aloe`s Yorterry and not the evolved form of this Pokémon.\nAloe`s Yorterry`s Roar was very effective in causing Ash`s Tepig to be switched with Ash`s Oshawott in the first gym battle against Aloe. When Ash`s Tepig and Aloe`s Yorterry were matched up at the end of the gym battle, Aloe`s Yorterry Take Down proved to be a very strong move as it knocked out Ash`s Tepig and gave Aloe the match victory.",
