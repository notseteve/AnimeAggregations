  "description" : "One of three girls, seen only in silhouette, who spend about thirty seconds per episode energetically commentating on its events in symbolic allegory. Their antics provide both comic relief and insight into the show`s plot. While they function much like a Greek chorus, their primary influence is shadow puppetry.\nIn episode 34, it is suggested that they are members of the school`s drama club as well. In that episode, A-Ko and B-Ko act out a version of the story behind the series, suggesting that they may know about the nature of Akio and Anthy and their reason for the duels.",
