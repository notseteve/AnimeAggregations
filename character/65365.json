  "description" : "The old man from Kalos lives with his wife. He won the tournament at the Village Festival. His wife had been battling with him for a long time but the day before Clemont and his friends met him, the two of them had got into an argument and neither wanted to apologize.\nWanting to knock her husband down a peg, she agreed to battle him with her secret weapon, Clemont`s Chespin in a Pokémon battle. The old man agreed but with the stipulation that she would forgive him for what he said the day before. Clemont`s Chespin was too fat to battle though as it had been eating too many macarons. Clemont ended up intervening and got it to roll to reduce its belly fat. The match had to be called as the old man`s back gave out as he was trying to command Mafoxy to use Mystical Fire.\nThe old man returned to his house and had bought his wife a cake as make-up gift. He had planned to apologize, no matter if he won or lost the Pokémon battle between them.",
