  "description" : "The return of Zeon remnants aboard the asteroid base Axis to the Earth Sphere in the last weeks of the Gryps Conflict results in an even more turbulent political climate, and Anaheim Electronics - one of the AEUG`s primary supporters - is forced to provide mobile suit technology to the Axis (and later Neo Zeon) forces. One Anaheim mobile suit design to fall into Neo Zeon`s hands is the RMS-099B Schuzrum Dias, an improvement over the well-proven RMS-099 Rick Dias used by the AEUG. The only changes to the basic mobile suit itself are a larger rear skirt armor piece and a flared-out armor piece on the head to provide extra protection for the monoeye sensors. However, the most noticeable change seen on the Schuzrum Dias is the replacement of the old random binder backpack propellant tanks with two large grye binders, which mount extra thrusters and verniers, an even greater fuel capacity for extended flight time and beam cannons for additional firepower. These features make the Schuzrum Dias an even more well-performing unit over the tried-and-true Rick Dias, and the supply of these mobile suits to Haman Karn`s Neo Zeon forces is the start of another trend of \"playing both sides against the middle.\" Anaheim, always out to make a profit no matter who`s winning or losing, develops and sells new mobile suits to both Federation and Zeon forces for several years to come.\nSource: mahq.net",
