  "description" : "The Forbidden Gundam is one of three new Earth Alliance prototypes deployed in the invasion of the Orb Union. Based on an X200-series frame like that of the Blitz Gundam, this machine features several unique weapons systems. Its Trans-Phase Armor and energy-deflecting Geschmeidig Panzer shields protect the Forbidden from both physical attacks and beam weapons, and by generating a magnetic field between its railguns, the Forbidden can bend the beams of its plasma cannon to make them harder to evade. It also carries a heavy scythe capable of slicing an enemy warship in half. In the hands of the biological CPU Shani Andras, this machine is as unpredictable as it is dangerous.",
