  "description" : "Suyama Shouji acts as the shortstop and third baseman of the team. A level-headed character, he is generally quieter and less rambunctious than his teammates, although he once reacts strongly to Momoe`s offer of a particular brand of protein powder to which he harbors a strong dislike. It`s revealed that Suyama doesn`t share many of the boyish qualities the other Nishiura boys seem to have, such as fantasizing girls, emphasizing his more mature personality. In the series, he is closest to Sakaeguchi.",
