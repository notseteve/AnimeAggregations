  "description" : "Kanna is the first detachment of Naraku. She appears to be a ten-year-old girl with white hair and clothing. As a \"concealed incarnation\" of Naraku, Kanna has no scent and no demonic aura, making her undetectable to InuYasha`s senses and immune to demonic aura-related effects such as the Hakurei-zan barrier. Kanna is the only incarnation that Naraku trusts with important information about his actions, allowing her to give orders in his place.\nKanna carries a demonic mirror that can steal the souls of those reflected in it. Once a soul is trapped by her mirror, Kanna can control that person`s body to carry out her bidding. However, the mirror can be overwhelmed by an especially powerful soul such as Kagome`s, forcing Kanna to release all of the trapped souls before the glass shatters. The mirror can also create a glass demon to copy the abilities of whatever it reflects, though Kanna herself suffers damage when the glass demon is wounded.",
