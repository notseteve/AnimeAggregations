  "description" : "Rebecca`s Shuckle is the Pokémon that Zoey`s Glameow faced off against in the final battle of the Mecabbage Town Pokémon Contest. Zoey`s Glameow proved to be a fast opponent for it, as it dodged effectively Shuckle`s Constrict attack. However, its powerful defenses gave Glameow a hard time, as its Fury Swipes couldn`t damage it at all when it was hiding inside its shell. Eventually, after Shuckle`s defenses were penetrated by its opponent`s Shadow Claw, it was knocked out by Glameow`s Iron Tail attack, which earned Zoey the victory and her fifth ribbon.",
