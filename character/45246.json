  "description" : "The pinnacle of Zeon Newtype-use mobile weapon technology at its time, the NZ-000 Queen Mansa is considered one of the most powerful mobile weapons ever constructed. Designed and constructed by Neo Zeon`s Glemy Toto faction during the First Neo Zeon War, the Queen Mansa combines the best features of the successful AMX-004 Qubeley series and the Titans` MRX-010 Psyco Gundam Mark II into one design. This massive mobile suit is armed with wide variety of beam weapons, and carries 30 psycommu-controlled funnels in a large tail binder. The massive binders on its shoulders house a variant of the I-field barrier concept called a mega particle deflection system, which not only absorbs or deflects incoming beam weapons fire like a standard I-field, but can also redirect that beam fire back at the foe that fired it. Like the AMX-004-3 Qubeley Mark II, the Queen Mansa can be controlled externally via a psycommu controller headset worn by the pilot, and like the Psyco Gundam Mark II (and even the old Principality of Zeon`s MSN-02 Zeong), the Queen Mansa`s head can detach and operate independently if the main body is heavily damaged and destroyed.\nSource: mahq.net",
