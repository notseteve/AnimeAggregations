  "description" : "Hien is Sakuya`s brother, and Genjimaru`s grandson. He pilots a blue Avu-Kamuu armed with a massive blade. He is often the level headed one between him and Hauenkua. He also advocated that the Emperor/Empress should unite the nations through peace. In the game, he advocates starting global war and destroying all enemy villagers just like Hauenkua, except unlike Hauenkua, he believes that he is doing it for a good cause. When Dii reveals himself, Hien willingly joined him. He was killed when Witsuarunemitea punched a hole through the chest (and the cockpit) of the Avu-Kamuu.",
