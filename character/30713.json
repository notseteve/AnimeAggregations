He appears to be more confident than either Ginger or Nicky, fighting someone one-on-one at Garlic Jr.`s castle rather than going two-on-one, and he doesn`t seem to make swords like his comrades can.\nBy shouting \"Pepperoni\" or \"Cheese\" or \"Unaju\" (depending on the language and dub) he gets muscular, and his power and speed increase.",
