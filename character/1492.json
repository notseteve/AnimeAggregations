  "description" : "The Gurren, originally named the \"Gunzar\" as mentioned by other Beastmen in the manga, is initially an above-average sized Beastmen-piloted mecha, which attacked Litner Village the morning after Team Gurren`s arrival early in the series. The mech is subsequently captured, rebuilt, stylised and named by its eventual pilot, Kamina, who had the Gurren`s original swords converted into massive sunglasses similar to his own that could be used as a blade or boomerang in combat. Being of typical Gunmen proportions, the Gurren is capable to fight without the Lagann`s power. While its individual power was initially not on the same level as advanced Gunmen/pilot pairs, such as Viral and his Enki, Kamina eventually became experienced enough to hold his own against multiple enemies.\nAfter Kamina`s death, the Gurren was mainly piloted by Rossiu and one-time pilots until the aftermath of the battle of Tepplin, pilotless until Viral becomes the Gurren`s offical pilot during the battle against the AntiSpirals. Gurren (紅蓮) means \"Crimson Lotus\". As a homage to it, a white Gunzar unit is seen during the battle of Tepplin, sporting a pair of pistols rather than blades.",
