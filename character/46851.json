  "description" : "Bashou is one of Neon Nostrade`s new bodyguards, hired along with Kurapika. When he is first introduced he is quick to underestimate Kurapika, but after Kurapika`s display of his `Dowsing Chain`, he grows respect for him. His nen ability is called \"Great Haiku: The Wandering Haiku Poet\", wherein Basho writes a haiku describing a condition on a piece of paper (such as \"Anything I hit will explode\"), which then comes true, but only if the haiku is good.\nSource: Wiki",
