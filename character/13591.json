  "description" : "(From Shakespeare`s Twelfth Night) - GOTT ES Member (C Class), apparent age 9, partner to Cesario. Special ability: \"Calamity\".\nThe youngest member of the ES Force, Viola is one of the more precocious members. She also seems to be the main voice of her partnership with Cesario. She often gives the other ES Members nicknames. Viola is also a \"C Class\" member and, although Eclair and Lumiere are actually G-class, can prove to be a powerful adversity to Eclair and Lumiere. Her power \"Calamity\", which allows her to disperse matter at the molecular level, requires a great deal of energy which is supplied by Cesario`s ability so can only be used when she is in physical contact with him. Viola is also often seen with a cute stuffed animal named Dragon Papi. She enjoys Italian food and argues with Cesario about where to eat.",
