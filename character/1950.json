  "description" : "Toono Shiki (遠野四季) is http://anidb.net/ch1948 [Michael Roa Valdamjong]`s 18th host and brother of http://anidb.net/ch1942 [Toono Akiha] by birth. He is not to be confused with http://anidb.net/ch1940 [Toono Shiki] (遠野志貴, formerly Nanaya Shiki), the protagonist of http://anidb.net/a1015 [Tsukihime], who was adopted away from the Nanaya clan. For purposes of distinction, the one who was born Toono Shiki (Roa`s current host) is normally referred to as \"SHIKI.\" Toono SHIKI was good friends with his adoptive brother Shiki.\nSHIKI eventually lost to his demonic blood and went berserk, attacking Akiha and nearly killing Shiki when he went to her defense. His father, http://anidb.net/ch56170 [Toono Makihisa], forced him to the brink of death and kept him locked up. Shiki`s wounds nearly killed him, so Akiha gave him half her life to keep him alive, but, not being completely dead himself, SHIKI used the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception (which are not \"true\" MEoDP and are vastly different from Toono Shiki or http://anidb.net/ch1297 [Ryougi Shiki]`s respective versions of that ability) that he gained from nearly dying to steal half of the borrowed life from Shiki. As a result of these events, a connection was established between Shiki and SHIKI, with each possessing a fourth of a life and Akiha keeping the other half.",
