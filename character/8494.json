  "description" : "A tuned-up, improved prototype of the Enact for the PMC`s Ali Al-Saachez. The blade rifle appears from the tip of the large sonic blade. Increasing the amount of fixed armaments, the sonic blade is built into the arm.\nThis Mobile Suit can dock in a Mobile Armor called Agrissa, an old model used in the 5th Solar Wars, but was destroyed by Gundam Drei.\nThis unit has a slight modification to its fuselage to allow it to operate the plasma field of the Agrissa. Along with the modification it was repainted to match the color scheme from blue to red.\nThis unit was later abandoned by Ali after he stole the Gundam Throne Zwei.",
