  "description" : "Oboro was in the beginning an impulsive and somewhat egotistical bandit chief of a village near the one which Hakuoro dwells in. Overpowering these traits, however, is his care for his younger sister, Yuzuha, to whom he would bring Tusukuru to oversee her health. When Hakuoro becomes the leader of the country`s rebellion, Oboro joins forces with Hakuoro and swears eternal allegiance, with revenge for Tusukuru among his reasons, calling Hakuoro his brother.",
