  "description" : "Rinto`s Gallade watched the battle between Ash`s Farfetch`d and Dozer`s Gurdurr at the Rock Tunnel in the Kanto region. Rinto challenged Ash`s Farfetch`d to a battle right after it had defeated Dozer`s Gurdurr and his Gallade knocked it out with one attack. Gallade was able to avoid all of Ash`s Farfetch`d`s attacks.\nDuring the rematch battle between Ash`s Farfetch`d, Gallade let its guard down near the end of the battle to activate its Justified Ability. By taking damage from a Dark-type move like Ash`s Farfetch`d`s Night Slash, Gallade revealed a strong sense of justice and increases its attack power. It wasn`t enough to defeat Ash`s Sirfetch`d which had just evolved.",
