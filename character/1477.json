  "description" : "A talented military officer of the UEAF, Jun is a stickler for rules and regulations, as well as stating the obvious, he is the executive officer aboard the Nadesico. He can often be found beside the beautiful and bubbly Captain Yurika Misumaru, whom he has had a serious crush on for years when her family moved from Mars to Earth ten years prior to the Jovian War. In fact, he cares about Yurika so much that he practically gave up his military career so that he could serve aboard the Nadesico with her. Of course his love goes unnoticed by the oblivious Captain.",
