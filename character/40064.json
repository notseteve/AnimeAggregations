  "description" : "The Templar Order is a military order of the Chantry that, amongst their duties, hunts apostates and maleficars and watches over the mages from the Circle of Magi. While they are officially deemed a force of defenders by the Chantry, established to protect the communities of the faithful from magical threats, they are in fact an army unto themselves; well-equipped, highly disciplined and devoted to the destruction of non-believers in the name of the Maker.",
