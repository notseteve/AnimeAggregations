  "description" : "Lillia is a girl that resides in the Kalos region that is searching for a partner. She met Clemont one day and was quite fascinated by him. She was particularly interested in his Eipam Arm and commented that it was a fine device. Her father is the president of Orange Logo, the leading robot manufacturer in the industry. Whoever she marries will become the president of that company.\nBonnie initially asked Lillia to marry her brother Clemont and when Lillia didn`t brush off the remark like most girls did and actually began to consider the proposal, Bonnie got a bit concerned and started imagining all the scenarios that would occur as a result of them getting married.\nAfter an encounter with Team Rocket in which Clemont had to save his sister Bonnie with his Eipam Arm before she fell to her doom, Lillia realized that, as someone who`s looking for a partner, she needed to improve herself a lot more and that it seemed to her like she was still lacking appeal. She decided not to travel with Clemont and the other to the nearby Pok√©mon Center and parted ways.",
