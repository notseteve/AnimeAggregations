  "description" : "Keitarou`s adopted younger sister. Kanako is a master of disguise and is able to impersonate anyone, which she uses to try to get control over the Hinata Inn. Keitarou is the only one who can see through her disguise at simple view. Kanako never came to see Keitarou as a brother, and had loved him since they were children. When they promised to run an inn together when they grew up, she had assumed it would be as husband and wife. However, Keitarou does not share these thoughts and only sees her as a sister.",
