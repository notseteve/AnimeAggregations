  "description" : "After being defeated in battle by Suzaku Kururugi`s Lancelot Conquista, the Guren Mk-II receives an upgrade in mid-battle through a series of rocket mounted attachments.\nThis model most obvious change is the addition of a Float System, allowing it to fly, and a Radiant Wave Shielding system. The Float System attachment includes aesthetic changes to the head, adding antennae on the sides. It also gains a new \"armor-piercing bombardment-type\" Fukushahadou arm which matches the Knightmare`s color scheme, though the forearm is still predominantly silver. The new Fukushahadou arm can fire radiation blasts at long ranges or over wide areas while maintaining its close-range blast. Another addition to Guren`s arsenal is the Gefjun Net, a series of rocket-mounted drones launched from the back of the Guren that release a Gefjun Disturber surge. The Lancelot Conquista had countermeasures preventing complete shutdown when exposed to the Disturber, but even it is still slowed down by the surge.",
