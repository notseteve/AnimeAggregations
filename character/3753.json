  "description" : "The Octava Espada. He is an intellectual and the scientist of the Espada, thinking highly of himself and following his plans down to the finest detail. He is quite sadistic and views others as little more than research material. He thinks poorly of non-hollows, and hopes that Sousuke Aizen will someday eliminate all entities that aren`t hollows. Szayel has a variety of methods for analysing an opponent`s abilities, such as studying the damage done to their former opponents. Once doing so, Szayel can nullify the effects of their abilities, making him virtually immune to their attacks.",
