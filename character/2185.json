Brera seems to know how to play the first part of Ranka`s song \"Aimo\" using his harmonica, claiming that the song is the only fragment of his past he still has after memory modification. After saving Ranka from a wild beast attack, the injuries Brera sustained revealed that he is also a cyborg. He harbours a great deal of concern for Ranka`s well-being, but he doesn`t exactly know why.",
