  "description" : "Sinistea is a Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves into Polteageist when exposed to a Cracked Pot or a Chipped Pot. The item required depends on its form.\n- The Phony Form (if it lacks a mark of authenticity) requires a Cracked Pot to evolve.\n- The Antique Form (if it has a mark of authenticity) requires a Chipped Pot to evolve.\nSinistea is a small dark purple Pokémon that inhabits a teacup. The teacup itself is mainly sea-foam green with a lacy pattern that resembles a face. It has gold on the base and around the rim, which is chipped in a spot and part of the Pokémon`s liquid body is \"overflowing\". A small arm extends from another broken bit and holds onto where the handle would be, completing the look of the handle. A yellow swirl pattern can be seen from up above.\nAntique Form Sinistea has a mark of authenticity on the bottom of the cup. Phony Form Sinistea lacks this mark.\nSinistea are said to be created when a lonely spirit possesses a cold, leftover cup of tea. The teacup that Sinistea lives in is a famous piece of antique with many forgeries in circulation. The swirl pattern on Sinistea serves as a weakness. Should it get stirred, the swirl will disappear, and cause Sinstea to get dizzy. It can absorb the life-force of anyone who drinks it. While it can wait patiently, most of Sinistea`s opportunities ends up being short. The reason being that it tastes so bad, Sinistea get spat out immediately",
