  "description" : "Kanto Fair Presenter was conducting a festival called the Kanto Fair that Ash and his friends excitedly rush into while on their way to the White Ruins. The fair introduced the culture and specialties of the Kanto region to those in the Isshu Region. She got Professor Samual Oak to do a special video introducing the starter Pokémon he gives out and then would show them on stage to the audience.\nAs a special treat, she wanted to introduce the audience to her Hitokage but it really pushes its luck a lot. While using its special move Ember, it got a little too energetic as it was the first time it`s seen scenery different from Kanto`s. It started spinning out of control and damaged the stage and injured itself. Ash quickly came to its rescue and they went to Nurse Joy (Isshu). The Kanto Fair Presenter was last seen leaving the Pokémon Center with her bandaged up Hitokage as Ash told it not to be so reckless in the future.",
