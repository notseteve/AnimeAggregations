  "description" : "Initially ranked Librarian First Class, but is later promoted to Chief Librarian. She works on the inside as an informant in military intelligence, and is very good at gathering information. She is Kasahara`s room mate, and after Kasahara joins the task force, Shibasaki helps her study the catalogues in the base`s library through a form of negative reinforcement involving giving her candy when she gave the wrong answers which leads her to break out in pimples. Shibasaki often tells Kasahara things she finds out in regards to Kasahara and her direct superiors such as Dojo or Genda. She tries to give Kasahara advice and cheer her up when she is sulking due to events most often brought on by Dojo.",
