  "description" : "Aya Hasebe is a timid girl who draws original doujinshi. She usually gets Kazuki`s attention by pulling on his shirt rather than calling out to him. Aya`s circle is called \"Jamming Book Store\". Her doujinshi doesn`t sell well because she has a hard time attracting customers even though it has good artwork and costs only 200 yen. Kazuki admires her artwork and creative story so he tries to help her sell whenever he can.",
