  "description" : "Takanashi Hikari is a highly energetic http://anidb.net/t1409 [vampire]. She usually avoids biting other people`s necks, instead drinking blood packs sent by the government and using blood substitutes like tomato juice. Contrary to myths, she loves eating garlic and merely dislikes bright lights. She occasionally has the urge to nibble on someone, usually her sister. Despite her lackadaisical nature, she often strives to help others in need.\nSource: Wikipedia",
