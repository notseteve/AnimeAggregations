  "description" : "Chimchar is a small chimpanzee-based primate with orange fur. It is the Fire-type starter for the Sinnoh reigon. The flames on their rears are produced by burning gas in their stomachs. Chimchar also has a swirl-like symbol on the chest. The flames do not go out in the rain, and, unlike the tail flames of Charmander, those of Chimchar go out when they go to sleep.\nChimchar makes its first Pokémon anime appearance in the first episode of the Diamond and Pearl series, \"Following a Maiden Voyage!\", where it is shown as one of the three Sinnoh starter Pokémon in Professor Rowan`s lab. Paul, one of the rivals of Ash in the series, has a Chimchar he found in the wild. Paul later abandons Chimchar after a poor showing in a battle, and Ash asks it if it wants to join his team. Chimchar accepts.",
