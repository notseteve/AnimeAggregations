  "description" : "Chisato is Riju`s father. A handsome, young-looking man in his thirties, he attracts much attention from other men, as well as teenage boys. Chisato is extremely protective of Riju, who he is worried will be sexually harassed by other boys (especially Riju`s best friend, Shunsuke) because of his cute persona and small size. In the first episode, he actually makes a cake laced with laxatives to get some teenage boys out of the house that he feels threatened by. Ironically, the teenage boys were actually attracted to Chisato himself, rather than Riju. His paranoia is partly caused by his memories of his own sexual harassment in high school by his elder student, Kanzaki.",
