  "description" : "Feraligatr is the final form of the Totodile evolutionary line. Feraligatrs are massive, Godzilla-like crocodiles with long, blue bodies and four legs, although they may also stand upright on land. Their appendages have sharp claws at the ends, and its jaw is lined with teeth. On its head, back, and tail there are red, jagged scales. As stated in the Pokédex in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, \"Feraligatr intimidates its foes by opening its huge mouth. In battle, it will kick the ground hard with its thick and powerful hind legs to charge at the foe with incredible speed.\"\nFeraligatrs are ferocious and have a tendency to lash out at those that come too close. They eat Magikarp and other fish-like Pokémon, as well as larger prey (such as Stantler and Tauros) when they come close enough to the water.",
