  "description" : "He plays percussion and is the leader of Blast, usually handling the business partnerships and financial decisions needed for the band`s success. His favourite cigarette brand is \"Black Stones\", from which the band got their name. He is also a lawyer in training, despite his \"scary\" appearance.\nHe`s the big brother figure for Oosaki Nana and sometimes Nobu`s. He also acted as Nana`s \"guardian\" when she arrived in Tokyo. While he harbours some feelings for her, he baits Ren to rekindle their love for each other.\nIn the past, he shared several ties with Trapnest`s members. Yasu and Ren grew up in the same orphanage and remained close friends when Yasu was adopted. He dated Reira while in high school and was jealous of Takumi`s success and influence on her, which he later relates as the reasons for their break up. Also, he`s the oldest member of Blast which Nobu sometimes teases him about (by calling him \"old man\").",
