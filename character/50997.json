  "description" : "After dying in snow, Yuki Hime brought him back and is from now always by his side - both protecting him from evil and women. He comes from a family of physicians and says the colour of his hair is this weird because of his lineage and the early onset immunity to certain medicines/drugs. From that time he remembers a younger sister, Mutsuki, whom he is searching for since his death, carrying a hairpin with him that she once slipped into his pocket before being separated.\nHe is the holder of the Loyalty bead.",
