  "description" : "Zweilous is one of Ryuki`s main partner Pok√©mon. It quickly won the battle against Kiawe`s Marowak as it was distracted by the music. It then started off in a Single Battle against Ash`s Rowlet but when Ash`s Meltan ate part of Ryuki`s boots, the battle expanded to a Double Battle. It ended up losing as Rowlet learned Brave Bird during the battle and it proved to be too powerful for it and Ryuki`s Druddigon.",
