  "description" : "Baka Ki El Dogra is the first prince of the planet Dogura. He has an exceptionally high IQ and has little interest other than using it to torment those around him for his own amusement. Everybody refers to him solely as Prince or Prince Baka (a play with words since baka-ouji (バカ王子) can mean both Prince Baka and stupid prince).",
