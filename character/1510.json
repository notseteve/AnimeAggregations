  "description" : "By combining his own Spiral Energy with his comrades`, Simon created the ultimate entity, the titular Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann in the final battle against the Anti-Spirals. Not actually a mecha at all, it is a mass of materialized Spiral Energy on the scale of a galaxy. Though being similar to the Gurren Lagann, its design is overall very different from other mecha in the series, its armor being made up of red skulls bound together by Spiral Energy that burns continuously from its core, giving it the appearance of Team Dai-Gurren`s emblem.\nIt has been confirmed in the data books that the Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is 10 million light years (94,607,304,725,808,000,000,000 metres) in height.",
