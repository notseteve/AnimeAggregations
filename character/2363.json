  "description" : "A childhood friend of Lala, Ren is infamously known for wearing girls clothing during his play dates with Lala when he was a child. He arrives on Earth to win Lala by proving he is \"man enough\" for her, but becomes jealous of her relationship with Rito. Due to his pursuit of her, he accidentally gives Rito his first kiss. While Ren is furious, it has an unexpected consequence towards his \"alter ego\". As Ren is from planet Memorze, he can change gender in mind and body upon triggering a specific stimulus; in his case, a sneeze. As a girl, Run is in love with Rito, due to the kiss, and blames Lala for her misfortunes, while Ren is still in competition, albeit one-sided, with Rito for Lala`s hand in marriage.",
