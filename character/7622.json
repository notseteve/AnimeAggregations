  "description" : "The grandson of Ars√®ne Lupin is tall, lanky, impertinent, and very sneaky. His prime qualities are listed as \"appearing like a god, disappearing like a demon\"; in other words, he appears with a flash and leaves with a whisper. Despite being aided by many gadgets, his main talents lie in plotting and evasion of weapons.\nWhile his grandfather was known as the \"Gentleman Thief\", Lupin III has no qualms about trying to separate a woman from her modesty. He fancies himself as quite the ladies man, but his advances rarely succeeds. His primary weakness is his overconfidence and lust for Mine Fujiko.",
