The plesiosaur half is colored blue and white. It has a blue tail with a fin on top. The flippers are colored blue with white patches on the end and with white spots. The fish half is applied upside down. It has a round blue head with black rectangle pupils, and the mouth is located on top of head. It has white fins connected to its fish head.\nIt has trouble eating due to its mouth being on top of its head, even though it captures prey by freezing its surroundings. And while the skin on Arctovish`s face is impervious to attacks, it went extinct due to breathing difficulties.",
