  "description" : "Goryou Yuuto is a first-year university student taking up Literature. He is the guitarist and leader for the band Argonavis.\nEnthusiastic and passionate, he has a strong mentality and a positive attitude, believing that one day he can succeed in a band and prove himself to his family. \"You won`t know unless you try\" is his motto, and from that baseless confidence, he leads Argonavis. However, despite his optimistic and confident nature, he undermines his guitar skills to the point where he almost ended up quitting Argonavis, believing that he would drag the band down, and that someone else would be better suited as guitarist for the band than him.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream!
