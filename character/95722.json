  "description" : "Katou was a ghoul from the 13th Ward who formerly worked as a hairdresser. He was an extremely two-faced individual, concealing a sadistic personality behind a mask of kindness. His position as a hairdresser allowed him to target women, with him engaging in perverse rituals of eating their hair clippings while fantasizing about scalping them.\nSource: Tokyo Ghoul Wiki",
