  "description" : "The princess of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear who fully believes that the function of nobility is to tend to the needs of their subjects. She is loved by her people for her various public works projects. As Luke`s fiancée, she scolds him for his spoiled attitude and his dismissal of his duties as a noble.\nAs the anime progresses, it is revealed that Natalia is not the birth princess of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear—the true princess was a stillborn, so a midwife replaced the dead baby with the newborn baby of her daughter. Natalia is initially branded a traitor to the kingdom through the machinations of Grand Maestro Mohs and is sentenced to death, but her people rally behind her. Eventually, her father realises that even though they are not related by blood, Natalia is still his daughter. Natalia is dismayed to later learn that her biological father is Largo the Black Lion of the God-Generals.",
