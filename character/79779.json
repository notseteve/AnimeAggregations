  "description" : "After being captured from Brewers, the Gusion was rebuilt by Turbines for Akihiro`s use. Its form has been greatly changed by the use of spare Barbatos armor. The Alaya-Vijnana system of a captured Man Rodi has also been transplanted into this machine. Equipped with high-sensitivity sensors in its head, it can change into aiming mode to provide long-range support.\nSource: en.gundam.info",
