At the beginning he was only hired to do one job for the Freeden but later takes a more permanent position as one of her defenders. He`s pretty much a ladies man who does, however, care for each lover he has had. On a humorous note, Roybea displays the ability to accurately gauge a woman`s clothing sizes just by looking at her. He acquired his Gundam on a bet from a woman he considered his true love. He has a crush on Sala, who firmly rejects his advances. He and Ennil El eventually become a couple and are last seen in Witz`s hometown",
