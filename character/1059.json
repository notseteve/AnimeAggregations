  "description" : "Shuppet are nocturnal entities that feed on feelings of envy, vengeance, malice, and other negative emotions. They are able to capture negative feelings in the atmosphere by channeling them into its horn. The captured energy is used by Shuppet as sustenance, allowing it to grow. At the same time, the projected person feels much better as his negative emotions leave him. These Pokemon are therefore attracted to people who hold negative emotions, and are known to roam cities in the night in search of such grudges. If someone develops especially strong feelings of vengeance, Shuppet can group in a swarm to line up beneath the eaves of that person`s home.",
