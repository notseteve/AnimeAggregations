She wore a different uniform under this name, most notably a red mask, and her appearance and powers incorporated the use of a crescent motif.\nIn the early storyline of Sailor Moon, she is something of a celebrity figure, of whom Usagi is a great fan.\nSailor V was first introduced as the protagonist of Takeuchi Naoko`s much-shorter manga series, Codename: Sailor V, of which Sailor Moon is a sequel.\nSource: wiki",
