  "description" : "The demon fox who was originally considered the master of spirits, she is the head of the Kyoto youkai. According to Keikan records, Hagorome-Gitsune first appeared during turbulent times, possessed the body of a notable child, and took control of the body to attain adult form. Gathering power by absorbing hatred, envy, anger, despair and large quantities of malice from the center of government, she continued to grow stronger and it is said that the stronger the malice in the world, the stronger she will become. Despite this, she can only live as long as a human lifetime, for when her host body`s life reaches its end, she must hide her \"true form\" somewhere safe until a suitable candidate for her reincarnation appears. If her \"true form\" isn`t sealed, then regardless of how many times she is defeated, she will continue to reincarnate into the next generation.\n400 years ago, she posed as the legendary courtesan Yodo-dono and fought Nurarihyon at Osaka Castle, but was eventually defeated. In the course of 400 years, her reincarnation was repeatedly prevented due to Nura Rihan`s interferences, until Abe no Seimei and Sanmoto Gorouzaemon successfully plotted his murder by reviving and manipulating Rihan`s ex-wife, the ayakashi Yamabuki Otome. Yamabuki Otome` revived body (which resembled her previous appearance) later became Hagoromo Gitsune`s current host and successfully gave birth to Nue, Abe no Seimei`s reincarnation during the battle in Kyoto. Hagoromo Gitsune was eventually forced out of the host`s body by Rikuo`s Nenekirimaru and Yura`s Hangun. As soon as Nue broke out of his cocoon, he killed and sent Hagoromo Gitsune to hell.\nSource: wiki",
