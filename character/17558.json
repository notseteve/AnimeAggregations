  "description" : "Hagimura Suzu is the student council treasurer and in the same year as Takatoshi. She describes herself as a returning student with an IQ of 180, can do 10-digit arithmetic calculations in her head, and is fluent in multiple languages including English, but she is very sensitive about her short stature and consequently, her height makes her to look like an elementary school student, even though she is 16 years old at the start of the series. Many of the jokes involve her childish appearance or height; she flies into a rage whenever such subjects are mentioned. In situations where multiple characters are conversing, there are gags where only the top of her head is shown, or a caption and arrow points to where she is.\nSource: Wiki",
