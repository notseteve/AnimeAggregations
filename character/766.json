  "description" : "Cornelia Windsor held the post of Secretary of Transportation on the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance] http://anidb.net/ch6231 [High Council]. She was an outspoken advocate of invading the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] following the successful taking of http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress], on the basis of saving humanity from the tyranny of the Empire and the Goldenbaum Dynasty. However she was also a cynical realist and was fully aware of the underlying motive for an invasion: in order to secure a major military success to shore up flagging opinion polls in time for the next election. She was voted out of office following the Alliance`s disastrous invasion of the Galactic Empire and their defeat at the Battle of Amritsar.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
