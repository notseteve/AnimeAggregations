  "description" : "Ryuuya is a skilled, yet low-ranked samurai in charge of Kanna`s protection. Ryuuya quickly befriended Kanna. Unfortunately, after creating a diversion for Ryuuya and Uraha, Kanna was cursed by Buddhist monks to live an endless cycle of reincarnation, suffering, and death. Ryuuya dedicated the remainder of his life to finding a way to lift the curse, and though he never did, he had a child with Uraha in the hopes that their kin would eventually find a way to break the curse. His appearance greatly resembles Yukito.",
