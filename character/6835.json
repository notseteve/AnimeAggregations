  "description" : "Mika is a newspaper deliverer at another center, although she won`t admit it unless directly confronted. She is quick to blame others, and frequently turns her mistakes into inconveniences. When she becomes lost during a route, she literally runs into Kana, then forgives her by \"allowing\" her to escort her to her next stop. In the third episode, she and Kana become friends. She seems to have a crush on Kana, although this has yet to be confirmed outright.",
