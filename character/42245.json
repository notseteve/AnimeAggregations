  "description" : "The Captain is the http://anidb.net/ch7477 [Major]`s silent, stoic adjutant and bodyguard. Unlike the Major and Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch42247 [Rip van Winkle], he still wears a full uniform in the main story, which is similar to a M42 Greatcoat with its neckguard constantly turned up, and an M43 officer`s cap emblazoned with the Totenkopf symbol.\nHe is a natural werewolf, able to transform at will and fight in either human, werewolf or wolf form. He is also the second highest-ranking member of http://anidb.net/ch42233 [Millennium], but it is implied that he does not believe Millennium`s ideology and merely wants to find someone capable of killing him.\nSource: Wikipedia",
