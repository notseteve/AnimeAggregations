  "description" : "Zetsu is the only member of http://anidb.net/ch8599 [Akatsuki] to regularly act without a partner. This is in part a result of his ability to merge with any object and quickly travel to a new location, something that few other ninja are capable of. Because of this ability Zetsu serves a variety of different positions in Akatsuki, such as a spy that observes and reports on battles of interest or a lookout during Akatsuki`s meetings. He is cannibalistic, and is often sent to dispose of bodies Akatsuki does not want found, mirroring the large venus flytrap that envelops his body. Zetsu`s body is split into two different colours, his right side being black and his left being white. Similarly, the two sides have their own personalities and knowledge bases, frequently leading to discussions and arguments between the two. It has also been shown that each half of Zetsu has unique abilities, as in, the white half can make perfect clones of whoever he touches. But this proved useful as one personality can help in the http://anidb.net/ch12238 [Tailed Beast] sealing process as a projection while the other remains in the body to act as a guard. If necessary, the two halves can split apart and act independently. As Kishimoto originally planned Akatsuki to be a group of individuals with close to no human characteristics, he decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to better show his double personality. The black half`s dialogue is written in katakana in the Japanese manga, and the white half`s dialogue is written in kanji and kana.",
