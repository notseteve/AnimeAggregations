  "description" : "Berry is a childhood friend of Doctor White who works at a lumber mill in the Kalos region near Miare City. She has a very independent and strong personality and doesn`t like it when people like Doctor White tell her she`s should seek assistance. She considers not standing up for herself as a sign of weakness.\nDoctor White went to visit Berry with Jessie to check on Berry`s Bidoof after a Pokémon Hunter had set up a trap and it was caught but managed to escape by crushing the iron bars with the teeth it`s so proud of. He diagnosed it with swollen gums and treated it. Berry wanted to make the Hunter pay if she ever found him but Doctor White told her to get Officer Jenny (Kalos). She took offense to that as she thought that he still looked at her as a child.\nLater after Doctor White thought that Berry might have been hurt by a Pokémon Hunter and when he realized that she was safe, he confessed his feeling for her which Jessie overheard and realized that he liked Berry instead of her.",
