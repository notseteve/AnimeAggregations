  "description" : "Soft-spoken and elegant Tanima Yuri is the exact contrast of Hinagiku. She is very polite and very feminine, and one can seldom see her lose her temper. Yuri is quick to catch onto anything, which makes her a great and understanding friend. She lives with her father and mother, who is a fashion designer.\nAs one of the reporters of the school newspaper, Yuri takes great pride in her job. She loves reporting and watching the popular soccer team of Saint Flower Garden School, where she attends. Just like Momoko and Hinagiku, Yuri also has her eyes set on Yanagiba Kazuya, the captain and star player of that team. But she later also fell in love with Limone, the angel who always appeared to help the Ai Tenshi.",
