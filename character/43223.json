  "description" : "Komari is very childish, taking great interest in fairy-tales, picture books, candy, and clothing with many layers of frills. She is very clumsy, and will often not think before she acts. She does well in her studies and is also surprisingly athletic, though this is somewhat hampered by the fact that she is quite weak and has never done any sport properly before. This personality hides a past where she was traumatized by the death of her brother. She had blocked out her brother`s death from her mind, but remembers it after seeing a dead cat and goes crazy, thinking that Riki is her brother.\nSource: Wikipedia",
