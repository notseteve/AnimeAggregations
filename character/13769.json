  "description" : "Mike Bison is depicted as an African American boxer wearing blue trunks with white trim and a torn white shirt under a blue tank top. He wears red boxing gloves and boxing shoes. His hairstyle consists of short hair cut in an odd pointing style in the front, similar to Mike Tyson`s haircuts from the time Street Fighter II was made. Although usually removed when these illustrations are published outside Japan, some character illustrations feature his Japanese name, \"Bison\" on the waistband of his trunks. In Street Fighter IV, the waistband now reads \"Champion\".\n[Source: wiki]",
