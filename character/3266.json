  "description" : "Kalifa was http://anidb.net/ch3264 [Iceburg]`s secretary and is the only female member of http://anidb.net/ch3295 [CP9]. Kalifa is a slim woman with blue eyes and glasses that, like Kuro, she often pushes up. Her blonde hair was about shoulder length when she first infiltrated Water 7 and she grew it out over the years she spent undercover there. She kept it tied up in a bun as a secretary, but let it fall freely with a left sidelock when she was revealed to be an assassin.\nShe has small studded earrings and usually wears outfits that reveal her legs, something http://anidb.net/ch3267 [Paulie] often chides her about while she was undercover. As an assassin, she wore a long-sleeved short black dress over a fishnet shirt and stockings along with black gloves and high-heels.\nIn the Volume 44 SBS, it was revealed that Kalifa was very bookish as a child.",
