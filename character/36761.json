  "description" : "Hyoudou Issei is the male protagonist of High School DxD. He lives with his parents and is currently a second-year student at Kuoh Academy. His rank in Rias` peerage is \"Pawn\", and his power as a Devil ranks at the bottom so far (which increases as the series progresses). However on his left arm he wields the Sacred Gear, Boosted Gear, making him a dangerous opponent to underestimate. His goal is to one day rise in rank into a High-class Devil so that he can gather his own servants and create his own harem.",
