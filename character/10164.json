Mixing her two specialties, Pinako is also a prominent automail engineer and presumably the founder of Rockbell Automail, a family-run automail atelier within the town. Pinako also happens to be the grandmother of http://anidb.net/ch6588 [Winry Rockbell] as well as the neighbor and close family friend of the Elrics - http://anidb.net/ch7783 [Van Hohenheim], http://anidb.net/ch7784 [Trisha], http://anidb.net/ch5885 [Edward] and http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse]. As Winry`s only remaining blood relative after the death of her parents, and the closest adult to the Elric brothers after their mother`s passing and their father`s disappearance, Pinako acts as caretaker to the three youngsters, training Winry in automail engineering and serving as Ed and Al`s home base whenever they return to Resembool.",
