  "description" : "Tanaka is the house steward who has served under the former Master Phantomhive. He was present when Ciel`s parents were killed and was stabbed in the back during the incident and as a result, rarely does any work or even talking. Sebastian seems to respect him the most out of all the staff. He is usually seen drinking from a Japanese tea cup. Despite his appearance, Tanaka is capable of killing intruders. Prior to Sebastian`s appointment as Ciel`s butler, Tanaka served as the head butler of the Phantomhive household, for both Ciel`s father and Ciel; when Sebastian is apparently murdered, Ciel appoints Tanaka as the head butler again. In the anime, he is commonly in a super deformed form. When he is not, he is as capable a servant as Sebastian. As the series progresses, he is seen less often in a super deformed form.",
