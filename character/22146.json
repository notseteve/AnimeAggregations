  "description" : "The Earth Alliance`s first mass-produced mobile suit, which was based on data from the prototype Strike Gundam. The Strike Dagger`s operating system is designed for use by Naturals, making it possible for ordinary Alliance soldiers to pilot these complex machines. Its design has been greatly simplified due to the requirements of wartime production, and it thus lacks the Phase Shift Armor, Striker pack technology, and overall high performance of the original Strike. Nonetheless, these incomplete machines soon prove their worth in mass battle against ZAFT`s own mobile suit forces.",
