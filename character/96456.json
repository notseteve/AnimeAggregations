  "description" : "Ebitani was a part of http://anidb.net/ch25682 [Tonegawa]`s team. His boss thought of him as clueless, yet passionate.\nNot too long after joining Tonegawa`s team, his rivalry with http://anidb.net/ch96453 [Yamazaki Kenji] and idiocy resulted in a horribly-planned, horribly-executed manoeuvre which angered http://anidb.net/ch10162 [the Teiai Group president], who promptly fired him personally. After getting fired, and despite receiving help from his former boss, he struggled to recover from his predicament.\nHaving lost everything, Ebitani began to criticize his former employer in social media and gained a significant following. However, Tonegawa eventually caught wind of Ebitani`s actions and compelled him to fix the damage he had caused by pressing him as the new social media manager of the Teiai Group.",
