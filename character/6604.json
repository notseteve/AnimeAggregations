  "description" : "A half-breed girl who has a werewolf father, called Volg Wildman, and a human mother. She at first believes that her older brother was murdered by Hime, but later reconciles with Hime when she learns what really happened that night. In order to find who in the Royalty executed her brother, she stays with Hime. Being of mixed blood, Liza can only transform her arms up to her elbow and her combat capabilities can`t compare to that of a pure breed, though she is physically stronger than a normal human. Her mixed blood also gives her heightened senses of hearing and smell. Liza appears to have feelings for Hiro and has \"squishy\" paws, according to Hiro and one of his classmates. She and Reiri are natural enemies, and they don`t get along until later on. She particularly enjoys fast vehicles, much to Hiro`s horror when he`s dragged along.",
