  "description" : "The Head of the Supernatural Phenomenon Treatment Bureau as well as known by being its greatest traitor, the Bureau`s biggest mistake, and by Ooka as \"The Empire`s Terrorist\". She is the young butterfly girl (codenamed: Electric Butterfly) that cameos in almost every episode as a background character up until episode 13. At the moment it is unknown to what she has done but Ooka states that \"even the death sentence wasn`t enough\". She usually acts and talks innocently but is very cryptic and seems as everything she does has an ulterior motive; even frightening Chika with her presence alone.",
