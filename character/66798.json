His main partner Kamex can Mega Evolve into Mega Kamex.\nNurse Joy told Alan that Siebold of the Kalos Region Elite Four had a restaurant nearby, so Alan went to challenge him. When Siebold approached Alan, Alan told him that he wanted to try Zumi`s unofficial menu. The two battled in a 1-on-1 Mega Evolution battle and despite the type disadvantage, Alan held his own for most of the battle until he finally lost. Siebold was impressed with Alan as he was powerful enough to corner him even with a type disadvantage. He complemented him on an excellent battle as it had been a while since he \"last had fresh meat with a backbone\".",
