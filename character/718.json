  "description" : "Takashi Morinozuka, usually called Mori, is a third-year at Ouran High School. Mori is depicted as tall, quiet and somewhat intimidating, but he is very protective of Hunny (who he calls by his first name, Mitsukuni, and vice versa). It was seen in the anime and manga where Hunny had a toothache. Mori blamed himself for not reminding Hunny to brush his teeth. He then restricted Hunny from eating candy until he had a filling for his cavity. Hunny ended up judo-throwing Mori to the floor in a fit of anger, but they made up soon afterwards. The Morinozuka family had protected and served the Haninozuka family for many generations. As the two families were joined by marriage two generations back, the families became related to each other, thus breaking the master-servant tradition. Nevertheless, Mori still faithfully protects Hunny and is always by his side, attending to his wishes and watching out for him; his protective personality extends to his classmates and the host club members, resulting in his gaining a certain level of respect. Although as a host, he is considered the \"wild\" type (changed to the strong, silent type in the dub, most likely to make it less confusing as it`s not explained why he`s the wild type), he normally doesn`t try to woo girls. The girls like how he cares for Hunny, and shyer customers are attracted to his tall physique and taciturn personality. Mori`s hobbies include kendo, of which he is the national champion.",
