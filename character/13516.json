  "description" : "The Unicorn`s appearance when the `NT-D` system is activated. In this form, the psycoframe built into the entire body`s movable frame reads the pilot`s thoughts (psycowaves) and directly influences the unit`s movements. In other words, the MS can ultimately be controlled by thought alone. However, when compared to one`s idea of how a human body works, the stress of gravity on a 20 meter MS (more than 10 times the size) is extraordinary. Aided by the psycommu, the pilot`s mind can only endure about five minutes of operation, after which a limiter is believed to activate, returning the MS to normal Unicorn form. Furthermore, the system activates not according to the pilot`s discretion, but automatically when certain conditions, as yet unexplained, are met. In this mode, the mobile suit becomes taller and its head transforms to one having standard Gundam features.",
