  "description" : "Isidro is a young runaway thief who joins http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] in his travels as a member of the swordsman`s traveling party.\nHe has always dreamed to be, if not a soldier, the best mercenary warrior of his time. The inspiration for his ambitions is the legend of a once formidable captain - the great \"Hundred Man Slayer\" - who fought in the original http://anidb.net/ch2063 [Band of the Hawk]. Although Guts has never revealed to Isidro that he is in fact the young boy`s idol, he has supported his dream nonetheless. Being a younger member of the group, Isidro looks up to Guts as a father figure, despite his insistence to the contrary. Currently, he is training under Guts, hoping to achieve his dream of becoming the greatest swordsman in the world. Rather than teaching Isidro his moves, Guts instructs him to learn to fight using his own style, as each person has a different strength, speed, height, and arm-reach. Isidro develops his spinning move using a cutlass, passed down to him by Morgan, and the Salamander Dagger, given by http://anidb.net/ch87815 [Flora].\nWhen receiving compliments individually or as part of the group Isidro and http://anidb.net/ch81095 [Puck] normally brag about how they can manage things themselves. However, both vastly exaggerate their own aptitude for combat. The two are extremely close friends and Puck often sits on the young boy`s head, seeing himself as a mentor of such to the boy. Puck attempts to teach him in the ways of the \"Elf Dimension Style\", to little success.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
