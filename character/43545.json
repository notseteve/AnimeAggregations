  "description" : "One of Curry`s bodyguards. She has an obsessive crush on Valmet, who she admires as a fellow warrior. She is amazed by Valmet`s skills, especially because of the fact that she only has one eye but can easily defeat her in the dark. They have fought many times, but Mildo has never won. Mildo is a knife-trained mercenary and as such, prefers using combat knives and machetes as her main weapon. She has a short temper and will kill anyone who annoys her, even if it messes up her boss`s plans. However even though she seems to be heartless, she once told Valmet that she believes warriors are hollow and she hopes that if she can become as strong as Valmet she might find something to fill the void.",
