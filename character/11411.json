  "description" : "Despite his threatening sounding name, Ox-King is really quite harmless and fun loving. He was somewhat demonic when his castle became engulfed in flames on Fire Mountain during a picnic with his daughter, and wreaked havoc through the village at the foot of the mountain. He is Chichi`s biological father and thus, Gokuu`s father-in-law. He is very strong and trained alongside Grandpa Gohan under Kame Sennin`s tutelage.",
