  "description" : "Miyata Akira has a reputation for being clumsy because she frequently trips and falls. She is very sensitive about her clumsiness, but she is, ironically, also a member of the Intelligence Club in the anime episodes. Her number is 002. Her only redeeming characteristic is her razor buzz haircut. Due to her clumsiness, Akira is frequently referred to by Inugami as dojikko, which usually translates to a stereotypical clumsy girl. Akira is also seen and talks about her membership in the Falling Club, an obvious joke about her clumsiness.\nHer data as mentioned in the anime:\nStudy: 1\nAthletics: 1\nCooking: 1\nStyle: 5",
