  "description" : "Lashara is the 12 year-old ruler of the Shitoreiyu Empire. The sudden death of her father Koyo causes her to inherit the throne, but as the series begins she is travelling away to school in the Holy Land. However, she slowly loses her position of power to Babalun as the series progresses. When not busy with other tasks, she is usually seen busily adding up her finances with an abacus, as her kingdom is currently in debt. She takes Kenshi in as a servant after he fails to follow through on an attempt to assassinate her, and along with Chiaia she kept Kenshi`s identity a secret until he showed his capabilities in battle. Lashara is the niece of Flora. It is hinted that she is most likely in love with Kenshi, but given her circumstances, she is not allowed to show such feelings to others. She shows a bit of curiosity towards the opposite sex, as shown in episodes 2 and 3 where she is shown to be a little perverted about Kenshi. Despite her mature-like behaviour, she claims that she acts this way because of her upbringing and former education, not because she was like that initially. Her personal vessel is the Swan.\nHer name is a reference to Lashara Moon and Photon Earth from Kajishima`s earlier work, Photon.\nSource: wiki",
