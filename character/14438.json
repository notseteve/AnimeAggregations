  "description" : "Chiaki is a high school student who moves into Maron`s and Miyako`s building and transfers to their class, for the purposes of getting close to Maron to stop her from collecting the demons. He also met an angel, Access Time, who gave him the power to become \"Kaitou Sinbad\". Like Maron, Chiaki lives alone, having run away because he was tired of his father`s continuing to marry new women after his mother`s death. He later reconciles with his father after introducing him to Maron. Initially he tries to seduce Maron to stop her, however as the series progresses he finds that he has actually fallen in love with her, and fights to regain her trust after she discovers he is also Kaitou Sinbad.",
