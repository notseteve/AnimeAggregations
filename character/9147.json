  "description" : "The younger sister of Shuutaro, Ryoko is a spoiled girl whose only amusement seems to be the creation and execution of elaborate plans intended to drive her older brother mad. Sometimes, just for fun, she flirts with Ataru, whom her brother has banned from setting foot inside the massive Mendo Mansion (not that it ever stops him). Her schemes frequently drag Lum and her friends along and result in massive physical damage to all involved except herself. She is attended to by masked kuroko who perform her every wish, including delivering messages and playing her horse. Ryoko says she is in love with Shuutaro`s rival Tobimaro Mizunokoji, but we`re not sure if she`s serious, since she has said the same thing about Ataru and her brother`s personal guard, Shingo. She excels at playing the innocent bystander, even as she sets up all the carnage that surrounds her.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
