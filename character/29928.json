  "description" : "Toyama is the school bully and formerly a member of the Kendo Club. He often ditches kendo practice and had caused all the previous club members to quit (with the exception of Kirino and Sayako) by pretending to \"teach\" them techniques, which was just him constantly hitting them with his shinai. Miyako attempts to teach him and Iwasa a lesson one time, but fails to do so when Sayako crashes into her. It appears that neither Toyama nor Iwasa come to kendo anymore. It is also shown in episodes twenty-two and twenty-three that he and Iwasa are delinquents, as they fought two other students when provoked in a video game arcade and destroyed two machines--an act that almost led to the kendo club`s suspension. Although he and Iwasa terrorized the kendo club during their brief time in the club, Toyama actually feels that he is not as strong as he appears, as shown in episode twenty-four of the anime. Eventually both he and Iwasa decide to resign from the club to save it from suspension, even though they both do not hate kendo. Its implied that`s he`s afraid of Tamaki due to her strength after easily losing to her. In the closing credits of the anime`s final episodes, it is shown that he has joined the soccer team with Iwasa, and he is verbally fighting with an opposing player.\nSource: wiki",
