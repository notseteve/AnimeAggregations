  "description" : "GN Archer (pronounced \"Gun Archer\") is an transformable MS weapons support craft that can change to a MS unit and combinable with GN-007 Arios Gundam. Built in the L3 resource satellite, it was originally designed as a 3rd generation Gundam, but the idea was abandoned before its completion. It was redesigned into a support machine instead and given a huge GN Condenser. When combined, it feeds off GN particles from Arios` GN Drive. For the concept of the MS, it`s an improved model of Kyrios`s GN Tail Booster. This suit can combine with Arios for more weaponry, and when a pilot is in it, can transform into a MS to operate independently. Below the container, there`s space to mount guns.\nIn mobile suit form, GN Archer has two wide spread beam rifles to attack enemy units. The GN Missile Launcher upon its back can still fire salvos of missiles against enemy units to help Arios fend off enemy targets. GN Archer`s combat capabilities are comparatively lesser than the Gundams, but it`s capabilities rivals any GNX III and/or Aheads in the battlefield; the lack of a GN Drive limits its operation in combat.",
