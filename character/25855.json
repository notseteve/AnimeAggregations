  "description" : "Roya is a 16-year-old girl from Tusk, and it`s been revealed she was a native. Living in Templer, she is the disciple of the elder sage Zicco, who rescued 6-year-old Roya from Tusk. She was to be killed after it was predicted that she would kill her father, Morocco. Therefore as growing up in Templer, she was falsely told to be an orphan. She is a new-found friend of Zed, and old friend of Mikki. It is somewhat hinted to at the beginning that she may be interested in a more romantic way to Zed, but Zed, at first, is somewhat oblivious to this.",
