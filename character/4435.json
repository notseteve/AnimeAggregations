  "description" : "A fox deity that used to be the Guardian of the Mizuchi family. Kuugen was sealed away by a Water Priest because of her mischievous behaviour. She was released by Noboru after Tooru was targeted by a demon and now serves as their guardian. She can become male or female at any time, but uses the pronoun ore to refer to herself which is usually only used by males in Japan, though in the past females did use the pronoun as well. She attracts a fair bit of attention because of her blonde hair, blue eyes and fox ears, which have to be covered by a hat when out in public, though she can also hide them completely without a hat (they involuntarily pop out if she gets distracted or excited, though).",
