  "description" : "He is a Space Federation Force lieutenant commander and captain of the battleship Jacinthe, used to transport VIPs.\nHowever, he is secretly a special operative belonging to the Neo Terrors and an unlawful agent that is executing missions of assassinations, sabotage, and the like.\nSupposing that the protagonist is even interested in his own fame, he has absolutely no political ambitions and has no interest in both the Neo Terrors and New Soral, but he is attached more to the Neo Terrors` extent of depravity, which is more realistically human, than to the New Soral faction`s tenets and conduct, which is heard as hypocrisy.\nThe protagonist`s interests are in human brainwashing technology through the brainwashing device, \"Memory Plant,\" and, in a sense, considers it being useful to his own fame. As an idea, he is also in a way intoxicated with the fearless deed of being a god and artificially creating an absolutely new personality.\nIn his past, he was imprisoned because of his failure on a mission that involved Lieri and Naomi, and after his release, he altered his face and came to be at his current position, determined to exact revenge on the two of them.\nsource: official website`s character page, translated by lf412",
