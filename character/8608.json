  "description" : "Sai is introduced during Part II of the series as http://anidb.net/ch7719 [Uchiha Sasuke]`s replacement in Team 7. Having been a member of The Foundation since he was a child, Sai has been trained to not possess or desire any type of emotion or camaraderie. After spending time with http://anidb.net/ch226 [Uzumaki Naruto], however, he begins to crave bonds with other people, which has since become his primary role in the series. Sai`s attempts to form bonds involve giving pet names to others; however, he often says what he actually thinks of a person, resulting with him choosing names such as \"fatso\" and \"ugly\". He eventually learns from his mistakes and attempts the opposite approach, for instance, calling http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Yamanaka Ino] \"pretty lady\". When not making an attempt to bond with others, Sai spends his time painting and drawing, and has produced thousands of works. His artistic talents extend to his choice of attacks in battles: he can infuse chakra with his inking brush to make his drawings come to life.",
