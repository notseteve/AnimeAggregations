  "description" : "Team Rocket is a highly organized criminal syndicate \"in pursuit of evil\" headed by Giovanni (called \"The Boss\" by his underlings) and based in Kanto. Its main focus is in stealing or capturing, then selling, rare and/or strong Pokemon, but it also conducts cruel experimental research on Pokemon. According to the Generation II games, the Team Rocket Oath says: \"Steal Pokemon for profit. Exploit Pokemon for profit. All Pokemon exist for the glory of Team Rocket.\" Team Rocket`s final goal is to take over the world using Pokemon.\nIn the anime, Team Rocket is based in Kanto, with many smaller branches reaching out in Kanto and Johto. Giovanni is the Gym Leader of Viridian City during the early part of Ash`s journey. There is also an underground school for training aspiring Team Rocket members. In addition, Team Rocket had its headquarters near Pallet Town and Viridian City, but this was destroyed by Mewtwo in its rage; it is unknown where the headquarters are now. All that is known is that the headquarters are now in a large building built at the end of a canyon and guarded by many grunts, seen when Jessie, James, and Meowth returned from the Hoenn region to report back to Giovanni.",
