Rising to prominence during the late Goldenbaum Dynasty, the Black Lancers became infamous for their unmatched aggression and offensive tactics, becoming one of the most well-known fleets under http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] and possessing a strong esprit de corps. The fleet was also unique in using the fast battleship in place of the standard battleship, which gave the Black Lancers strong offensive power and mobility. The ships of this fleet were painted entirely black except for the Imperial crest and sensor domes on their hulls.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
