  "description" : "Sumi is 17 years old even though she looks like a grade-schooler. She is very rich and has a spoiled attitude because of that. She and Ink were friends when they were younger but for unknown reasons they broke apart, even though Ink still tries to be Sumi`s friend. The end of her ahoge (the long strand of hair coming from the front of her head) usually portrays whatever she is feeling.",
