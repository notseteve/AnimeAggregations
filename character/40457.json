  "description" : "Yuto`s Lilligant lives with Yuto on Milos Island in the Unova region. Yuto`s Lilligant helps Yuto harvest Revival Herbs by searching in the forest for them and he supplies them to the people of Hodomoe City and the surrounding areas. When Ash and his friends first met Yuto`s Lilligant it was ill just like all the Monmen which used to fly around the grassfields. Yuto explained that he`d looked everywhere for Revival herbs lately but could hardly find any and when he thought he finally did, they were all withered. After Landlos, Voltolos and Tornelos were are assembled and had stopped fighting they rejuvenated the soil to become rich again and Yuto`s Lilligant recovered from its illness.",
