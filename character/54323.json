  "description" : "Ange is the youngest member of Team Rabbits who joins halfway through the series piloting the Black 6, specializing in mid-range artillery and close quarters combat. Ange`s gender is never revealed and the rest of the team has divided opinions about it. Despite being farther skilled and better trained than the rest, Ange is usually shy when speaking to others, but displays a vicious and berserk demeanor when in battle. Ange`s mecha has an automated maintenance system that dispenses the need of a pit crew most of the time.\nSource: Wiki",
