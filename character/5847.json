  "description" : "Despite having the cruelty of a child, Russia is the tallest of all the nations. He adores vodka and sunflowers. His primary hate is \"General Winter\", despite using the cold to his advantage in war. Russia has a kind and gentle face, but has mentally cracked from the strain of his bloody history. The other nations are mortified by him, particularly Lithuania, whom he loves to both physically and emotionally abuse. Occasionally, he stalks others while in a panda costume. Russia promises that eventually \"everyone will become one with Russia\". He also frequently says \"KolKolKolKol\" to nations he is threatening. Russia is almost always seen carrying a section of pipe. He is classified as a yandere character.",
