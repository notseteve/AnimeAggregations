  "description" : "Taiseki was a shinobi from http://anidb.net/ch12200 [Iwagakure] who fought and died during the Third Great Shinobi World War. He formed a team with Kakkou, using their superb diversionary tactics to attack the enemy. With his Hiding with Camouflage Technique he was able to approach his enemies from their blind spot, easily killing them with a single strike. He confronted Team Minato, led by http://anidb.net/ch7248 [Hatake Kakashi], during the Third Great Shinobi World War, managing to take http://anidb.net/ch10927 [Rin] captive. He was later killed by http://anidb.net/ch10928 [Uchiha Obito], however, while he and Kakashi attempted to rescue Rin. Taiseki also injured Kakashi`s eye, leading to him gaining his Sharingan from Obito.",
