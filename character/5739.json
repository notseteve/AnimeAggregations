  "description" : "Gilbert`s chain. Previously Glen`s chain. Sealed by the Nightray family and eventually tamed by Gilbert. Can use teleportation at a great strain to the user. It`s shown in Retrace 45 that Raven remembers Gilbert from the past, saying that he has seen him three times. The first time he disturbed him, the second time he came to visit, and the time when he made the contract. He also said that he`d be bound to Gilbert`s left arm again.\nSource: Wikipedia",
