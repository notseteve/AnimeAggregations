  "description" : "Hercules is a grim-looking kappa who sits all by himself on a bench in the corner of the park. He is feared by humans, animals and kappas alike -- except Kaatan. This fear is well-founded, as he has shown that he has the skill to remove spirit balls from various living beings.\nIn reality, his actual name is Chii-chan, and he can`t even eat his spirit candy unless Miyo-chan feeds him. He desperately wants to learn to play the trumpet, but his beak is a bit of an impediment.",
