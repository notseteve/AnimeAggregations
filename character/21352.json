He specializes in pathology and collects corpses for dissection and study, earning him the nickname \"The Corpse Doctor.\" He has a morbid interest in dissection. Nonetheless he has a kind heart, and makes a star-shaped memorial for each corpse he dissects. Zazie hated him at one point, because he thought Thunderland had taken a group of street kittens Zazie liked, however, it was shown he only quarantined them.",
