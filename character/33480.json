  "description" : "June was trained alongside Andromeda Shun on Andromeda Island under the tutelage of Cepheus Daidalos. She was very protective of the Andromeda Saint, and tried to make him quit to avoid him getting hurt. Despite her wishes, Shun attained Sainthood and left for Japan, leaving June behind. She completed her training successfully and earned the Bronze Chamaeleon Cloth. Soon after, her master was assassinated by Pisces Aphrodite. When she heard about the Bronze Saints` plans to defy Sanctuary, she immediately set out to stop Shun. Shun respected her feelings but intended to join his brothers nevertheless, and knocked her unconscious in a small fight. The Andromeda Saint carried her to the Kido mansion to rest until his return.",
