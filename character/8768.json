  "description" : "Sakaki Shio is a 29-year-old extremely powerful, self-proclaimed 100-dan karate master. He claimed not to take disciples at first, but gradually grew to like Ken`ichi and is always eager to train him. He has a soft side which he tries to hide behind his tough guy attitude, and is usually the one worrying about Ken`ichi the most despite acting like he does not care. He is also a terrible liar and often fails to hide his concern for Ken`ichi. He likes to gamble and can usually be seen drinking alcohol.",
