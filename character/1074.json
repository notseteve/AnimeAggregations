  "description" : "Sealeo lives in herds among the ice floes of Arctic regions, and these herds consist of both itself and its other evolutionary forms Spheal and Walrein. Its flippers are quite powerful: they are strong enough to shatter ice with well-placed flaps. Five times a day, Sealeo dives into the sea to hunt prey.\nSealeo`s behavior revolves mostly around its sensitive nose; Sealeo uses it to investigate new things. It lifts new objects up with its nose, and rolls them around. While rolling an object, Sealeo checks the object`s aroma and texture in order to learn about it. This is what it does to differentiate food from anything else, making it a vital ability for survival. However, Sealeo also takes a liking to balancing and spinning a younger Spheal on its nose for entertainment.",
