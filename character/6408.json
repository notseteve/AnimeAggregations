  "description" : "A highly-strung, overachieving girl who considers Tokino her arch-enemy. Renko`s history with Tokino goes back to their days in kindergarten: it is revealed that Tokino once took so long in the bathroom that Renko, unable to wait any longer, wet herself. Ever since that time, Renko has made it her personal mission to somehow embarrass and humiliate Tokino in return. Renko has the unusual ability to read an entire book in under a minuteâ€”but unfortunately, she can only remember the information she has read for three minutes afterward.",
