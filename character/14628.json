  "description" : "Himeka is Karin`s friend and Kazune`s \"cousin\". She is also Suzune`s \"sister\" due to the fact that she is the child of Suzuka and Kazuto. Originally she contained Kazuto`s god research data, she was then split into two by Kirihiko attempting to steal the research data. One half lives with Kazune, while the other lives with the Karasumas. When one Himeka becomes stronger, the other becomes weaker. Since she was a young girl, she has always defended Kazune, who was a bit of a crybaby when they were little. She loves bugs and is a good cook. She is in 8th grade. Like Karin, she does poorly in school. It is later revealed that she is Kazuto and Suzuka`s daughter. She tells Karin at one point that while she has a strong affection for Kazune, it is not necessarily a romantic attachment, as Kazune is \"kind of like a brother and kind of like a dad\" to Himeka (referencing Kazune`s identity as a clone of Himeka`s father).\nShe also witnessed Kazune and Karin kissing in the anime. Later in the series, Kazune says that Himeka is his daughter (along with Karin in Kamichama Karin 7).",
