  "description" : "Wingull is a common seagull-like Pok√©mon species found in the Hoenn region. A common annoyance to those surfing from place to place, it shows up on every water route. It has the habit of carrying prey and valuables in its beak, and has been known to hide them in all sorts of locations. Sejon rides the winds and flies as if it were skating across the sky.",
