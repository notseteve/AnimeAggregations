  "description" : "Mizunashi Akari is native of Manhome (Earth) who immigrated to Aqua when she was 15 to become an Undine. While not as skillful at sculling a gondola as http://anidb.net/ch8499 [Alice], nor as familiar with the history of her adopted city as http://anidb.net/ch8498 [Aika], Akari makes friends quickly and converses easily with customers and other strangers. She finds enjoyment in things or events that others think humdrum and mundane, for which Aika and Alice call her \"mysterious.\" Akari often says \"hohe\" or \"hahi\", which is her short version of \"wow\".\nWhen Akari used gondola simulations on Manhome, she accidentally learned how to row backwards and had to relearn the proper method when she started at http://anidb.net/ch7786 [Aria Company]; however, as Aika notes, \"Akari is almost invincible when she rows backwards\".\nShe is promoted last out of three; both Alice and Aika were recently promoted to Primas. Akari received the title \"Aquamarine\" (遙かなる蒼[アクアマリン], Harukanaru Ao, lit. \"Distant Blue\") upon her promotion.",
