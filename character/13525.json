  "description" : "In U.C. 0093, Zeon Zum Deikun`s son, Casval Rem Deikun (aka Zeon`s legendary ace, Char Aznable, the \"Red Comet\"), created a second Neo Zeon. This movement was founded under the ceremonial goal of \"speeding up\" the space migration of all of humanity, so the theoretical evolution of humanity into Newtypes could be realised. Char`s plan involved a series of massive asteroid drops against the Earth, ultimately leading to an eternal nuclear winter, rendering the planet uninhabitable. The final collision attempt was to involve the Axis asteroid, headquarters of the previous Neo Zeon movement. The plan was ultimately foiled by the Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce, headed by Bright Noa, and his old adversary from the One Year War, Amuro Ray, when Amuro managed to push the falling Axis away, sacrificing himself and killing Char in the process (while their deaths were never officially confirmed in the movie, their deaths are confirmed in the novelization of Char`s Counterattack). Char`s loss of the second Neo Zeon movement effectively ended the Zeon/Neo Zeon movement.\nIn U.C. 0100, the Republic of Zeon officially rejoined the Earth Federation.",
