  "description" : "Makken is a fairly silent man who is an important part of Team Dai-Gurren, but has rarely spoken or gotten much screen time whatsoever. He has his own Gunmen, Moshogun, which is based on an ancient samurai.\nAfter the timeskip, Makken is married to Leite with three children. Sadly, he is killed in the first deep space battle versus the Anti-Spirals, after sacrificing himself to stop a large Anti-Spiral missile from destroying the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren.\nIn the epilogue, a memorial site, in the form of a sword, is seen in his honour right alongside Kamina and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren.",
