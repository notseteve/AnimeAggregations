  "description" : "The Marasai is an improved version of the Hizack, developed by Anaheim Electronics and offered to the Titans as a diplomatic gesture. Thanks to its lightweight Gundarium alloy armour, the Marasai has greater propellant capacity than the Hizack, and its improved rocket engines make it faster as well. Most importantly, its higher power output enables it to drive two types of beam weapons simultaneously. While it never fully replaces the Hizack in the Titans ranks, this versatile mobile suit is often assigned to novice pilots.",
