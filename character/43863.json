  "description" : "Gavil is a human-sized being covered in white fur, with wings like those of an angel. He disdains the innate abilities of his kind in favor of technology, piloting his own http://anidb.net/ch49550 [Saubergeran] and using anti-noise and remote-controlled fighters to combat the effects of http://anidb.net/ch10993 [Basara]`s singing. Extremely vain and arrogant, he delights in the \"beauty\" of destruction, particularly that created by http://anidb.net/ch49520 [Glavil], whom he regards as his own \"flesh\" -- yet he remains loyal to the plans of Lord http://anidb.net/ch43875 [Geperuniti], though he occasionally questions his leader`s methods. He develops an intense hatred of ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch41155 [Gamlin Kizaki], who humiliates him time and again in battle, most notably on many occasions destroying his vehicle and forcing him to retreat under his own power.\nSource: wiki",
