  "description" : "Rose is a young woman introduced at the very start of the series. She is a devout believer in her town`s local faith, believing that serving the church will bring back her dead boyfriend. The Elric brothers` arrival in town opens Rose`s eyes to the church`s corruption and forces her to realize her boyfriend is not coming back. Rose does not appear again until much later in the series. In the manga she helps to rebuild the town, eventually reuniting with http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric]. In the anime she instead becomes the mute \"Holy Mother\" of the townspeople, giving them a symbol of guidance as they rise up against the State Military. Rose loses her voice after being captured by a soldier of the military.",
