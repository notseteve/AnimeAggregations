  "description" : "Hayate`s Charjabug is the car Pok√©mon for Team Red Meteor. Hayate`s father did everything in his power to find the ultimate Dendimushi which was even alternately colored. It has the fastest Nature, Timid and the perfect Ability, Run Away! As it is an alternately colored Red Denjimushi, it automatically was considered to be the fastest and race favourite. This is also a joke referencing the original Gundam Char Red Comet`s mobile suit red trope, where his suit was painted red and was three times faster.\nIt competed in the 25th Kokeko Cup where Hayate`s pushy nature ended up being too much for their Dendimushi car which got stuck on ice going up a hill in the 3rd and final stage, resulting in them loosing the race to Sophocles`s Charjabug car.",
