She is well known as the school idol by her friends and school peers, and one of the most popular students at her school; she has been shown to be quick tempered, even when she doesn`t get her way but she means well and is also friendly and kind. Like her friends and pretty much all the students at her school, she greatly admires her school teacher Yayoi, who has recently gotten married to Tatsuya, another teacher at her school. She harbors some slight jealousy, for Tatsuya`s marriage with Yayoi as she has been shown to have romantic feelings for him, even before he got married.",
