  "description" : "Forest`s Rhyperior was revealed when Forest sent it out to battle against Nurse Joy to see if Forest was good enough to be the Gym Leader of the Pewter City Gym. Forest`s Rhyperior was up against Nurse Joy`s Latias in the battle but its strength and determination showed that is was trained well by Forest. It`s Dig/Megahorn combination proved to be very effective against Nurse Joy`s Latias but it still wasn`t enough to defeat it. Even though Forest`s Rhyperior lost the battle, Nurse Joy recognized that it was a close battle and she was satisfied with Forest`s ability as a Gym Leader as Forest`s Rhyperior really showcased that to her in the battle.",
