  "description" : "Kaga is the unofficial leader and spokesman of the Steel Angels working for the Academy. She is sent, along with Kaori and Tsunami, to destroy Kurumi and retrieve the Mark II Angel Heart. Kaga has a set of boomerang-like weapons that she can throw with deadly accuracy. She believes that Kurumi and her Mark II Heart are dangerous and should not be allowed to continue functioning.\nThere is evidence that Kaga is not truly a bad person, since she instructs Nakahito to stay back during her fight with Kurumi so he won`t get hurt.",
