  "description" : "Illkubo is by far the most powerful of the five and the Dark King`s right-hand man. He can block the Marble Screw with just his abilities, as well as many other attacks, but his fortitude isn`t as high as Gekidrago, as a direct hit will still hurt him. He first appeared on Earth in episode 19, but did not start seriously fighting the girls until episode 22. He is defeated in episode 24 but made a brief comeback in episode 25 in which he battles Pretty Cure and takes them to the Dusk Zone in a far more monstrous (and powerful) form. He is large, pale and bald with pointed ears and dark-rimmed eyes that resemble those of Kiriya. The bald head and robes make him mildly resemble Piccolo. He wears a white robe and carries a purple prism stone.",
