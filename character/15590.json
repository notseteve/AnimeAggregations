  "description" : "Even though on the Manga he shows a friendly alignment to Train and Sven`s sweeper team, in the anime, he shows a neutral attitude at the start, mainly because Eve was his target once, saved by Train. However, he develops a supporting attitude towards Train`s group as of the Eden incursion. He also has a different role, as he partakes in many missions he did not in the manga. For example, he watches the World Conference in a helicopter and is also given the mission of taking out Eve or take her to the Chronos headquarters at the start. In the Anime, he also is always accompanied by a Chronos eraser, that aids him. His relation with Lin is not of old acquaintances, as it is more strict and formal. Also, it would seem his feelings towards Rinslet are of love, even though it`s not known if he`s just a flirt.He always finds opportunity to express his feelings to Rinslet at tight situations even though they are just words. However, they are closer than they are in the Manga. In the last episode, Rinslet is talking on the phone with him.",
