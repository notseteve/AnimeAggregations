  "description" : "As a captain of the Zeon space fleet during the One Year War, Delaz chose to withdraw from A Baoa Qu, forfeiting that hopeless final battle in order to strike back at the Earth Federation later on. At his makeshift headquarters in a debris-strewn shoal zone, Delaz has spent three years gathering his forces for the master plan he calls \"Operation Stardust.\" Thanks to his strategic genius, Delaz can easily outwit the Federation`s commanders, but his idealism blinds him to the possibility of betrayal from within his own ranks.",
