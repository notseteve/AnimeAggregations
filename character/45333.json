  "description" : "An engineering student at the Frontier IV space colony, who flees with his sister and friends when the colony is attacked by the Crossbone Vanguard. At the nearby Frontier I colony, Seabook and company find refuge aboard the Federation Forces training ship Space Ark. Seabook is forced to defend the ship by piloting the prototype F91 Gundam, and his natural talent as a mobile suit pilot leads the crew to speculate that the young man is one of the Newtypes of legend. Ironically, the F91`s advanced bio-computer was designed by Seabook`s mother, whom he bitterly resents for abandoning their family to concentrate on her research work.\nSource: Official Site",
