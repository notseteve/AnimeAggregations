  "description" : "The Thousand Sunny is the second ship of the Straw Hat Pirates, and currently their primary mode of transportation after the Going Merry was destroyed. She is a brig sloop type ship designed and built by Franky with a little help from Yokozuna, Iceburg, and the remaining Galley-La foremen. Built from Adam Wood, she is a magnificent ship that is at least double the size of the Going Merry. Her features include practically all of the various requests the Straw Hats had before arriving in Water 7.\nSource: One Piece Wikia",
