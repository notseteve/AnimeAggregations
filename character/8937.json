  "description" : "Washizu (also known as Wa-san) is Ibuki`s classmate and a famous delinquent. At the beginning of the anime, Washizu was depicted as a loner, and the only friend he had was Torigaya. As the anime progressed, Washizu started being friendly to other people around him. Washizu has a crush on Ibuki, and sees Yoichi as a perverted pimp who plays around with many girls, including Ibuki. He despises him because of his misunderstanding of the relationship between Yoichi and Ibuki. However, he occasionally teams up with Yoichi to fight a common enemy.\nInstead of confessing to Ibuki, he accidentally confessed to Ibuki`s sister, Ayame, and they started acting as a comic relief of the anime. They usually think together for how they could get close to their respective love interests (Ibuki for Washizu, Yoichi for Ayame).\n\"Washizu Vision\" in the anime is Washizu`s misinterpretations of the situation, usually concerning Ibuki. They can also be Washizu`s fantasies.\nSource: Wikipedia",
