  "description" : "Akatsuki is a beautiful Assassin within the world of Elder Tale. Her secondary class is \"Tracker\", which enhances her assassin skills even further with stealth and detecting abilities. She was initially acquainted with Shiroe after having partied with him to complete quests prior to the Apocalypse albeit using a male avatar. With Shiroe`s help she switches to a more accurate female avatar; despite having the appearance of a teenager, she is a college student like Shiroe. After Shiroe helps her, she starts referring to him as her \"Master\" and joins his party, claiming that it is out of gratitude but it is later shown that she is infatuated with him. She has a violent relationship with Naotsugu because of his \"open pervertedness\" and usually resorts to pre-emptive violence to stop his perverted comments before they can be spoken.\nSource: Wiki",
