  "description" : "Takeuchi Sora is the founder of the original Sleeping Forest, the first Wind King and the main antagonist. He is a Gravity Child who wishes to find the Sky Regalia, so he spreads the initial rumor of the Regalia`s existence and creates the team for that purpose. He is generally carefree and extremely perverted, though he is later revealed to be cold and manipulative. He is eventually betrayed by Kilik, after he finds out that Sora had ulterior motives, as he wished to use the Sky Regalia to take control of the world, and had manipulated the information on the Tower. The ensuing battle and defeat leads to his loss of the Wind Regalia and the use of his legs, as well as several defections from Sleeping Forest. He continues to use a wheelchair full-time for six years while waiting for an opportune time to put his plans into motion once again.\nAs the one-time leader of Sleeping Forest, he was romantically involved with Rika, a relationship which ended following Kilik`s coup d`etat that left Sora permanently using a specially customized AT-wheelchair. Sora began to mentor Ikki at the request of Rika and in the process rekindled their shattered romance. Though initially interested in grooming Ikki into an accomplished successor, Sora soon reveals Ikki is just a means to obtain a newly finished Wind Regalia and begins implementing new plans for global dominance, although it was also said that if Ikki obtained the completed wind regalia and became the wind king, he would have been a rider not even Sora could have defeated.. This turn-of-events also brought to light numerous revelations including his AT-tuned biomechatronic legs and a twin brother, Nike.",
