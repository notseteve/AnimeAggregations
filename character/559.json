  "description" : "Togetic is a highly auspicious species. It is associated with good fortune and happiness, but it is said that it will grant its boons and affection only to kind-hearted, caring people. In fact, it will even grow sad itself if it is in mean-spirited company for a prolonged period of time. Togetic`s rudimentary wings do not permit it to actually fly, but it has in lost time learned to remain floating in midair without even using them. In the new Diamond and Pearl games, Togetic is granted an evolution, Togekiss, using the Shiny Stone.\nIn the anime, Misty`s Togepi evolves into Togetic in order to protect the Togepi indigenous to the mystical Mirage Kingdom from a villain. After peace is restored, it decides to remain there in order to watch over its fellow Pokémon and Misty releases it, parting with a Pokémon she has had for most of the series` original generation.\nTogetic later appeared in the 11th movie, Near the waters with its partner, Riolu.",
