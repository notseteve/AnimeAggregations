  "description" : "The Master Fisherman of Akala Island has been a fisherman for 40 years or maybe even 99 years. His story kept changing every time he told it. Apparently, those that want to fish for the lunker known as the Lord of the Lake in a lake near Brooklet Hill need his permission to battle it. He has \"scars\" that are badges of honor that he received in mortal combat with the Lord of the Lake though they flaked off.\nThe master fisherman required that people asserted themselves if they are qualified fishermen to try to battle the Lord of the Lake and first catch a Hinbass as proof of their skills. Lana had caught a Hinbass before he could finish explaining the requirement.\nHe had \"apparently\" been a master fisherman for 99 years and in all those years he had never seen such an amazing battle before between Lana and what ended up being a School Form Wishiwashi.",
