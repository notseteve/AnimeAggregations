  "description" : "After Thane`s Father`s Blitzle and Thane`s Father`s Patrat were too tired to battle, Thane went back to his dad and borrowed Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad so he and his friends could continue battling. Glen commanded both of the Pokémon in a double battle against Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok.\nThane attempted to help out by giving Glen advice by specifically telling him to match up Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad against Pikachu because of the type advantage but Glen wouldn`t take the advice. The inexperience of Glen and his unwillingness to accept advice proved to be the reasons that Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad lost the battle. After the battle, both of the Pokémon were given a blend of Berries and medicinal plants from Cilan in order to recover.",
