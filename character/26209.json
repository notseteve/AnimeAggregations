  "description" : "Hayashi Genzou is the owner of the apartment building where the Yamada sisters live. He is an older man who rarely smiles and appears gruff and forbidding. In his own way, he tries to look out for the Yamada sisters. They apparently remind him of his wife Eriko and his daughter Mami, who were killed in an accident involving a truck. For all that he cares about the sisters, he still will collect the full rent every month.",
