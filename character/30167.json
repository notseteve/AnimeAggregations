  "description" : "Andou Mirai is a student of Miyasaka High, despite her age. She is a lightning demon that takes on the form of a cute 14-year old girl. Initially tasked to kill http://anidb.net/ch30171 [Gekkou], she later went on to form a contract with him as she became unable to release her powers without his consent. While she is considered to be an upper-class demon of noble blood, most of her powers are usually sealed away by Gekkou and can only be reactivated with his permission, upon which her hair will turn golden and her body will be wrapped in a vortex of lightning. She is described to be excessively boisterous and annoying to Gekkou, though she is also often irritated by his apparent indifference to her existence. Her favorite pastimes are reading manga and drawing, and her favourite drink is Mr Pepper.\nSource: Wikipedia",
