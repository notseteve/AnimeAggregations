  "description" : "The stern captain of the Yamato, utterly devoted to his mission to save Earth from the Gamilas threat, even at the cost of his own life. Suffering from radiation sickness, he becomes increasingly ill during the course of the first season, but remains convinced that he will live to see his home world again. He regards Kodai Mamoru almost as a replacement for the son he lost in battle. He transfers these feelings to the younger brother Susumu, though the latter`s insubordination occasionally vexes him. Even when his illness leaves him bedridden, he remains a source of advice to the crew, and to Kodai Susumu in particular.",
