  "description" : "Hippopotas can be found in the Ruin Maniac`s cave. It is fairly rare, though will appear more often as the length of the cave increases. This Pokémon and its evolutions have quite different gender forms. The female has a brown replacing the color on the snout and on its body, while the male is a yellowish tan. Unlike the aquatic animal the Hippopotamus, which is what`s it`s loosely based on, Hippopotas lives in deserts, and hates getting wet; however, it is one of the few non-water ground type Pokémon that can learn Water Pulse.",
