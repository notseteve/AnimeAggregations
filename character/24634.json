At the age of 15 he killed his own mother and assumed her place as the Sakurazukamori, feeling no emotion as he did the deed. As she died, she prophesied that he would be killed by the one he loved the most, just as she was.\nLater in life, he develops a relationship with Sumeragi Subaru, the 13th head of the Sumeragi clan and the most powerful onmyouji in Japan.\nIn X, Seishirou becomes one of the Dragons of Earth, confronting Subaru on many occasions.\nIn Tsubasa Chronicle, he appears as a mysterious traveler who gained the ability to cross worlds from Yuuko the Dimension Witch. One of the worlds he visited long ago was the Clow Country, where he met Syaoran and taught the boy his peculiar style of fighting. He travels the dimensions, seeking the twin vampires Kamui and Subaru.",
