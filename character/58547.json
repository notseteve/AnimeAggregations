  "description" : "Marielle is a Cleric, the rather eccentric guild master of the Crescent Moon Alliance guild (which is also part of the Round Table council) and a friend of Shiroe`s. She is stronger than she looks and has a habit of hugging people so hard she slams them into walls, and her preferred victim is Naotsugu for whom she eventually becomes infatuated. She usually does this when meeting new people or greeting a friend. However, she can be very serious when required. This holds true especially when a member of her guild is in danger.\nSource: Wiki",
