  "description" : "Baby Beel`s elder brother, sent by their father to help in destroying mankind. He is a very spoiled, pompous child and a video game addict. However, he seems to be extremely powerful, on par with his brother: if he cries, he will destroy everything in a radius of 15 km in a sea of flames. He is also lazy and a crybaby, and is not as interested in destroying mankind as he is in clearing video games. Lord En seems to have a crush on Lamia and even calls her his wife, but she does not reciprocate. His juvenile canine teeth are actually fangs and the left one is slightly longer. He has green hair like his brother and is attended by three wet nurses.",
