  "description" : "The Mordred, named after the Knight of the Round Table; is a heavy-artillery Knightmare Frame piloted by Knight of Six, Anya Alstreim. It has an integrated Float System enabling flight. The Mordred exchanges speed for armor, making it highly durable; it is able to take a direct hit from the Gekka`s Katen Yaibatou without even being scratched, whereas any other Knightmare would have been sliced in half. The same cannot be said for the Float System, which can be sheared through with ease. It possesses two sets of Hadron Cannons mounted on each shoulder, which are unfolded and merged into a quad-barrel cannon called the Stark Hadron Cannon, focusing their power into a single blast capable of obliterating an aerial cruiser in a single shot.\nThe Mordred also possesses miniature proximity missiles, fired from the chest and hips, which leave purple trails behind as they move. Although lacking in close-range weapons, the Mordred`s raw strength allows it to crush other Knightmares with ease.",
