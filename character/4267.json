  "description" : "Age has the body of a seventeen-year-old boy, but is actually 120 years old; it is unknown how much of this time he was actually \"living\", as he may have been in stasis for over 100 years. Age lived on the ruined planet Oron, a world that was once verdant and peaceful, but later suffered from a cosmic cataclysm. Wild by nature, he is nevertheless extremely good-natured. Having grown up on a deserted planet, he can easily fend for himself and often hunts. His prey also seems to be a sort of pet or close friend to him (the limbs that Age eats eventually grow back). Like other Nodos, Age has shown enhanced agility and immense strength; he was able to tear the Argonaut`s outer shell with his bare hands. Since he was taught by the Golden Tribe, Age has a limited knowledge about human society, not even knowing the meaning of `numbers`, simple words, or common phrases; the Golden Tribe apparently had no use for numbers and such.",
