  "description" : "One of the MS-09G Dwadge ground combat mobile suits still in use following the One Year War is owned by \"Desert\" Rommel, leader of a band of Zeon remnants still operating in Africa. Rommel`s Dwadge is modified and upgraded over the years, and by the time of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, his mobile suit - now designated the MS-09H Dwadge Reinforcement Type - is a step above the standard model. It features extra thrusters mounted on its shoulders, and it can use a large, hand-operated beam cannon for greater firepower.\nSource: mahq.net",
