  "description" : "A brash and impatient girl who loves Yuki and is rivals with Kaede . She often beats up Kaede whenever she sees Kaede with Yuki, usually a funny sneak attack. She can be very vain at times, but helps her friends if she decides to. She`s partners (or more like partner-in-crimes) with Yashichi since Azumi wants Yuki and hates Kaede and Yashichi hates Mirumo, Kaede`s fairy friend. But most of the time, she leaves Yashichi to do her household chores and treats him like a slave, but seems to have a soft spot for him. She also has a younger brother but is rarely seen. At the near end of anime season four, Azumi challenged Kaede to know who really is the right one for Yuki. Kaede wins at the end of the battle. Azumi accepted her loss but warned Kaede and said that \"if she starts doing the wrong thing again, she will never let Kaede take that chance again.\" In the manga, after she broke up with Yuki, she went dating with Sumita and Hirai but failed, and she is the idol of Sasuke and Hanzo.",
