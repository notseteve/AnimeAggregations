  "description" : "Corphish is not indigenous to the Hoenn region, but to a landmass overseas. It was introduced to Hoenn as an exotic pet, but the species ended up familiarising itself so much that it now forms part of the local ecosystem. It`s unknown where it is native from. Corphish is a hardy and durable Pokémon; it can thrive almost under any condition. It can make its nest even in polluted water, and it will make a meal out of anything available, taking the term omnivore to extremes.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Corphish is one of the Pokémon that Ash has in his traveling team for the duration of Hoenn and the entire Battle Frontier challenge in Kanto. Corphish is friendly, but does not realize its own strength; it often ends up flinging Ash away while expressing its affection to him. Corphish is also short-tempered, and often tries to instigate a fight when peaceful solutions exist, and also gets jealous when one of Ash`s Pokémon evolve, since it wants Ash`s attention.",
