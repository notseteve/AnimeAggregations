  "description" : "Sawyer`s Treecko battled against Clemont`s Luxray at the Lumiose Gym. Only the end of the battle was shown where it was defeated by Clemont`s Luxray. Clemont explained that its Razor Leaf`s timing was just a moment too late and gave him the chance to counterattack.\nWhile waiting for Serena and Bonnie to look at the clothes at the Laverre Gym, Ash challenged Sawyer to a battle and the two decided on a Double Battle which featured Ash`s Frogadier and Ash`s Hawlucha VS Sawyer`s Bagon and Sawyer`s Treecko. Despite a type advantage, Ash`s battles are unpredictable because he negates type disadvantages like they are nothing and due to this and Sawyer`s lack of Double Battle experience, Ash easily won the match. He was grateful to battle though and gain the experience.\nSawyer`s Grovyle is the evolved form of Sawyer`s Treecko. It evolved in a battle against Ash where it also learned Leaf Blade.",
