  "description" : "Hazuki is quiet and serious, with long dark blue hair and sharp blue eyes. Hazuki appears cold and unfriendly and is fiercely protective of Hatsumi. She is actually very vulnerable and romantic, even to the point of being submissive, but refuses to show weakness or depend on anyone but her adoptive sister, Hatsumi â€” unless she is forced to. One example of this is her first encounter with Lilith, where she initially refuses Lilith`s help in looking for Hatsumi/Eve. Only when Lilith notes she won`t be able to travel from world to world without her, does Hazuki agree to travel with her and even then, only tacitly. As soon as she no longer has any need for Lilith`s help, she shows no regard for her or her wishes with regards to Eve. Hazuki idolizes Hatsumi extremely and, as such, considers her sexual attraction to Hatsumi vulgar and shameful.",
