  "description" : "Seel are well suited to life in the most frigid reaches of the planet. They are nocturnal; in the daytime they are seen asleep on the seabed in shallow water. When hunting, Seel stay in the ocean because they cannot walk on land. Instead, they swim in a rather graceful fashion literally underneath sheets of ice floating on the water`s surface in their environment in search of their prey. Even though the air is a frigid 14 degrees Fahrenheit and the water itself is a somewhat less chilling 40 degrees, their fur hides are thick enough to insulate Seel from either degree of cold and their nostrils automatically close by themselves to ensure their ability to remain underwater. When they need to take in air, they will use their hard horns to punch holes through the ice sheet above and pop their heads out.",
