  "description" : "Zubat are a basic bat Pokémon species found commonly in the wild in most caves in all the regions of the Pokémon world. In caves and other dark places it navigates using ultrasonic waves. It appears that Zubat is weakened by sunlight, so it hides in caves or other dark places. At night, it will come out and hunt for fruit or Venomoth, or it sucks blood. The female`s fangs are smaller than the male`s.\nIn the anime, Brock catches a Zubat before entering Mt. Moon. Since then it has evolved to Golbat and then into Crobat. Crobat was given to Forest, with Onix and Geodude by Brock, becoming a Gym Leader.",
