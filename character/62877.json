  "description" : "in the game \"The World\", BlackRose is a female Heavy Blade character who meets Kite in the video game series. BlackRose is just starting on her adventure at the same time as Kite (though this is a fact she attempts to hide when they initially meet). The two clash immediately, but warm up to each other little by little. She reveals that her purpose for joining is to find a cure for the data bug that placed her brother in a coma. BlackRose is a young woman with a tough-as-nails attitude and can be a bit full of herself at times. Luckily, she has Kite alongside her to balance her out and keep her in check. In the anime .hack//Gift and .hack//Unison BlackRose is shown to have a sort of rivalry with Mimiru another heavy blade who shares a similar avatar. Her real name is Hayami Akira and is a member of the tennis team at her high school.",
