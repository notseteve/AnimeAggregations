  "description" : "A Reasoner who uses her status `above` the common Gambee pilots to interfere when justice is needed. She has a sharp mind and a wide network of friends, the closest of which are called the Space Squadron, of whom she is Queen; she is most often seen with Jessie. Lottie is determined to have her Space Squadron fight together as a team, and she tries various plans to convince Sara to cooperate in this as the series goes on. However, before Sara becomes a willing member of her team, which Lottie describes as \"as close as family, partners in life and death,\" Lottie must realise that she, too, should work as a team member instead of a dictator.",
