  "description" : "A fourteen year old girl with sleepy-looking eyes and a large scarf who is actually a well-reputed hitman with the name \"Guillotine\", who kills with knives. She appears to have somewhat supernatural strength, being able to carve pavement and metal railings into pieces with just one stroke using a butter knife. Much like Yuuno Houzuki, her family Kirishima is also part of the thirteen Inner Families, descendants of assassins. Her male name indicates she is the direct descendant of the head family. While her personality is somewhat passive, weak to heat and cold, and with a somewhat unintentional lecherous reaction to events, such as assuming Shinkurou wanted a threesome with herself and Murasaki after rescuing her from a fight, or pressing his hand against her chest to prove she was a girl, her personality can change dramatically when she has any sort of knife in her hand. Not long after her first interaction with Shinkurou and Murasaki, she develops a crush on him, and slowly makes the effort to make friends within their circle.",
