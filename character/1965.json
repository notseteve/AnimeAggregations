  "description" : "Smart, attractive, athletic and talented, Yukino Miyazawa had made herself to appear to be the model student. Both her male and female peers express their admiration for her, often asking her for help and commenting about her model features and characteristics. Her \"perfect\" exterior is a fa√ßade to hide the fact that everything she does is done solely to receive praise from others, and that she acts slovenly at home. She is a self-professed \"queen of vanity\", having been that way ever since childhood when her parents would praise her for the slightest actions. Yukino once practiced playing her recorder and almost vomiting blood from staying up all night practising. With so much praise, however, she never realized that she never had any real friends aside from her family, and was considered by her peers as a semi-approachable \"guest\". This all changes when Yukino meets Soichiro Arima, another model student who beats her high school entrance exam score, and is even more popular and athletic than Yukino.",
