  "description" : "Charjabug is a dual-type Bug/Electric Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Grubbin starting at level 20 and evolves into Vikavolt when leveled up in a special magnetic field.\nCharjabug is a small, cuboid Pokémon resembling an insect. Its body consists of three square segments with two brown stubs on each side. The last two sections have a thin, ring-like marking on each side. Its face has square blue eyes, which sometimes have sweeping green lights inside. Two short, yellow spikes extend from the front square: one on each side of its rectangular mouth. The mouth itself is gray and has two jaws that close sideways, shaped like a lightning bolt when open.\nCharjabug creates and stores electricity in its body by digesting food. This energy is stored in an electric sac. The electricity it stores could run a household for a whole day, and can be shared with other Pokémon. This Pokémon stays immobile as it prepares for its evolution, and is often half-buried in the earth.",
