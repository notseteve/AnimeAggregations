  "description" : "Pochi is an alligator which belongs to Mitsuki and the reason Izumi and Mitsuki ran away from home. Originally, Pochi`s parents lived at Mitsuki and Izumi`s home. However, one of the alligators attacked Mitsuki, causing Mitsuki`s father to have the alligators taken away and put down. Mitsuki finds an egg belonging to Pochi`s parents, and discovers that she was partly responsible for what happened to Pochi`s parents. Pochi is one of the reasons why Izumi and Mitsuki stay at Yoshitaka`s mansion because Mitsuki will not go anywhere without a spot for Pochi. Pochi likes cute girls and often tries to rape Izumi. He strongly dislikes males.\nNote: Pochi is often used to name reptiles as if they were domesticated pets such as pet dogs, similar to the name Spot in western society.",
