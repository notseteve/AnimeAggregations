  "description" : "He works for the Mauser Church as a heretical procurator. This means he will \"take away\" those whom have a faith other than the Mauser faith.\nHe especially likes the traveling part of his job due to food and bathing (hot springs), which church pays for.\nCurrently he is looking for the Scrapped Princess, but he isn`t too optimistic to find her given the poor clues provided (girl with blonde hair and blue eyes) as they match too many people.\nRaquel and Pacifica thinks he looks similar to their dead dad.",
