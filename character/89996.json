  "description" : "Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia is http://anidb.net/ch88735 [Saber of Black]`s Master and an first-class alchemist.\nGordes comes from the Musik house, which once boasted a skill with alchemy which rivaled the Einzberns. Their thaumaturgical blood had eventually decayed enough that they were forced to fold themselves into the ranks of Yggdmillennia. It was shameful for such a once-famed house to have been absorbed by another, so Gordes` mother and father constantly told him of their legacy as alchemists from his youth. At the age of thirty-six, he is unable to separate dream from reality, having been raised to be proud of his family`s former legacy.\nSource: Wikipedia",
