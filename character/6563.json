  "description" : "A member of the tennis club at school, Terai has little athletic ability. However, with http://anidb.net/ch6559 [Dobashi]`s assistance, he manages to become a somewhat decent athlete. During that time, he has fallen for Dobashi, but due to her (inadvertent) teasing, plus the fact that she avoided holding hands with him (to which she revealed that she found it embarrasing to do so), he is unsure of their relationship.",
