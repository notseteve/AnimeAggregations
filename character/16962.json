  "description" : "Mimi is http://anidb.net/ch16960 [Rin]`s assistant. It is hinted throughout the series that they also have a more intimate relationship, though in episode four, she appears to have grown close to the second informant. Also an immortal, Mimi has a bright personality and is fond of alcoholic drinks despite having the appearance of someone in her late teens. Her job scope includes financial management, information processing, and other miscellaneous tasks. She cares for Rin very much and would do anything to ensure her safety, even while nagging her to do the job properly. She feels indebted to Rin as Rin saved her from being devoured by an angel during their first encounter and has been protecting her ever since. She is a formidable hacker but is outmatched by Katsuyuki Kamiyama in episode four. After Rin disappears in episode four, she leaves with Genta and becomes a Buddhist nun. In episode six, believing there still being a chance that Rin is still alive, Mimi constantly displays her resolve in rescuing Rin from http://anidb.net/ch17293 [Apo]`s sadistic scheme.",
