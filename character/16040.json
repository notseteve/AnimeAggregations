  "description" : "Juda is the successor of Nanto Koukakuken (\"South Star Crimson Crane Fist\"), a style specializing in long range attacks.\nRepresenting the Star of Enchantment, also known as the Star of Betrayal, Juda declares himself to be the strongest and most beautiful of fighters, willing to betray his own subordinates for his own self-gain. Juda trained alongside Rei while they were still learning Nanto Seiken and became envious that Rei`s elegant fighting style was given more recognition than his own among his peers. Seeking to avenge Mamiya`s honor (who was once part of Juda`s harem of female slaves), Rei challenges Juda to a match. After being defeated by Rei, Juda concedes that Rei is the more beautiful of the two and admits that he secretly admired Rei before dying.",
