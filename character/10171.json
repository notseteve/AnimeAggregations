  "description" : "Yoki is, when first introduced, a corrupt member of the military who imposes heavy taxes on the town of Youswell, bankrupting its citizens. When the Elric brothers arrive in town, they trick Yoki into giving up ownership of the town and promptly report his actions to the military. He is stripped of his rank and lives as a homeless person on the outskirts of Central, where he meets the fugitive http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar].\nIn the 2003 anime, Yoki alerts the military to Scar`s location, and in the subsequent raid to apprehend Scar he is killed by http://anidb.net/ch6591 [Lust].\nIn the manga, Yoki is forced to work for Scar under the threat of death. Though he tries to convince those they encounter that Scar is his servant, Yoki does as Scar commands and calls him \"master\". Since he has started following Scar around the country, Yoki has assumed a role as comic relief, often having pain inflicted upon him when he tries to seem superior to others. In Chapter 93, Yoki manages to hit Pride with http://anidb.net/ch14594 [Kimblee]`s car buying http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse] and http://anidb.net/ch16466 [Heinkel] some much needed time to escape. His reason for doing this was because everyone else \"gets all the cool parts\".",
