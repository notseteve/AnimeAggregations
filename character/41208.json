  "description" : "Glen is an aspiring Pokémon Trainer who got the idea that he and his friends Thane and Nick should have a Pokémon battle together. He almost forced Thane to get his father`s Pokémon so they could have the battle. Glen is always a bit pushy and he has sudden ideas and makes sudden demands.\nIn the first battle against Thane, Glen pushed Thane`s Father`s Patrat and Thane`s Father`s Blitzle to the point of exhaustion before he finally decided to stop the battle. He then told Thane to get some more of his fathers Pokémon so they could continue battling. Not wanting to disappoint Glen or make him mad, Thane went to go get them and Glen went to go look for Nick who had shown them Pikachu earlier and had initially wanted to battle.\nDouble Battle against Nick\nAfter Thane`s Father`s Blitzle and Thane`s Father`s Patrat were too tired to battle, Thane went back to his dad and borrowed Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad so he and his friends could continue battling. Glen commanded both of the Pokémon in a double battle against Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok.\nThane attempted to help out by giving Glen advice by specifically telling him to match up Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad against Pikachu because of the type advantage but Glen wouldn`t take the advice. The inexperience of Glen and his unwillingness to accept advice proved to be the reasons that Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad lost the battle.\nNick won the double battle and he was quite moved to have participated in a simulated Pokémon battle. He fought against Glen the best that he could but Glen got a bit upset that he lost. Ash made Glen apologize and the two of them continued to be friends. Glen and his friends hoped to have another Pokémon battle someday against each other. After watching the Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok battle each other, Glen was even more moved to become a Pokémon Trainer someday.",
