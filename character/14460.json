  "description" : "The Amoeba Boys made their debut appearance in episode 7. Despite their name, they are two males and one female. They were three ordinary amoebas before they were hit by one of the black lights. The Amoeba Boys wish to be real criminals, but like their original counterparts, they are unsuccessful, with their size, about the size of a persons foot, being the primary reason for their constant failure as well as their own incompetence. They also have the ability to merge and grow into a giant yellow amoeba that, despite its size, is too weak to cause any real damage. The Amoeba Boys, like Mojo, have yet to have the reversion ray used on them, and are unique in that they are the only villains to date who have never been captured by the girls.",
