  "description" : "Nyanta is a werecat Swashbuckler. He was the former Chief of the Debauchery Tea Party and an old friend of Shiroe`s. His subclass is chef, which allows him to make delicious foods using ingredients, which is quite a reprieve from the tasteless pre-made food that is offered in Elder Tale, and ends up being an important plot point. Before the Apocalypse he was part of a guild called \"The Cat Food Guild\", which was composed solely of cat people. It has since been disbanded since their house caved in due to bad weather.\nSource: Wiki",
