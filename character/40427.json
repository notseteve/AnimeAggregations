  "description" : "Bianca`s Father was first mentioned in BW13 by Bianca and she said that she had been studying at home for a while before starting her journey because her father wouldn`t allow her to start. He was first seen by Ash and his friends as they entered the Raimon City gym where he was waiting for his daughter Bianca. He was concerned that Bianca might be in danger and he regretted giving her permission to start her journey. Bianca`s Father is a loving father and just wants the best for his daughter. Initial impressions of him suggested he was a bit over protective but with Bianca`s clumsy nature, he just wanted to make sure he looked after her.\nWhile he was young, he traveled on his on Pokémon journey. He was called the \"Red Shooting Star\" and he still continues to wears a large red scarf while battling.\nAsh challenged Bianca`s Father to a Pokémon battle to allow Bianca to continue to travel. He agreed but changed the challenge to force Ash to return home to Pallet Town if he lost the battle. Even though Bianca`s Father`s Darmanitan only used Fire type moves throughout the battle, it proved to be too strong for Ash`s Oshawott. Bianca`s Father commented though that his Red Flash Hihidaruma gets more fired up the more resistance it faces and shortly after it knocked Ash`s Oshawott out. Despite loosing the battle, Bianca`s Father changed his mind because the battle with Ash and his Mijumaru made him remember the joy of traveling. Thankful that her father changed his mind, Bianca raced off to the Desert Resort to train but forgot her bag while required Bianca`s Father to go chasing after her.",
