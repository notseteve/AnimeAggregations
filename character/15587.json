  "description" : "Belze Rochefort in the manga\nBelze is the Chronos Numbers member Number II. Sephiria has trusted him since Train left the Chronos Numbers. His weapon is a spear named \"Gungnir.\" While Belze is Sephiria`s right hand man and second in command of the Numbers, it is worth noting that the rest of the Numbers` hierarchy don`t seem to follow a strict order. It has been stated in Belze`s profile page from the manga though that the Number I represents Commanding Officer and II represents Vice Commander.\nBelze Rochefort in the anime\nThere is no noted difference between Belze in the anime and in the manga, except he didn`t battle Kyoko or Charden.",
