She had been trying to help her Denryu perfect its ThunderPunch when Ash and his friends stopped by the ranch.\nTokuzo wanted to trade in Ellie`s Ampharos at a Pok√©mon Trade Meet in the neighboring town but Ellie knew that her Denryu was doing its best and asked to let her watch it a bit longer to help it improve. Her faith in Denryu proved to be well placed as Ellie`s Ampharos fought off Team Rocket and protected the Merriep from being stolen.\nTokuzo makes a very good soup that Ash and his friends all enjoyed. Ash liked it so much that he wanted a second cup.",
