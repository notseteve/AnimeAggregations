  "description" : "Korone is a Liladan, a type of android, sent by the Imperial government to observe Sai Akuto at all times. Usually, she is emotionless and stolid, however, also she seems to enjoy teasing Akuto and frequently does perverted things to him. She sleeps in a closet in Akuto`s dorm room, and carries a magical handbag containing implausibly large weapons and other useful items. Like all Liladans, she has a small rabbit-like tail which deactivates her when pulled.",
