  "description" : "Lucky Ollietta is an 18-year-old mage who uses wood-based magic, and can instantly reshape wood into a form of her choice. Due to this ability, she helped a lot with the rebuilding of the Fairy Tail Guild after it was vandalized by the Phantom Lord Guild. She likes glasses and wears them as well, and she has a dislike for perverts. Lucky also has funny ways of expressing herself, for example she refers to getting a haircut as \"chopping hair\", eating as \"feeding your stomach\", and sleeping as \"whittling away the defenseless hours\".",
