  "description" : "Hiroshi is a normal boy and the main character of the story. His family moved to Jyougamachi due reasons relating to his father`s line of work. The kanji for his name can also be read as \"Professor\", so many people call him Hakase as a nickname. Hiroshi isn`t fond of this nickname because it makes people believe that he`s some kind of a genius, which is far from the truth. Despite this, he still allows Kaname to call him by it.",
