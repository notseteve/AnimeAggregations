  "description" : "Korrina`s Mienfoo was the first Pok√©mon to face Ash Ketchum in his gym battle against Korrina. It was matched up against Ash`s Hawlucha. Kojofu`s movements were so precise that initially the rhythm dancing battling technique did not work very well against it. When Ash Ketchum finally realized that the rhythm strategy worked because it was Tierno who was using it and switched to their own rhythm that the battle changed. Ash`s Hawlucha was able to battle back and defeat Korrina`s Mienfoo.",
