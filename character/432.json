  "description" : "Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon. The \"sea\" in Seaking`s name refers to the fact that it is a water-inhabiting Pokemon. \"King\" is probably a reference to its unevolved form`s name, Goldeen (a portmanteau of \"gold\" and \"queen\"). Hence, its name means \"king of the sea.\" Its Japanese name refers to Azumanishiki (東錦) for one kind of \"goldfish\" and Ou (王) for \"king\". Seaking was originally called Neptune in the beta. Seaking is a goldfish Pokemon with a sharp horn, much like a narwhal. It uses the horn for boring holes in a rock for its nest. In spawning season, they can be seen swimming up rivers and streams.",
