  "description" : "Eiji is Ono`s apprentice, as well as other help in the kitchen. He is a former street punk who was picked up off the street and reformed by a boxing coach. He trained to be a boxer, and was a top fighter. However, due to his detached retinas, he had to give up boxing. He saw a \"Help Wanted\" ad in the bakery`s window, and decided to join. He has a huge sweet tooth. He holds Ono in very high regard, calling him his \"Master\", due to his skill in making sweets. Over time they have developed more of a father-son relationship than that of a master and apprentice.",
