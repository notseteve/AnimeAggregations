He refers to Angelique as \"Angelique-sama\" (Lady Angelique).\nHe is often seen practicing his spear skills during his free time outside the Mansion. At the end of the first season, Angelique gave him an \"order\" that in future, he was to simply call her Angelique as she felt that they were friends. Hyuuga has a hard time trying to say Angelique`s name without saying it in a formal form in the beginning.\nIn Season 2 he suffers from seasickness but eventually overcomes it.\nHe wields a spear in battle against Thanatos.\nSource: Wiki",
