  "description" : "A student at Kashima high school and has been Hazumu`s classmate since their first year of high school. Ever since she was born, Yasuna has had a unique affliction which makes her incapable of seeing males, and instead to her males are covered in a grey, hazy blur, which makes it extremely difficult for her to tell one male apart from another except through the sound of their voice. Due to this, she was never able to get along well with others; on top of not being able to see the boys in her class at school, the girls who would normally interact with them were different compared to Yasuna, which built up a divide between her and everyone else. She ended up staying alone for years, and she thought she did not mind it; she did not intend to befriend anyone anyway. However, when she stumbled across Hazumu one day in her first year of high school, she was shocked to find that she could see most of him clearly, though his face was still a blur.",
