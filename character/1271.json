  "description" : "Dialga, known as the Temporal Pok√©mon, is described as an ancient deity of the Sinnoh region with the ability to control time. It is part of the Legendary Dragon trio, along with Palkia and Giratina. According to Sinnoh-region lore, it was created by Arceus, at which point time began to flow. It has a long neck, short tail and a thick set of legs with sharp, metal claws. It has many silver protrusions resembling spikes along the back of its neck, on its head, on its top rear, and on its chest. Lodged into the chest protrusions is a glowing blue, diamond-like jewel. Running along its body are light blue lines that fluctuate into diamond shapes. Its signature move is \"Roar of Time\".\nDialga is only obtainable in Diamond, in the same way that Palkia is only obtainable in Pearl. It is summoned by the defeated leader of Team Galactic, Cyrus, who hopes to have it create a new universe for him, at the Spear Pillar on top of Mt. Coronet. It is stopped by Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, which nullifiy its power, and can be captured or defeated by the player.",
