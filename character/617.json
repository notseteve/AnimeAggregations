  "description" : "Pineco is a bagworm that resembles a pine cone in appearance. It is usually inactive, hanging from forest trees, where it waits for its prey of small flying insects to come to it. Pineco are capable of spitting out a sticky liquid that hardens when exposed to air. This has multiple uses, an example being Pineco using it to glue pieces of bark to themselves for protection, making them bigger and their hide more durable, much like the bagworm in real life. Like Voltorb and Electrode, Pineco explodes when startled or annoyed.\nIn the Pok√©mon anime, Brock catches a Pineco in the episode Goin` Apricorn! to save it from Jessie`s Arbok. It often exploded, no matter what its mood was, but it lost this habit later on when it evolved into a Forretress.",
