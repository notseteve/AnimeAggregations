  "description" : "Shirahama Honoka is Ken`ichi`s sister and cares for her brother deeply. She is constantly interrupting Ken`ichi`s training sessions, fearing he may get hurt, and constantly yells at his opponent, most often Miu, who she calls Big Boobs. She appears to have a vengeance with Miu, and is often insulting her. She later appears to warm up to her a little, but still calls her by her nickname. The second time she visits the Ryouzanpaku dojo, she shows Shigure and Apachai how to properly make tea, which impresses them. She soon becomes good friends with Shigure and Apachai and visits the dojo regularly to play with them. Honoka is an extremely talented Othello player, often playing against and defeating Apachai and Tanimoto.\nShe befriends Tanimoto Natsu after he saves her from some thugs, and he saves her when Loki kidnaps her.",
