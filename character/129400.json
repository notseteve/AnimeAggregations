  "description" : "The Wild Area Ingredient Seller approached Ash Ketchum and Goh`s campsite. Dropping his huge backpack, he told them if they needed help with food, that he was there to help! He overheard them talking about the Thwackey that hit the Pok√© Ball back at Goh and told them that the Thwackey had been seen in the area a lot lately. The Thwackey apparently are constantly foraging for food from campers and it was where he came in to the picture and he dropped of supplies for them to cook another curry.",
