  "description" : "Andrew \"Andy\" Waltfeld was the commander of the ZAFT forces in the PLANT-pledged African Community, headquartered at Banadiya. He lives with his lover Aisha who assists him in his military operations and eventually serves as the co-pilot of his TMF/A-803 LaGOWE. Unlike other ZAFT and Earth Alliance officers, he is surprisingly human and well aware of the repercussions of war. After forcing Kira Yamato to battle him in their gundams, Andrew and Aisha are seemingly killed in the explosion. Andrew is later seen alive having been saved by Aisha and losing his left eye, left arm and right leg in the process. He assists the Archangel`s goal in ending the war. His character draws heavily from http://anidb.net/ch77678 [Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel], a WWII German field marshal known as the Desert Fox.",
