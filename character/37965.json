He fights using Bruce Lee`s incredibly versatile Jeet Kune Do style, allowing him a few of Bruce Lee`s actual techniques that he chose to perfect during his lifetime. The most important aspect of Jacky`s game are his combos, which can be utilised to repeatedly strike and inflict massive damage. He also seems to have a brash and confident attitude.\nThe eldest son of the Bryant family, Jacky is Sarah`s older brother. He maintains his cool in every situation. Those on the Indy racing circuit call him the Blue Flash. Jacky was seriously injured in an accident in the 1990 Indianapolis 500, and spent two years in a gruelling rehabilitation program. Just when his injury had healed, he discovered the existence of the mystery group behind the accident. At the same time, his sister Sarah disappeared. Jacky`s battle began as he pursued the trail of the group who held the key to these mysteries.",
