  "description" : "Fujiwara Yumeji is the main character of Yumekui Merry. Student in high school, he received 10 years ago the ability to perceive the aura of people`s dreams, which allows him to predict what kind of dreams they are going to have. He is a lazy, yet strong-willed and determined person with a heart of gold, who is always ready to help others. He is also a member of a writing club at his high school, and is a big fan of the superhero called Guricho. He meets Merry when she falls on top of him as he comes back from his errands, and together, they enter a daydream - basically, a dream that occurs in full daylight. He is firmly decided to help Merry to come back in the Dreamworld, even if she is not convinced at the beginning, but they soon end up becoming very good friends.",
