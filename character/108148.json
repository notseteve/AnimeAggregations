  "description" : "When Ash and Go were visiting the Bell Tower in Ecruteak City to see if they could spot Ho-oh, they discover a Pokémon that resembles Ho-oh as soon as they arrive and Pikachu uses Thunderbolt to knock it out of the sky! The two are overjoyed, but it turns out that Ho-oh is just a fake; and it was Kurio who had disguised his own Pokémon. Kurio told them that he wants to show Ho-oh to his grandpa no matter what and that`s why he disguised it. It befriended Pikachu and Go`s Scorbunny and they climbed up the tower but in the end, only his Jiei managed to see the real Ho-oh fly by.",
