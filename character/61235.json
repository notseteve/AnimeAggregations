  "description" : "Platinum the Trinity is a young girl with three personalities named Luna, Sena, and Trinity Glassfield. Luna is a rude young girl; Sena is a polite young boy; and Trinity is the spirit of one of the Six Heroes. Trinity`s personality is locked within her Nox Nyctores, and she is only able to come to the surface for brief periods of time. This Nox Nyctores` full name is Arma Reboare: Muchourin, a bell which has the power to incarnate matter. Platinum normally prefers to avoid violence and lives in the ruins of Ibukido, but came to Kagutsuchi on Jubei`s request in order awaken Bang`s Nox Nyctores. Platinum is very fond of Jubei; however she harbors a deep hate towards Ragna, apparently because of jealously towards his friendly relationship with Jubei.\nSource: Wiki",
