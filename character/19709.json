  "description" : "Genesis is a massive team under the command of Simca. It is a conglomeration of numerous teams that have united under one banner, resulting in what is known to be the largest and most powerful team in history. It is originally presented by Simca as a tool to overthrow the idea of the Trophaeum, though it is later shown to be a creation of Nike to obtain the Sky Regalia along with Sora. Simca attempts to intervene by having Ikki become the Wind King and take control of Genesis, though the two brothers stop the plan.",
