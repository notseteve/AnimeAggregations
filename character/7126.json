  "description" : "Aki Hinata, is the single mother of Fuyuki and Natsumi Hinata and is the head of the family that Keroro lives with. Her exact age is unknown; however, she is believed to be around 35 years old. Whether it is supporting a family of three on her own, or making late night runs to the printing press on her trusty motorcycle, or kicking aliens around every few weeks, it is common belief (at least to the Keronians) that Hinata Aki is the strongest woman on Earth. Despite her fear of animals, she feels as though the Keroro Platoon is her own family (due entirely to them being shiny and possibly slimy, as opposed to the furry nature of most animals). As a chief manga editor/designer, she finds the aliens` lifestyle very interesting and often has spells of obsession over them.\nWhile Aki has no official Keronian partner (as none of the adults do), it is Kururu who has taken a special interest in her, to the extent of setting up a spy camera in her shower. Whether this is for the purposes of studying `the most powerful human on Earth` or for the same reasons anyone would spy on her in the shower remains to be seen.",
