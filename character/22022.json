  "description" : "He is the ruler of the Gastark Empire and a powerful warrior. He like Sion dislike the idea of waging war, and tries to reduce casualities as much as possible, as he believes there is no other way to prevent war, than waging war itself. He eventually meets Kiefer, in a battle against Stohl, and shows a liking for her, after she tried to protect two defenseless children, and eventually invites her to his side, to which she declines for the moment. He possesses the Rule Fragment known as Glouvil, which is a large one bladed sword, which upon sacrificing something, grants him great destructive powers that can easily surpass those of a large-scale spell. So far he has sacrificed his right leg, sense of smell, and his left eye for this.",
