  "description" : "This large aircraft carrier, commanded by the capable Captain Todaka, is the flagship of the Orb expeditionary fleet. The Takemikazuchi uses the same trimaran construction as Orb`s distinctive Aegis ships, and it can carry large numbers of mobile suits on its two-level deck. Its six catapults are used for launching Murasame mobile suits in fighter form, while its complement of M1 Astray Shrikes simply use their hovering capabilities to take off from the upper deck.",
