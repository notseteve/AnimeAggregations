  "description" : "Saint-Germi is a nobleman and http://anidb.net/ch86429 [Drifter] who owns a quarter of the http://anidb.net/ch86431 [Orte Empire] and was Hitler`s closest ally in its formation. It is said that the Empire could not have existed without his \"betrayal\", and as such, he is free to live as he pleases without criticism from any of his peers. Despite this position, however, he is not loyal to the Empire and later betrays the Empire when he realizes its impending demise.\nHe forms an alliance with the Drifters and their allies to take over the Empire. In spite of the fact he is well over fifty years old, Saint-Germi appears as a youthful drag queen with an effeminate personality. He has knowledge of the modern era (due to the fact that he is aware of the existence of firearms and gunpowder), as well as some knowledge of Japanese history.\nSource: Wikipedia",
