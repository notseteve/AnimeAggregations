  "description" : "When she was a child, a Yoma made her part of its disguise and its toy, often torturing her. The Yoma is killed by Teresa. Empathising with Teresa`s pain, Clare follows her for days without rest, food, or water. Teresa, after at first trying to get rid of Clare, eventually lets her travel with her, and the two became attached. The presence of a caring human in her life helps Teresa regain her lost happiness and humanity. Their life together is cut short when Teresa kills some human bandits to save Clare`s life. The organisation sends four of their best Claymores to execute Teresa, who is eventually killed by the awakened Priscilla.\nClare is ranked #47, the lowest number, among the Claymores.\nClare possesses the flesh and blood of Teresa, which she requested this be her Yoma when she volunteered to become a Claymore. Thus Clare is not a normal Claymore (half-human half-demon) but only 1/4 demon and 3/4 human.",
