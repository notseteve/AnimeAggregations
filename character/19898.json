  "description" : "Zangya is a character who appeared in the Dragon Ball Z movie, Bojack Unbound. She is an alien with long curly orange hair and pointed ears. Her name is derived from the Japanese word zangyaku, which means \"cruelty\" or \"brutality\".\nIn Bojack Unbound, Zangya fought Krillin at his battle zone, which was full of lava. She easily defeated him. Later, Gohan and the other Z Fighters fought Zangya and the rest of Bojack`s henchmen.\nAfter Gohan killed Bujin and Bido, Zangya backed away in fear. Then Bojack attempted to distract Gohan by pushing Zangya in front of him and shooting an energy blast through her at Gohan, killing Zangya.",
