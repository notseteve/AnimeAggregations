  "description" : "Skitty is a basic Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Skitty is a \"cute\" Pokémon, according to the Pokédex. It loves things that it can chase. Some times it even chases its own tail. Many people in the Pokémon world have them as pets.\nIn the Pokémon anime, trainer May has a Skitty that she uses for Contests. It can juggle and perform a variety of attacks, for which it also is useful in battle, when it is not chasing its own tail. May`s Skitty (like Jessie`s Wobbuffet, Misty`s Psyduck and Brock`s Croagunk) has a knack for coming out of its Poké Ball at some inappropriate moments, which may make May`s opponent think it`s her next battle Pokémon.\nIn Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team, Skitty is one of the sixteen available starter Pokémon.Skitty is also playable in the game`s sequel and is one of three normal types.(the others being Meowth and Munchlax)",
