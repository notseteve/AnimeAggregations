  "description" : "The First High School Disciplinary Committee is a discipline-upholding organization within http://anidb.net/ch67045 [First High School] and one of the three most important student organizations in First High, alongside the http://anidb.net/ch67046 [Student Council] and the http://anidb.net/ch67048 [Extracurricular Activities Federation]. The Disciplinary Committee`s job is to maintain order, enforce school rules, and uphold discipline within the campus; to that effect, committee members enjoy special rights, including carrying their CADs within the school.\nThe committee has nine members, out of which three are assigned by the faculty, three are nominated by the Student Council, and three by the Extracurricular Activities Federation; one of those members is chosen as the chairperson in an internal election. Disciplinary Committee membership has no set term, meaning students stay until they graduate, choose to leave, or have their appointment retracted.",
