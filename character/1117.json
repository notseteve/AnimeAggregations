  "description" : "Kyou is a bad-mouthed and aggressive girl who is also well known as a good cook. She is the older of the Fujibayashi twins. She was in Tomoya`s class in their second year, and has maintained a steady friendship with Tomoya even though they are put in different classes on their third year. She is currently the class representative of her class. She has a pet baby boar named Botan. She even has her own motorbike (in this case a scooter), which is known only to Tomoya and her sister, as Kyou does not want the news of her possession of it to be known, as she fears suspension from school because she is not allowed to ride a motorbike to school. Her favourite weapon is various types of dictionaries, which are thrown at anyone she gets furious with, typically Youhei. In the anime, Kyou uses various books as weapons more often, and while Tomoya almost always avoids them, Youhei gets hit almost every single time.",
