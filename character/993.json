  "description" : "Grumpig wields powerful psychic powers. It uses the valuable black pearls on its body to harness and amplify its psychic powers. It can gain control over the movements and actions of its foes by expulsing psychic waves upon them, hence its designation as the Manipulate Pok√©mon. It appears to grow tired as it does this; its nose-snorting grows loud and tired-sounding. It dances bizarrely when using its psychic energy. Its style of dancing is hugely popular in many foreign countries. It is also capable of bouncing extraordinary heights with its spring-like tail, which it inherited from its younger evolutionary stage, Spoink.",
