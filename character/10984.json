  "description" : "Mito (ミト) is the woman who raised Gon and does not want him to become a Hunter. Despite being Ging`s cousin, Gon refers to her as his aunt and considers her his \"real mom.\" Although Mito never told Gon that Ging was a Hunter, he grew up believing both his parents died in a car accident, the boy learned about it from Kite three years prior to the series. She later reveals to him that ten years after Ging left Whale Island, he returned with Gon as an infant and asked their grandmother to take care of him for a while, but Mito felt him unfit to parent and gained custody of the boy.\nSource: Wikipedia",
