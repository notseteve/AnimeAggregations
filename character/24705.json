  "description" : "The Ballam Alliance is a guild alliance between three out of the four most powerful Dark Guilds in the kingdom of Fiore. At the moment, four powerful legal guilds in Fiore are trying to stop them from completing their current goals. They are trying to destroy the \"light\" of the world as well to free Zeref. However, this alliance is merely a non-aggression pact, meaning that if one of the founding guilds was destroyed (eg. Oracion Seis), none of the guilds in the alliance would commit acts of vengeance.",
