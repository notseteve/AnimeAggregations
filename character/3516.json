  "description" : "Cornelius Alba is a magus, an acquaintance of http://anidb.net/ch1887 [Aozaki Touko] from their days as students. They were on good terms until the day Cornelius came to the realisation that Touko was a better magus than he was. Even though he was popularly considered a better magus than her, he eventually became so obsessed with his inferiority that he occasionally becomes deranged when speaking of her. He joined up with http://anidb.net/ch3515 [Araya Souren] not because of the latter`s goals, but solely in order to kill Touko to prove his superiority. Though would naturally be more powerful than both Araya and Touko, he is blinded by his arrogance and is not nearly as versatile as they are.",
