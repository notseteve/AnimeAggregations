A cool and level headed individual with a slight cleaning complex and a keen mind. While he looks polite from his appearance, he looks down on all of humanity. He obeys Shu Ujigawa`s every whim and looks after his daily needs, assisting in his \"playtime\" in its entirety and loathes Shu due to it. Contrary to his usual behavior he plays the drums rather powerfully.",
