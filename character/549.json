  "description" : "Spinarak is a six legged spider-like Pokémon with a marking on its back that is similar to a face. It spins a web of fine silk and then waits patiently and with complete motionlessness until prey, such as a bug Pokémon, becomes ensnared in the sticky web. It then waits until nightfall, at which point Spinarak prepares and then devours the prey. The web can be called Spinarak`s \"second nervous system\" because the Pokémon is able to determine the type of prey that has become trapped simply through the vibrations that are created.\nIn the anime, there is a small town whose police force uses Spinarak to fight crime, honoring a Spinarak that had caught a criminal called the black arachnid in the past. This was shown in the episode Spinarak attack.",
