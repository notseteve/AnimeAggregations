  "description" : "Heir to a long line of Shinto priests and exorcists, Nami is the most tranquil member of the AMP. She is also the tidiest, often shown cleaning up after http://anidb.net/ch13444 [Katsumi] and http://anidb.net/ch13443 [Kiddy].\nNami typically wears a kimono instead of the AMP uniform. She uses holy water and ofuda (paper charms with kanji written on them) with varying degrees of effect on http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawks]. She wields the Kirin Dagger and White Tiger Sword, two of the five sacred relics of the Yamigumo family. Nami also has the ability to detect Lucifer Hawks nearby.\nSource: wiki\nHer http://anidb.net/ch25788 [father] and http://anidb.net/ch25775 [grandfather] have both been involved in the events of the http://anidb.net/ch25784 [Project Gaia]; her sister http://anidb.net/ch25770 [Nana] failed to succeed her grandfather as the next head of the Yamigumo clan, thus the responsibility for setting things right has been imposed on Nami instead.",
