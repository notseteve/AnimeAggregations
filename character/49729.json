  "description" : "The VF-1 had long been replaced as a military vehicle but a version of the Valkyrie designated the VT-1C was designed for civilian use. The weapons were removed and the engines were replaced with more cost-effective units. A new head unit was designed and a set of FAST Packs were added for extended range along with the capability to launch from the surface of a planet and into orbit. Some VT-1C Commercial Valkyries featured after market modifications such as the harpoon launcher common to many VT-1C Valkyries operating on the planet Zola. The accessibility of these variable vehicles and their ability to be modified easily made them attractive targets for thieves and pirates who operated the VT-1C for space whale poaching.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/vt-1c.htm",
