  "description" : "Nero`s Seviper is a member of Plasma Gang who follows the commands of Nero. When N managed to rescue Braviary, Bianco`s Zangoose and Nero`s Seviper were summoned out to intimidate N. Plasma Gang realized that N had deceived them, so they intended to hurt him with Bianco`s Zangoose and Nero`s Seviper. Both the Pokémon seemed to hesitate a bit when N said he could free them as well from being abused by Plasma Gang but they were then forced to follow commands and attack N. N vowed that as long as Pokémon like Bianco`s Zangoose and Nero`s Seviper were being abused in the world by thugs, he`d continue fighting to free them. He wanted Bianco`s Zangoose and Nero`s Seviper live happily but at that time he wasn`t able to help them.\nNero`s Seviper and Bianco`s Zangoose were sent out to battle against Pikachu and Iris`s Excadrill. Iris`s Excadrill managed to knock out Nero`s Seviper while Pikachu almost finished off Bianco`s Zangoose but Braviary came to Pikachu`s rescue.",
