  "description" : "Silcoon is a cocoon Pokémon form that Wurmple can take. It can be considered a modern counterpart to earlier cocoon Pokémon species Metapod and Kakuna, but it is definitely the physical counterpart to Cascoon, an alternative cocoon form that Wurmple can take instead at random. Silcoon is a semi-mobile ellipsoid ball of white silk where the eyes of the mutating Pokémon inside are visible looking out. It hangs on tree branches awaiting evolution into its Beautifly form, during which it conserves energy by moving as little as possible, feeding on rainwater that is collected by its silk outgrowths, and generally keeping a constant watch over its surroundings for threats.\nIn the Pokémon anime, trainer May `s Wurmple evolves into the Silcoon stage and then the Beautifly stage shortly after, as opposed to Jessie`s Wurmple becoming a Cascoon and then a Dustox.",
