  "description" : "Babel was the second Silver Saint to meet his defeat at the hands of the Bronze Saints. He was a master of pyrokinesis and was able to travel in the form of a will-o`-the-wisp. He was sent along with Misty, Asterion and Mozes to kill the Bronze Saints for their crimes against Sanctuary. However, due to Aries Mu`s intervention, they went after the wrong Saints, ending up killing the Black Saints instead. Believing they had accomplished their mission, they retreated, though Misty stayed behind to confirm his suspicions. After some time, Babel grew worried and returned to find Misty dead on the beach. Cygnus Hyouga soon arrived and challenged the Silver Saint, who was confused because he thought he had already killed the Bronze Saint. Babel regained his composure and fought, confident he had the advantage with his flames, but was ultimately defeated by Hyouga`s freezing Cosmo.\nSource: Wikipedia",
