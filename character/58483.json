  "description" : "They take in humans to become demon (Yoma) killers, popularly named \"Claymore\" by the humans. To become a claymore meant becoming a half-human half-demon.\nIn the beginning was there both male and female warriors, but male claymores could not ignore their instinct to release their Yoki as doing so gave them something similar to sexual pleasure. This meant they quickly became an Awakened one. Thus only female claymores are made now.\nWhen a claymore is fully trained she is sent out on a long term mission to kill demons (Yomas) and are usually guided to them by a male member, whom also collects the reward/fee for killing the demons (Yomas) from the towns. This male member provides ever material things a claymore requires during the mission - like clothes and money.\nWhen a claymore releases her/his Yuki (demon/Yoma powers):\nAt 10% - Eyes change color to golden.\nAt 30% - Their face distorts.\nAt 50% - Their body distorts.\nAt 80% - They the transformation to Yoma begins, and most of the time it can not be stopped. When the transformation completes they be an Awakened one - an enemy, and will regular Yoma desire human guts.\nTo the public, calling a Yoma a \"Voracious Eater\" type means it have lived too long, but in fact it means \"Awakened Being\" (Claymore turned Yoma). An Awakened being is usually very strong so only the most powerful Claymores are used to kill them, which sometimes means a Claymore may end up killing a former friend.",
