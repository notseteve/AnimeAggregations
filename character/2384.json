She has tailored herself for a tall, prominent, important \"dream guy\". Phantom Dark seems to be all that she has dreamed of in a man.\nShe and Riku are twins, Risa being the younger of the two. Her appearance is sweet, feminine and she has an air of romanticism. She is the more \"girlie\" of the two sisters. She relies on tarot cards for predictions of what her and her sister`s future brings.",
