His gate absorbs infinite knowledge and foresees the future as well as happiness.\nHis real name is Yuji Mitsuoka. He is rich, good looking, and intelligent. But with his ability, he saw what will happen to his father`s business if he agrees to risk their trust funds for a business. Yuji`s dad didn`t believe him and he slaps him for telling `nonsense`. What Yuji predicted became true, and they lost everything. Yuji`s dad died, maybe when they lost all their assets. Yuji is left alone wandering in the streets with only little amount of money that can only afford a single bread.\nHe visited what`s left of his house, and he saw his uncle. Yuji knows that his uncle tricked his father and planned to take away all their belongings. Yuji knows everything, and for his uncle he is ominous. His uncle kicks him like he`s nobody. Yuji felt the pain until he gets numb. He crushed bugs crawling in his way. He enrages and opens a yellow gate. He calls his uncle a speck of a bug, his gate turns black and he destroys his house.\nYuji Mitsuoka changed his name to Reiji Kageyama, a non existent shadow of his past. Invader staffs Kikai Shogun and Akuma Hakushaku discovers him and made alliance with him. They controlled him, but this Reiji in the end controls them.",
