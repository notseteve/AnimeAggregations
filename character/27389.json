  "description" : "Scraggy, known as the Shedding Pokémon. Once it locks eyes with an opponent, it launches a Headbutt attack without warning. It often pulls its pelt up to its neck, because the pelt protects it with its rubber-like elasticity. It will suddenly headbutt opponents that meet its gaze with a very thick cranium.\nIn the anime, Ash obtains a Pokémon egg which hatches into a Scraggy.",
