  "description" : "While Ash and Goh were eating scones, Skwovet appeared on the table and began eating Ash Ketchum`s scone. Goh looked up the Pokémon in the dex and then proceeded to get it.\nIt participated in the Vermilion City Pokémon Grand Eating Contest where Emperor Blaziken was consider the odds-on favorite to win but thanks to a few good strategies by Goh, such as getting Skwovet to pour Tamato Berry juice on its tart so its sweetness disappeared as eating it repeatedly would make it sick, allowed it to win the contest.\nGoh`s Greedent is the evolved form of Goh`s Skwovet. It evolved during the final round of the Vermilion City Pokémon Grand Eating Contest.",
