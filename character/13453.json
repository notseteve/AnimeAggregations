He loves to make fun of Keitarou, calling him a failure in girls and academics, but pulls back later on when Keitarou becomes more successful. He almost always appears with Haitani. His main interests are in women, and one of his only upside is some degree of skill in computers. He also seems to have an interest in older woman like Haruka. He is short, and is almost always shown with big round glasses.",
