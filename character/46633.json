  "description" : "The 82 Shiki Senjutsu Hokou Sentouki Zuikaku is a first generation TSF used by Imperial Japan Royal Guard dedicated to protection of the Shogun and related individuals.\nIt is a modification of the Type-77/F-4J Gekishin, which was licensed for Japanese production, and designed with a focus on improving mobility and decreasing weight. Like most Royal Guard TSFs, it has increased performance at the cost of maintainability and ease of production.\nIn 1978, orders were made to Fugaku, Kawazaki, and Mitsuhishi Heavy Industries for a Royal Guard-use TSF. However, since production of the Gekishin had only just started, they were unable to develop an all-new design at that time. Instead an upgraded machine based on the F-4J was proposed, and the offer was reluctantly accepted by the Royal Guards on the absolute condition that its performance was superior to its base design. Development began in 1979 using data from the European theater of combat.\nChanges from the F-4J include a redesign and reduction of the Zuikaku`s armor volume, resulting in a 20% weight decrease. It also includes an increased number of Japanese-made components, including a unique improved laser warning system. The prototype was completed in 1981, and after going through the necessary performance tests and trials, the Zuikaku entered service in 1982.\nAlthough these machines are succeeded by the Type-00 Takemikazuchi, they remain in use by the 1st, 2nd and 24th Royal Guard regiments due to the Takemikazuchi`s maintanence-intensive requirements.\nSource: Muv Luv Wiki",
