He is responsible for making sure that the plant The Kalos Power Plant directly generates solar power from space that is transmitted to earth via micro-waves and stored in the dam of a superconducting ring before being sent to Miare City.\nHe and his coworkers were tricked by Rocket Gang into letting them into the plant and were subsequently tied up while Rocket Gang began modifying the plants antennae. He was rescued by Ash Ketchum and his friends and was able to make the electricity flow backward which caused an overload that stopped the radio waves that were affecting the Electric type Pok√©mon in the area.\nAfter helping stop Rocket Gang, he flew off to Miare City in a helecopter to report on the incident. Clemont came along with him.",
