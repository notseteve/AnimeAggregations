  "description" : "A large vessel some four thousand meters long, the Meltlan Flagship is a heavily armed fleet command warship for the female Meltlan forces. As large as the Zentradi http://anidb.net/ch49050 [Nupetiet-Vergnitzs] battleship but less massive, the Meltlan Flagship is a medium scale vessel that commands smaller fleet branches within any Meltlan main fleet. Like its Zentradi counterpart, the Meltlan Flagship is armed with many weapons, numerous mecha, and is the largest conventional warship in the Meltlan forces, eclipsed only by the Lap Lamiz Mobile Fortress.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/Meltran-flagship.htm",
