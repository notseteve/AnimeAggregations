  "description" : "The oldest Messenger, its existence said to pre-date the Zoumotsu Animal toyline. The novel version of it does not have its guts hanging out of its body like the Zoumotsu Animals after it, but the anime version does. It has the same shape as a character which Kaede imagined before, with a voice similar to that of a voice actor who performs voice-overs for foreign movie stars. Kaede got it by mere chance though it is very scarce.",
