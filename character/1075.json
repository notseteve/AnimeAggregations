  "description" : "Walrein is among the few fully-evolved Pokemon that live in functional communities, down in glacial environments, made of members of its pre-evolved forms Spheal and Sealeo as well as itself. The Walrein are the dominant members of their society, protecting their groups from attackers with their large strong tusks. These tusks are strong enough to thoroughly shatter blocks of ice weighing ten tons. When alone in the Arctic seas, Walrein`s thick blubber insulates it from the extreme cold of sub-zero temperature water, and it uses its tusks to clear its way as it swims through ice floes. The blubber is also resilient enough to make enemy attacks such as bites bounce off relatively harmlessly.",
