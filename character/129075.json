However, he had a change of heart and is now working as a nursery school teacher. Extremely strong and manly, but a very caring person inside. Daimon Kusunoki has been his childhood friend since elementary school. He`s very happy to dress and look like this for Fantôme Iris.\nHis HARU persona is a vampire from a differing faction. However, he has come to understand the ideals of FELIX and now works together with him.",
