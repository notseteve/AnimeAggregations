  "description" : "Sasami is a girl at Riki`s school and is Rin`s rival; surprisingly, while Rin loves cats, Sasami is a devoted dog lover. Due to this, she will often get in a fight with Rin, though since she is the soon-to-be captain of the girl`s softball team, she sends in three new team members first before she goes in herself; the three girls` names are: Yukari Nakamura, Rei Kawagoe, and Sakiko Watanabe. Her name is thought to be a tongue twister, which even she manages to mix up. She has a romantic interest in Kengo Miyazawa, but Kengo has no interest in returning her favor.\nSource: Wikipedia",
