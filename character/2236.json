Known as \"Rasa\" among the conservative factions, when Marina decided to accept the role of princess, he volunteered to become her opposition in order to contain the conservatives from getting radical and violent. His sudden abduction by Ali`s forces had touched off a coup d`Ã©tat with radical elements of the Azadistani army leading it against Marina and the rest of her reformist-leading government.\nHe was later tracked down and rescued by Setsuna, Lockon and Hong Long, and returned to make a joint statement with Marina, which temporary quelled the rebellion. It is revealed by Marina in the fourth episode of the second season that he died by unknown means during the gap between season one and two.",
