  "description" : "The Imperial Minister of Defense, he directly commands the 27th galactic frontier division. http://anidb.net/ch7044 [Dom]`s direct superior, he has shepherded the young captain through the Imperial Forces and acts as a father figure for him.\nWhile strongly suspicious of http://anidb.net/ch7050 [Wang]`s motives for starting the war with the United Planets, he lacks the political strenght to directly oppose him. Fiercely loyal to the empress, he does all he can to protect her from the machinations of her ambitious prime minister. However, this patriotism will not let him directly question the war in public, putting him in a very tenuous position within the Imperial Court.",
