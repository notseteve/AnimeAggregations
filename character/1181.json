  "description" : "Burmy is a Bagworm Pok√©mon that can take on three forms by making cloaks out of different materials depending on where it battles. In grassy areas, it creates a cloak of twigs and leaves that also protects it from cold winds. In caves, it makes a cloak out of sand and dirt. In buildings, it uses trash and other materials to make its cloak. If the cloak is broken in battle, it makes a new one quickly. Upon evolution, if female, a Burmy will evolve into Wormadam, which also takes on a form similar to the cloak the Burmy was wearing, while male Burmy evolve into Mothim.",
