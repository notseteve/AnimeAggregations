  "description" : "Karura was once princess of Nan-Tunku before the Shakukoporu deposed her and placed a puppet leader at the head of the state. She joins Hakuoro after she is found having slaughtered many soldiers from another country who were holding her prisoner. Despite showing concern for her country (which she conceals), she has forsaken her past as royalty and decided to live her life as Karura, a simple woman, and as a sign of this vow continues to wear a large metal collar around her neck placed there in her captivity. She is one of the last two Giriyaginas on Earth, along with Derihourai, her younger brother.\nShe also appears in Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen, as the owner of an inn in the capital city, and it is revealed that she, along with most of Hakuorou`s women, had a hand in raising Kuon, although she takes exception to Kuon calling her `mother`, preferring that she call her `elder sister`.",
