  "description" : "Emma is a well-intentioned Titan pilot who switches her allegiance to the AEUG. Initially one of three junior officers chosen to test the Titans` Gundam Mk.II prototypes, Emma defects to the rebels after realizing the brutality of her leaders. Her military discipline and high-quality training make her an invaluable addition to the AEUG`s pilot roster, and when Kamille Bidan receives the Zeta Gundam, Emma inherits his Gundam Mk.II. Even as a rebel soldier, Emma retains her strict professional demeanour, which sometimes causes friction with her more casual comrades.",
