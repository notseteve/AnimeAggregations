  "description" : "One of the girls in the Manga Society at the time Ogiue attempted to join, she seems to harbor strong feelings of resentment towards Ogiue. Criticizing Ogiue for slipping into her Tohoku dialect when she doesn`t speak formally, Yabusaki herself speaks in a highly pronounced Kansai dialect, which she says scares those from Kantou. When Ogiue is rejected as a vendor for the next ComiFes, Yabusaki (grudgingly) invites her to become a guest artist in her own circle`s doujinshi. Though she appears only towards the end of the manga, she shows up much earlier in the anime, in episode 3 of season 2.",
