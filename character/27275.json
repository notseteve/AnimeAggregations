  "description" : "Audino, is known as the Hearing Pokémon. With its big ears, it can access other Pokémon`s emotions and health. It also has the power to understand its surroundings through slight sounds. Audino replaces Chansey and Blissey as the preferred companions of Pokémon Center nurses in the Unova Region, despite its gender ratio being equally balanced.\nPlayers often search incessantly for it, as it gives an enormous amount of Experience Points when defeated, making the training of a Pokémon slightly easy. It also is a Pacifist, based on its healer ability. It can, despite being a pure-normal type, learn nine Psychic-type moves, with two more from breeding.",
