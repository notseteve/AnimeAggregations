  "description" : "Solf J. Kimblee, the \"Red Lotus Alchemist\" (sometimes referred to as the \"Crimson Alchemist\") is a former State Alchemist and special agent working under the direct orders of http://anidb.net/ch10175 [Führer King Bradley]. Admittedly sadistic and arguably psychopathic, Kimblee was imprisoned in Central City for several years after his official involvement in the Ishval Civil War for having infamously turned his unique brand of combustion-based combat alchemy on people who were not on his government-approved kill list. Due to conspiratorial acts at the top of government, Kimblee is officially exonerated of his crimes so as to serve as the Führer`s hidden left hand in the secret battles to come.\nAs a result of the schism between the storylines of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and the 2003 anime series, Solf J. Kimblee appears prominently in both but is a rather different character in each.",
