  "description" : "An American munitions expert, frequently hired by the British Library for mercenary work. Anderson has no superpowers, but is good with fairly well trained and good with weapons. A weapon off sorts he wields is his knowledge of papermasters, being more knowledgeable than most when pitted against them. He is a sarcastic realist who tries to keep situations calm and professional, although sometimes he is overwhelmed by the eccentric, super-human people around him.",
