  "description" : "Rito`s mother is a fashion designer and a scout for fashion models. Normally working overseas, she returns home to check up on the family. Despite initially appearing to be refined and chic, Ringo`s personality is equally as odd as Saibai`s, where she has a tendency to start sizing women up with her hands, whenever she spots pretty girls. Ringo seems to take her work very seriously, having immediately entered \"work-mode\", when she meets Lala and Haruna for the first time. Like her daughter, Ringo is also highly perceptive, able to read Haruna`s feelings towards Rito. With the help of Lala, she returns for the Christmas party and mistakes Celine as her son`s child.",
