  "description" : "Elesa`s Emolga was the second Pok√©mon that Elesa used in her gym battle against Ash. It was first matched up against Ash`s Palpitoad who had just defeated her Elesa`s Zebstrika and was quite weak from the battle. Elesa`s Emolga used Attract to make Ash`s Palpitoad infatuated with it and then quickly finished it off. It then faced Ash`s Snivy and its combination of Acrobatics and Aerial Ace was just too hard for Ash`s Snivy to defend against as the type advantage also hampered it. Elesa`s Emolga knocked out Ash`s Snivy and was then matched up with Pikachu and was knocked out with one attack, Pikachu Iron Tail.",
