  "description" : "Piloswine has elements of wild boars and mammoths, but is most similar to muskox. Piloswine thrives in cold climates. It has adapted to such inhospitable environments; its thick, shaggy fur which covers its body almost completely shields it against the low temperature, while its rugged hooves provide traction on slippery and frictionless ice surfaces. Piloswine has difficulty seeing because the fur covers its eyes, but it compensates for that by being extremely sensitive to sound. If an ill-meaning individual makes an incriminating noise, Piloswine will home in on the threat and charge at it repeatedly, since it can`t see clear enough to tell when the danger has been neutralized.",
