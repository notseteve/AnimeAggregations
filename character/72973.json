However, as most things turn out, that didn`t always go according to plan.\nLater, she gets third party addons installed by Koro-sensei, complete with a full-size LCD screen. However, her owners (or \"parents\" so to speak) think that her new abilities would be hindered by Koro-sensei`s upgrades.\nIn episode 9 it is revealed that while she was reformatted and reinstalled with the AI that her owners programmed her with along with the \"unauthorised mods\"; she actually boots into the Koro-sensei installed AI the next morning.",
