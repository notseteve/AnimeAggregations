  "description" : "Flora participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament. She faced Cilan in the first round. In her battle with Cilan she seemed to be a bit stern but a formidable opponent. Initially she did well in the battle but Cilan had been studying her initial moves and he went into his Tasting Time and explained that Flora`s Gothorita is an honors student with perfect marks in speed and technique. He realized her weakness as a Trainer and how to counter Flora`s Gothorita. Cilan defeated Flora and eliminated her from the tournament while noting that it was a relatively easy battle for the first round.",
