Nearly nothing is known about him except that he is a \"Double Hunter\" (two stars) and has the qualifications, according to Kite, to become a Triple Hunter (three stars). He is extremely rich and as powerful as the president of a country. All other information about him is classified even in the official Hunters database. Netero said to Bisuke that Ging is one of the five best Nen users in the world. He is also the main creator of the Greed Island game. He claims that he does not want to see Gon because he is too ashamed of himself for being absent in Gon`s life; however he was willing to allow Gon to meet with him after beating Greed Island if he was alone.",
