  "description" : "Hisui is one of two, as well as Shiki`s personal maid of the Tohno house, the other being her twin sister, Kohaku. She is usually very reserved and gives off a rather cold feeling. Despite this, however, she is in fact quite caring, and is always thinking about those who are close to her. She is very skilled in cleaning and arranging, but is rather inept at cooking because her sense of taste is very \"flexible\".",
