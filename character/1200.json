  "description" : "At the beginning of the series, Shimazu Yoshino is shown as frail girl who was constantly being cared for by her grande sœur, http://anidb.net/ch1201 [Hasekura Rei]. She was voted for the best petite sœur as everyone considered her to be soft and sweet. However, Yoshino is very independent and in some ways tomboyish, despite her sickly status and feminine appearance.\nAfter her heart surgery, she became more energetic throughout the series and http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi] began to see more of her fits of temper, which were usually directed towards Rei. In addition to being Rei`s petite sœur, Yoshino is also her cousin and next-door neighbor. She admires and loves Rei, but becomes upset with her every time she acts overprotective and fragile.\nSource: Wikipedia",
