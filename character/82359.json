In reality, they were a private army owing allegiance to http://anidb.net/ch743 [Truniht] and his cronies such as http://anidb.net/ch762 [Togliatti], acting to intimidate, assault and even murder their political opponents.\nIt is revealed later that there are deep connections between the Terraists and the PKC.",
