  "description" : "The Dorssian Army`s main-force, mass-produced units, equipped with large Eisen Geist shields and retractable Duquennoy Cannon beam weapon. Two types exist: the manned version, which brings to mind a burly, two-eyed beast; and a plane-type, unmanned version. They are usually employed in three-unit squads composed of one manned and two unmanned units. Their forearms are modular weapons units that can be swapped out to provide beam weaponry, projectile weaponry, close-quarters weaponry, etc.\nSource: aniplexusa.com",
