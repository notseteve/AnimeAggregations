  "description" : "Karin Maaka`s younger sister, Maaka Anju is a normal vampire who, for much of the series, has yet to reach the onset of her adulthood, and thus is not required to suck the blood of others. Due to her young age, Anju can travel outside when it is cloudy, during dusk, or when she is carrying her parasol to block out the sun. Despite her young age, Anju is quite proficient in the vampire art, and has a group of bat familiar spirits who are able to aid in her watch over Karin. Anju has a collection of many dolls in her room, but her favorite seems to be Boogie, which she carries around almost everywhere she goes.\nAs Karin is unable to erase human memory, Anju`s aid is frequently required after Karin has bitten a human. However, Anju knows that when she matures, Karin will be alone when she is outside during the day, so she persuades Karin`s parents to allow Kenta to know about Karin without having his memories erased so that he can look after her in Anju`s stead. Anju may seem very emotionless at times, but she also seems to possess quite a temper; she can be very scary if anyone hurts or teases Karin. She is also hurt when Karin attempts to be cheerful over Anju`s moving from the light to darkness as she matures.",
