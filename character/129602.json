  "description" : "Yoko is a celebrity stylist and is known as a Charisma Trimmer (カリスマトリマー) in the Japanese version. When it comes to shaping the fur of Pokémon, no one does it better than her. She was working in a shop Hau`oli City when Kartana trimmed a group of Furfrou she was going to work on and made them look like an Alolan Vulpix, Ninetales, and Arceus.\nYoko is likely based off of Ryuuji Akiyama`s alternate persona, Yoko Fuchigami as the resemblance is nearly identical. It`s also possible that the character is based off of JUNKO KOSHINO.",
