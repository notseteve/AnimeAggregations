  "description" : "Graffel, the 7th Pillar, also works under Naga and is first presented when he interrupts Toujou and Izuma`s fight, having been attracted to it by Izuma`s demonic energy. He is very proud of his power and considers humans and lower demons inferior, and nearly kills Toujou and Izuma before sensing Saotome`s attack on Hecatos and rushing to his aid. He is sent back to the demon world by Saotome. He is later the first victim of Oga and Beel`s Super Milk Time.\nGraffel is general Yata`s younger brother, although Yata considers him a good-for-nothing. Despite this assessment, his loyalty to Lord En is such that, alongside Hecadoth and Naga, he takes the initiative to kill Oga without authorisation from the Squad`s leadership, and is ready to give his life to attain that goal. After their second defeat, he and Hecadoth are seen imprisoned in Akumano High`s dungeon.\nSource: wiki",
