  "description" : "Mari is a devout Catholic who dreams of becoming the next Mother Teresa. She`s starting at a new school called Perfect Religion Academy, a boarding school of religious tolerance where kids of all faiths study their theologies together. She is quickly befriended by her roommate, a tomboy named Saori (a Hindu), and starts to acclimate to life on campus. Mari is a shy girl, clumsy and weak-willed, and the two quickly establish a pattern where Saori looks out for her.\nMari soon discovers the dark secret of PR Academy, the evil cult known as Dark Buddha, which kidnaps students and converts them against their will. When they kidnap Saori, Mari feels helpless, and begins praying to God for help. But instead, Buddha appears before her, and gives her a magical fundoshi (sumo wrestling loin cloth). A magical girl transformation sequence later, Mari is Gautaman, a scantly clad superhero that attacks the bad guys with her exposed butt-cheeks. She jumps in and saves the day, sending the forces of Dark Buddha running. A few minutes later, she`s back to normal, and completely horrified at the fact that she was presenting herself like a Mandrill, and Dark Buddha is regrouping to find out who this mysterious Gautaman REALLY is.",
