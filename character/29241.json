  "description" : "A newly introduced Specter, Earthly Beast Star, Cait Sith no Cheshire is somewhat of a comic relief character, acting more like a servant than a combatant, as he`s seen riding Pandora`s carriage and guiding the Specter that invaded Jamir. His mannerisms are depicted in the stereotypical feline behavior common in manga and anime. Currently, he scorts Pandora in her quest to punish Alone, and still hasn`t exhibited any abilities or intention to fight yet. Reminiscing about their encounter in Jamir, Cheshire prepares to engage Tenma in battle, which never comes to pass as the groups separate. After Rhadamanthys` death, Cheshire is taken by Athena, and witness the petrified Saints and soldiers come back to life by the goddess` intervention.",
