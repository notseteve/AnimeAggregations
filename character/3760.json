  "description" : "The former lieutenant of the 8th Division under Captain Kyouraku Shunsui. She is a girl with glasses and long, braided, dark hair, who dresses in a sailor fuku, as opposed to the more Western-style uniforms worn by the female students of Karakura High School. She seems easily irritated and apparently likes to read erotic manga. She is also very curious, and would spy on the captain`s meetings during her time in Soul Society.",
