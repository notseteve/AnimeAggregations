  "description" : "This four-legged mobile suit is the main weapon of ZAFT`s ground forces. Its quadrupedal design makes the BuCUE very stable even in difficult terrain like deserts and snowfields, and its legs are equipped with caterpillar tracks for high-speed movement in these environments. The turret hardpoint on its back can carry either powerful railguns or a large missile pod, and after the Earth Alliance`s prototype Gundams fall into ZAFT`s hands, many BuCUE units are fitted with head-mounted beam sabers based on the technology of these captured Gundams.",
