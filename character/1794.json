  "description" : "Claire was raised with the Gandor brothers, and as such, is a part of the family. Claire is now an assassin named Vino—Spanish for \"wine\"—earning the name because of his predilection for mutilating the bodies of his victims beyond recognition, which usually leaves him covered in a thick layer of blood. A former trapeze artist, he now works undercover as a conductor on the Flying Pussyfoot, and later happily takes on the persona of the vengeful \"Rail Tracer\" monster. Claire is a thorough-going solipsist who believes that the world is a show put on for him, and that he has complete control over it. He proposes to Chane at their first meeting, and searches for her in Manhattan in 1932. He finds her after clearing his contract with the Gandor family, assassinating members of the Runorata family for them.",
