  "description" : "This fortress-type Gunmen is Guame`s flagship. Its carapace is extraordinarily resilient, as evidenced by its survival of the aerial carrier gunman Dai-Ganten`s impact. It is propelled by many legs on its underside, and can travel at a decent clip. It later combines its strengths with Teppelin to form a whirling tornado of energy that destroys anything that comes in contact and disrupts communications and navigation.\nThe Gurren-Lagann destroyed the Dai-Gundo from beneath the surface of the earth, piercing its armour and reversing its spinning, violating its union with Teppelin and dissipating its energy storm before lancing it clean through, causing it to explode. The Dai-Gundo`s means of locomotion was later adopted by the humans for the various vehicles they use (cars literally ran on legs, not wheels).",
