  "description" : "Squirtle known as the Tiny Tortoise Pokémon, are selectable as one of three \"Starter Pokémon\" at the beginning of the games of the main series of Pokémon RPGs that are set primarily in the Kanto region (Pokémon Red and Blue for Game Boy, as well as their remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen for Game Boy Advance). Squirtle are not acquirable anywhere else in the main series aside from Pokémon Yellow. The name \"Squirtle\" is a portmanteau of the words \"squirt\" and \"turtle\". When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw their limbs into their shells and spray water from their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or merely to intimidate it.",
