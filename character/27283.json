  "description" : "Herdier, known as the Loyal Dog Pokémon, is a dog-like Pokémon with particular similarities to a Yorkshire Terrier. Its face sports an abundance of cream fur, forming a \"mustache\" and a three-pointed crest of fur on its head. Its ears are large and perked, and it has a shaggy dark blue pelt on its body and tail. Its limbs are orange-brown. The black fur that covers its body like a cape is heavy, and softens the impact of attacks. Faithful to its trainer`s instructions, it has helped trainers raise Pokémon since long ago.\nThe Escapist commented that while much of the Pokémon in Pokémon Black and White look weird, \"I will readily admit to wanting to hug that Yorkshire Terrier one, though. It`s just too cute!\"",
