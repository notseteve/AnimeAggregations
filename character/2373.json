  "description" : "The King of Deviluke and Emperor of the known universe, Gido is the father of Lala, Nana, and Momo. Despite his near omnipotent power, he has the physical appearance of a child, looking slightly devilish, with shark-like teeth, spiky black hair, and the characteristic Devilukean tail; while his daughters` tails end in spades, his appears as a wicked looking trident. Gido`s personality borders juvenile delinquency and perversion, thus Lala claims the only reason he wants her to get married is so he can step down as king and be free to pursue his perverted hobbies. Lala states his current appearance is due to him using too much power during the \"Galaxy Unification Wars\", which desized his body, following his conquest.",
