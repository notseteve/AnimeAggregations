  "description" : "Shuuji`s first lover and Tetsu`s wife. She used to train the track team when she was younger and her students called her Fuyumi-senpai because of the close age difference. She had an intimate and inappropriate relationship with Shuuji when they were younger - the manga shows her giving him detailed instructions for pleasuring her - and keeps bringing this up when she seduces him. She hates feeling lonely since her husband, Tetsu, is never home since he`s always away in the army so she decides to take comfort in Shuuji, who has a remarkable similarity with Tetsu.\nShuuji finally stops her advances after Tetsu dies, saying that the only person he wants to protect isn`t Fuyumi. She admits she has always used him to fill her own physical and emotional needs, slaps him, and rides her bike to her parents` house, never to be seen again. In the manga version, she is seen in her parents` house, helping her sick father and reminiscing about Tetsu the night before Chise destroys the city.",
