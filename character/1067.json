  "description" : "Chimecho is known as the \"Wind Chime Pok√©mon.\" Chimecho`s light frame and its psychic powers enable it to freely fly around, especially during the hot season. If a Chimecho wishes to remain in one place for a while, it employs its suction cup to affix itself on trees or the eaves of a building. Chimecho has the distinctive ability to produce a ringing cry, the volume of which is amplified inside its hollow head and comes out as a chiming sound. A Chimecho can produce seven different tones to communicate various messages to its kindred. If threatened, Chimecho can use its cries as a defensive weapon, turning them into ultrasonic waves that knock its foes back.\nAlthough Chimecho did not officially exist at that time, a figure of it appears in the TV episode \"The Ghost of Maiden`s Peak\" on one of the small lantern ships (18:30-18:35 in the US version).",
