  "description" : "The Scarlet Queen, Elizabeth Rose Bloodflame paves the way for the world and all of its people.\nNot only does she stand at the forefront during missions with her physical prowess, but she also captures the hearts of all around her with her beautiful singing voice.\nShe is highly self-disciplined and a bit too hard on herself, but, perhaps due to her culture`s emphasis on politeness and manners, she tends to go a bit soft on those around her.\nAs a result, she spends her days stressed out with her work coordinating Justice, but it seems like there`s nothing a nice nap in a comfy bed can`t fix.",
