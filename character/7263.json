  "description" : "A boozy bar hostess who is usually known to lounge around wearing skimpy lingerie while hanging around Ikkoku; Mrs. Ichinose occasionally complains when strangers are around, but generally the tenants have gotten used to her ways. She lives in Room 6 (Roku) and works a short distance away in a bar named Cha-Cha Maru, where the tenants gather to drink when not in Yuusaku`s room. She is known to let some of the bar`s male patrons buy her too many drinks, and often comes home from work drunk. Because she works the late-night shift at the Cha-Cha Maru, and because she spends the rest of the night drinking, she has a constant sleepy look on her face. She is generally aloof towards both Yuusaku and Kyouko, but she is not above joining Mr. Yotsuya in tormenting Yuusaku. She will often display a blatant sexual interest in Shun Mitaka when he is around, even though she is fully aware of his interest in Kyouko. Her family name (which means \"six trees\") is also the name of a Tokyo district infamous for expensive hostess bars Roppongi.",
