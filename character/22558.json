She has also been given the accolade of discovering the ancient city of Pokémopolis.\nShe has discovered many artifacts which have been linked to the ancient city. However her most important disovery was when she discovered an artifact after Ash`s Pikachu and Brock`s Vulpix blew a chunk of rock away from the mountianside when they diverted their attacks to avoid a Jigglypuff.\nAfter Jessie`s Arbok later disturbed and awakened another relic containing a giant Gengar which emerged and started to absorb Pokémon and People into itself.\nEve had to quickly solve the riddle of the artifacts to quickly return the giant rampaging Gengar but only succeeded in accidently releasing the Pokémon in the artifact that she found, a giant Alakazam.\nAlakazam and Gengar started fighting and due to their size and power they threatened to destroy the area. Their fighting was stopped when Jigglypuff`s song managed to awakened the final giant Pokémon, a giant Jigglypuff, who managed to put both the Giant Alakazam and Gengar to sleep.",
