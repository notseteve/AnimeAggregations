  "description" : "Nama is a suit of Living Armor, who bears many similarities to Naga. Although there is no explicit confirmation, it is strongly hinted in the series that Nama is in fact Naga`s soul trapped in a suit of Living Armor. Both Nama and Naga have the same laugh, and have similar mannerisms (although Nama`s manner of speaking is noticeably different from Naga`s, as Lina points out). Furthermore, Nama states that she was a treasure hunter who got her soul trapped in the armor as the result of touching an enchanted pot. A flashback depicting this shows Nama as a silhouette, which strongly resembles Naga. Nama also told Amelia that her mother died when she was young and was lonely as a result. Finally, Nama can perform the \"Pacifist Crash\" attack, a signature move of the Seyruun royal family.",
