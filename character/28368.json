  "description" : "The future Louis XVI, the Dauphin Louis Auguste of France, is grandson of Louis XV. He is very close to his tutor Anna Rochefort, seeing her as something between an elder sister and a mother. He is heir to the throne of France, although he seems reluctant to become king. He is loosely based on the historical Louis XVI (again the dates are wrong; the historical Louis XVI would have been a year old in the time period of the anime).",
