  "description" : "The largest and strongest player in the Deimon Devil Bats, Kurita Ryoukan is a kind-hearted individual, and the only thing bigger than his body is his heart. He becomes Sena`s second friend after entering Deimon High School. He is somewhat dim-witted, nearly giving away Sena`s identity as Eyeshield 21, but is immediately silenced by Hiruma (in the manga, he did it by electrocuting Kurita with a stun gun, whereas in the anime, he simply did so by tossing the much-larger teammate contradictory to Kurita`s overall weight). When playing, Kurita shouts his kiai \"Funnuraba!\" (Here I come!) when exerting extra effort.",
