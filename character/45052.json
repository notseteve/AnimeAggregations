  "description" : "Part of the Boening`s Phoenix Initiative, the F-15 ACTV Active Eagle is an upgrade plan for the aging F-15 frame, using avionics, internal parts and external component hardware upgrades to boost its overall performance and even provide (very) limited stealth.\nThe most radical changes to the Eagle frame is the addition of two thrusters to its back where its weapons would usually be stored; this reduces the Active Eagle`s carrying capacity and operation time, but gives it greater speed and acceleration of up to 8G. The thrusters can be removed to make way for the standard weapons rack system, but this reduces the Active Eagle`s performance. Reworked jump units based off technology from the F-22A Raptor and shoulder-mounted thrusters improve its maneuverability, and its forearms carry sensor pods that extend its detection and striking range.\nThe Active Eagle`s upgrades are intended to mould it into an offensive role capable of matching 3rd generation TSF standards, where superior range, speed and mobility allows the Active Eagle to quickly and efficiently annihilate any BETA that penetrate the defensive line.",
