  "description" : "Woo (full name, William Will Woo) is a member of the Original Seven and heir to a noble family. He appears cold and collected on the outside, but is filled with rage and turmoil on the inside. Woo suffered from the Oedipus complex, or he regarded his father as an adversary and competitor for the exclusive love of his mother. When Woo was an adolescent, he attacked his father with a knife in an attempt to kill him, but his mother jumped in the way and took the hit instead and was killed. After that, Woo left the township his family had governed due to the painful memories, and left it to succumb to decay. However he says he returned to this place to intercept Van, and that this proved he had finally succeeded. William had become increasingly mentally unstable since then and seeks to unleash his pent-up rage in any way he can. He also calls Van and Gadved `Old types`. Van kills him after luring him towards Dann on top of his castle and they clash in a fight of wills where it is revealed that William `abandoned his mother for his father`s sake` (This, along with silhouettes of his parents shown in flashbacks, suggest that his father was the Claw Man). Van then challenges this by saying that no one who abandons their true love can defeat him.\nIn Super Robot Wars K, it is confirmed that the Claw Man was indeed his father.\nArmor: Mets√§ of Tuesday resembles a fencing sword.",
