  "description" : "He is Ryouko`s partner, acting as her driver and bodyguard while she researches quantum phenomena. He doesn`t understand the bulk of Ryouko`s work, asking for simplistic explanations here and there, but he sticks around her anyway.\nHe does get to shine at the very end of the series, when timespaces are converging and a corrupt corporate leader refuses to let Ryouko stop it. He shoots Kouriyama, only to find that he`s unaffected because \"apparently there`s a me that doesn`t get shot!\" Kouriyama remains unhurt after the timespaces separate.",
