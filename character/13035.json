  "description" : "Sayoko has a very dark personality and is not very responsible. In the manga, she is initially suicidal, though this aspect of her character was cut out in the transition to the anime. (Also, none of her attempts at suicide are even remotely successful so they are normally just for gags.) Despite this change, however, she still remains irresponsible in both productions, but wants to make Asami happy and to live with her for a long time. Their room is filled with cardboard boxes, which they use as furniture and bedding, being extremely poor. Her father is a rich sculptor, with whom she became estranged in her youth over her choice of her husband; rather than let her parents choose a fianc√© for her, she eloped with the estate`s gardener. Her favourite food is Mizuyoukan. Despite her evident uselessness throughout the series, she really cares for Asami. Though her age isn`t revealed in the manga, her birthday is October 17.\nIt should also be noted that despite her poor skills in living, she possesses great skills in stuffs like chess (to which Momono depicts as a useless skill in life) and in arts (capable of making artpieces out of almost anything (sand, snow, wood,...even food)), possibly inheriting her father`s skills. At the end of the manga, she is seen to work as a freelance sculptor, making an expensive looking wooden dragon. It is also revealed that she isn`t really lazy or bad at working but rather, simply having low or no confidence and motivation.\nSource: Wikipedia",
