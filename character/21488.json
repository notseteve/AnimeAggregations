  "description" : "The complete opposite of Yuko. Eri is sensitive and hardly speaks what`s on her mind afraid to hurt the feelings of others. Unlike Yuko, Eri does show concern for the troubles in the strange planet and does her best to help them out. Her idiology is that if they are there, they can at least try to help them since they might be stuck there forever. Eri likes to write fantasy stories and throughout her journey she writes a story based on her own experiences in the world she`s in.",
