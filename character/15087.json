  "description" : "During the 7th Space War, the Space Revolutionary Army developed various mobile suits and armors for use by Newtype pilots. One such suit was the RMSN-008 Bertigo. This agile mobile suit carried the standard armament of beam rifles, machine cannons and beam sabers, but its most powerful weapon was the bit. These remotely operated beam guns could only be operated by a Newtype, but their power was devastating. The ability of the bits to create an all-range attack would prove too be nearly impossible for a non-Newtype to beat. Before the war`s end, the SRA planned to bring a swift end to the battle with its Operation Lilac. In this operation, five Bertigos were supposed to escort the massive Newtype mobile fortress MAN-003 Patulia down to Earth to attack the United Nations Earth headquarters. However, the five Bertigos were destroyed in atmospheric combat, and the Patulia changed course and crashed elsewhere. It is not known how many Bertigos survived the war, but at least one unit survived until A.W. 0015 and was piloted by artificial Newtype Carris Nautilus. The effectiveness of the Bertigo was displayed in battle when Carris severely damaged Garrod Ran`s GX-9900 Gundam X, which was later repaired and upgraded to the GX-9900-DV Gundam X Divider. After the fall of Fort Severn, Carris helped to rebuild the city and later joined resistance forces fighting against the New United Nations Earth in North America. After rescuing the former crew of the Freeden, Carris joined their fight in space during the brief 8th Space War.",
