  "description" : "She is the first main protagonist of the story. Basically, she had an unrequited love for Yuuji Kagura when they were young. She`s always dreamed that Yuuji would one day grow up to be a handsome, suave young man. When she finally meets him again ten years later she is disappointed to find that`s he has become obnoxiously lewd and perverted, but over time realizes that even with all these faults she still has the same feelings for him as she did when she was younger. Kazuki is a skilled member of her school`s swimming club. Her cooking skills leave much to be desired, however; although she can make her dishes look very good, she tends to add ingredients that end up turning innocuous food into culinary disasters capable of dropping the person eating it where they stand.",
