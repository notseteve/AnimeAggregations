  "description" : "A boy who is a friend of Cosmo`s and Kasha`s on Solo. He`s generally seen with Rapappa, a tame two-tailed squirrel perched on his shoulder. Although just a young kid, Deck desires to become a pilot of the Ideon and when Cosmo sees how dedicated he is to it, he allows Deck to become his co-pilot on the Ideo-Delta. As expected for his age, Deck is immature at times but for the most part gets along with everyone though gradually as the series progresses he begins to prove himself as a pilot, establishing himself as a predominant role in controlling the Ideon.\nSource: Wiki",
