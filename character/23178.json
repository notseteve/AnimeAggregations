  "description" : "A next-generation mass production mobile suit used by the Orb Defense Forces. While the previous M1 Astray was designed mainly for land warfare, the Murasame can change into a fighter form for aerial combat and interception, and it boasts high performance in space as well. This all-purpose machine is more than a match for the latest ZAFT and Earth Alliance mobile suits, and serves as a testimonial to Orb`s advanced military technology. The veteran pilot Andrew Waltfeld has his own Murasame painted in distinctive personal colors.",
