  "description" : "Cutiefly is a dual-type Bug/Fairy Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Ribombee starting at level 25.\nCutiefly is a tiny Pokémon with comparatively large wings. It has a pale yellow body with a white face and tail. It has large eyes with spots resembling pixels in them, a long brown nose, and two tiny transparent tufts on its head resembling antennae. The wings on its back are wide and flat. They are white with brown loop markings toward the bottom and have a white tuft of hair between them. It has four spindly legs with round feet.\nCutiefly is capable of detecting the aura of living things, such as plants, people, and Pokémon. It collects nectar and pollen from flowers, which are found by the color and brightness of their auras. However, when a living creature is excited, its aura resembles flower in full bloom. As a result, Cutiefly tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. This Pokémon can be found in fields and meadows, but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings.",
