  "description" : "Akutsu Akuru is a smart and serious high school student who is constantly annoyed by http://anidb.net/ch89068 [Yoshiko]`s antics. The reason he and Yoshiko are classmates is because he chose to attend a local high school as the really academic schools were too far away for him to study properly. He scolds Yoshiko for her idiotic behavior, even resorting to punches. He prefers to study, and does not have a girlfriend or any friends besides Yoshiko, although http://anidb.net/ch89070 [Sayaka] agrees to be his friend out of pity. A recurring gag is that he is never able to get a perfect score on any exam.\nSource: Wikipedia",
