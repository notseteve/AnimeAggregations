  "description" : "A vain, attention-seeking bandit who calls herself \"The Blue Comet\". She is honest, yet unyielding, proud, and selfish. Although she and her brothers donate their spoils to the Unregistered Citizens clustered in the city`s underground and outskirts, they often cause large amounts of public damage in the process. She is armed with a laser-based hand pistol, and she rides a large motorcycle with three spherical wheels in front, driving wheels behind, and a cannon hidden in the frame. She occasionally hums the song \"Return to love (Jazz version)\" to calm herself.It is later revealed that she is actually Roy`s daughter Rita Revant. Her hair and eye colour had changed due to exposure to nanomachines from the Blast Fall. Having been adopted by Larry and Andy`s father with no memory of who she was, she initially resisted the idea that she was Roy`s daughter until later. She was supposedly killed in the collapse of a clock tower, but later, she was shown to be alive and working for Ashley Lynx, in order to follow their common dream of equality among residents. She was given a red and black Proceed suit. It also includes a jet pack, which allows her to fly. Solty eventually wore the suit in the final episode when she went into space. Eventually, she overcame Ashley`s brainwashing to see the limitations and problems of her attitudes and dream. During the \"Five Years Later\" epilogue, she is referred to as \"Representative Rita Revant\" by a radio broadcast, indicating she attains a position of political power.\n-Wikipedia-",
