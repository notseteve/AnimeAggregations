  "description" : "Primeape is a larger and stronger evolution of Mankey. Vicious and frenzied, even making eye contact with it can anger it. If it is annoyed, it will never stop chasing the offender. Its frenzies are most dangerous when forcefully woken up, as it relentlessly chases the quarry while half-asleep. Primeape can be obtained when a Mankey has earned enough experience to level up to level 28. Primeape can also be found in some grassy areas in Kanto and Johto.",
