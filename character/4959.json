When her father is assassinated, her mother and the kirin of Hou are killed before her; Shoukei is spared because she had been unaware of her father`s actions. Her name is removed from the register of Immortals and she is stripped of her royal name; as a commoner, Shoukei can only use her given name, Sonshou. Revoked her of status as member of Hou`s royal family, Shoukei is forced to live anonymously as a peasant without any luxuries and is displeased with the drastic changes in her life.",
