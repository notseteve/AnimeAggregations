Due to the belief that http://anidb.net/ch8750 [Chagum] was possessed and that the possession was the reason for the Drought Sign being seen, he ordered http://anidb.net/ch8750 [Chagum] to be killed. The Emperor is the only one able to kill http://anidb.net/ch8750 [Chagum] due to fact that was how his ancestor ascended the throne (by killing a Water Spirit), and the belief that only the Emperor knows this method.",
