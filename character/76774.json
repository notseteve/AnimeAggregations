  "description" : "Clementine is a rogue warrior from Zuranon and a former member of the Black Scripture, the strongest scripture in the Slane Theocracy.\nBefore she went rogue, Clementine held the 7th seat in the Black Scripture. Betraying the Scripture, she stole the magical Crown of Wisdom from one of the six Shaman-Princesses of the Theocracy, forcing her to flee and join Zuranon.\nShe is thought to be one of the strongest in the Slane Theocracy since she was a member of the Black Scripture, which is the strongest Scripture in the Slane Theocracy. She is stronger than Hamsuke, Gazef, and Brain, although Gazef can overwhelm her if he were to use use all of his magic items. However, if she were to get the equipment she had when she was in the Black Scripture, even Gazef with full gear could not defeat her.\nSource: Overlord Wikia",
