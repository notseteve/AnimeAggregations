  "description" : "Shiroishi Banri is a first-year university student taking up business and the drummer for the band Argonavis.\nDespite his thorough pragmatism and his dislike for waste, he is a constant high energy mood maker for Argonavis. He’s quite stingy and money-focused, though it doesn’t extend to greed. Whenever there is an opportunity for the band, he is usually among the first to suggest going the extra mile.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream! Wiki",
