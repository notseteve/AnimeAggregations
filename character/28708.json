Her prodigious acting was recognized by Hikaru, and with his encouragement, she joined the drama club. Sayaka is labelled a prodigy actress by her teacher and continues to hold leading roles in school plays. At home, her interest in acting is ignored by her family and her parents are constantly away due to work.\nSayaka falls in love with Hikaru and accidentally confesses to him during a school play. The two begin dating and were originally going to attend the same high school together, but due to her father`s work, she had to move away to Kyuushuu during the summer. Sayaka never contacts Hikaru afterwards despite her promises. Unexpectedly, she moves back to Tokyo at the age of 17, now a famous actress by the name of Sayaka Naruse, and enrolls at Hikaru`s high school. However, she doesn`t remember anything from before two years ago, including Hikaru, due to the shock of her parents dying shortly after her move.",
