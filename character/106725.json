  "description" : "Matoba Wataru is a first-year university student taking up Literature. He is the bassist and lyricist for the band Argonavis, and is the younger brother of Kenta Satozuka.\nIn stark contrast to the hot-blooded, idealistic, and optimistic Yuto, he is more cautious, realistic and pessimistic, often finding the negatives to Yuto`s attempts to be positive. And yet, it`s because he wants the band to be a success. He has an inferiority complex towards his older brother Kenta, and wants to surpass him.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream! Wiki",
