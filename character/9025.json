  "description" : "Ken has A and B versions: the eccentric scientist from our world, and the parallel world`s commander of the Earth Defense Force. Ken is Mitsuki`s father in this world, but is childless in the other world; naturally, he`s quite confused when our world`s Mitsuki calls him \"Dad.\"\nBoth Kens share a love for instant ramen, a slightly off-color sense of humor, and an understanding that Kazuki is special. Despite appearing to goof off on the job (antagonizing Rara never gets old), Commander Sanada takes it quite seriously. When the U.N. turns against the EDF, his subordinates remain loyal to him, proving his worth as a leader.\nWhen Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Ken Sanada returns to being a scientist as well as being married to Akane Yamano. In the new world, Mitsuki Sanada is his daughter and Dee Sanada is his adopted daughter. His relation to Kazuki is cause for question. Kazuki calls him \"Uncle\" but it is debated among fans whether they are actually related in the new world.",
