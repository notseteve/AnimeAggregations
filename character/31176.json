  "description" : "Yao is the daughter of one of the richest people in Miami City and seems to ask for his money a lot. She is part of the Miami City Police and sometimes is unaware of what danger she`s in. She has a love for senseless violence, not to mention a desire to be the center of attention to whatever her whim is. To her, being on the police is just an excuse to shoot people and blow buildings up. She just doesn`t care about anyone else... except herself and her partner Lu.",
