  "description" : "The combat butler of the Azumamiya family. He appears to have white hair and an almost always smiling face. His eyes are always closed and he is very polite. He encourages his master to be a gentleman and to be manly enough to fight his own battles even if he were to lose.\nIn contrast with his gentle and polite exterior, Nonohara is very brutal, senselessly beating his master when he acts like a weakling. In combat, whenever Kotarou asks for his help, he does the opposite, either throwing the Azumamiya into the battle zone or beating the boy up.",
