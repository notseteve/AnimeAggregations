  "description" : "A bubbly girl with pink hair that kidnaps Oz at Lutwidge. She was a participant in the Tragedy of Sablier and killed many under orders. She served the Baskerville house and had feelings for Glen 100 years ago. Her real name is Charlotte, but Jack gave her the nickname Lottie after they met. Lottie can`t forgive Jack for killing his supposedly best friend and object of her affection and thus is targeting Oz to talk to Jack. Her main objective was to find their master Glen, and to find out what actually happened on the night of the Tragedy of Sablier. Although she was one of the participants, she acted upon orders, and knew nothing behind the scenes. Hence why they approached Jack for the answers.\nSource: Wikipedia",
