  "description" : "The Seven Stakes of Purgatory, also known as the Seven Sisters of Purgatory, are the weapons which are said to be controlled by Beatrice. There are seven of them, named after the corresponding demons of the seven sins, and each one can gain power from said sin. The Stakes of Purgatory are described as being inescapable. Only powerful mages can control the Stakes of Purgatory, but they cannot hurt any who have not committed the sins, or have strong magical resistance. The Stakes can take on a human form and their true form, a powerful stake.\nWhile in human form, they rely on their blades of light for offense, switching to stake form to dodge attacks and get in their opponent`s blind spot. As for their stake form, while smaller, they are many times faster and can kill by impalement. They can also bounce off walls and anything blocking their way, able to attack from any angle. However, in stake form, they are far from invincible, and can still be injured or even killed if shot by guns. In Turn of the golden witch, the Stakes of Purgatory first appeared in human form, taking the shape of young girls, each with a different personality, but all have red irises. They can be distinguished through hair styles and colors. They are used in order to accomplish Beatrice`s epitaph, but they are also Ange`s friends during her school years.",
