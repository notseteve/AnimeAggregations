  "description" : "Fernandia Malvezzi is a graduate of a military academy for witches in Romagna. With a small degree of skill in healing magic, Fernandia was assigned to the magic medical corps, but she actually had a strong desire for a combat role. She snuck herself into a ground attack witch unit, one of the understrength sections of the Aeronautica Romagniana (Romagnan Air Force).\nAfter studying tactics with a Karlslander dive-bomber squadron, Fernandia, together with her best friends Luciana and Martina from the academy, flew many missions, even recording a destroyed heavy land Neuroi to their name. In recognition of the team`s fame and overwhelmingly positive evaluations, all three were given the honor of being admitted into the Pantaloni Rossi (Red Pants).\nNot long after, Fernandia`s unit was equipped with MC.202 Strikers. Her experience with those enlightened her towards air combat, and ever since `44 she has been using the G-55.\nEven though Fernandia can be extremely self-assured, headstrong, and impulsive, she also displays an undeniable friendliness, and she is a natural leader with the power to get others to do things her way. Within the team, she takes the role of commander and also vanguard.",
