  "description" : "Susanna von Beenemünde was http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Imperial] Consort to Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch206 [Friedrich IV] for several years, before he dismissed her in favour of http://anidb.net/ch205 [Annerose von Grünewald]. Unable to accept losing the emperor`s favour, Beenemünde hatched several plots to win back Friedrich`s favour. Mostly, these involved assassination attempts on Annerose`s younger brother, http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm]. These ill-conceived attempts all failed, yet there was never sufficient proof to indict the Baroness.\nAs her last, desperate act, Lady Beenemünde decided to murder Annerose von Grünewald herself. Beenemünde`s grief at having been stricken from Friedrich`s sight was so great that she believed he would return to her, if only Annerose were dead. The plan failed, and at the order of the Kaiser, Beenemünde was forced to drink poison, thus committing suicide. It was announced to the public that she died of natural causes, and Kaiser Friedrich IV personally attended her funeral.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
