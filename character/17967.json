  "description" : "Enters the show by beating Fuu in an eating contest and this winning Jin`s swords, which he begrudgingly used to pay for it because they were short on money. He agrees to give them back if they give him a tour of Edo. He tries to pass as Japanese although he is very clearly not. He is very excited by the kabuki play, and wants to meet the lead actor. He reveals that he is actually the Ambassador of Holland to Japan, which he hopes which he thought would have better accepted his homosexuality, which is why he attempted to blend in there and hide. He tells Fuu that her keychain is very dangerous to have around, and that she would find more about it in Nagasaki.",
