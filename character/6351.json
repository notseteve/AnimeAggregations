  "description" : "Her entire skeletal structure, as well as all of her muscles and skin, are composed of a special biological tissue, making it possible for her to make a complete transformation into any person: a transformation that goes beyond a simple disguise. It would not be expected from her cute baby-face, but she is a cool agent who never shows any sentiment or emotion during a mission. She has a motif based on G(reat) B(ritain) (007) from Cyborg 009. Her name is a reference to Sean Connery, who portrayed 007, much like Great Britain.",
