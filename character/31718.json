  "description" : "Older daughter of the Tsuwabuki family, who are skilled \"Chijutsushi\" (地術師, Earth Technique Practitioner). During her father`s absence due to \"illness\", she becomes the head of the Tsuwabuki family. Zenon, the behemoth of Mt. Fuji, stripped her powers as a Chijutsushi. Like Kazuma, she was ostracized for her lack of power by her family. She is later killed by Zenon in a fit of rage. It is notable that once Zenon`s restriction was lifted from her, Kureha`s power was of an extremely high level as seen in her fight with Zenon.",
