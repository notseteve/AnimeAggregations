  "description" : "Todoroki Yachiyo is a waitress at Wagnaria. She has a strange obsession with Kyouko that began when they were children, and will do anything she asks, which usually means making her a parfait or some other food. She will not tolerate anyone who even seems to make advances that may take Kyouko away from her, and will readily threaten someone inopportune enough to do so with her katana, which she carries at all times.\nSatou Jun seems to like her, and she seems to like him best among all of her male co-workers, but her obsession with Kyouko makes any progress between them unlikely.",
