  "description" : "An honours student at Jun`s school. She is quiet, and kind-hearted, although her speech and style tend to be very dry, and she often hides her true feelings. Tomoe was originally Hinaichigo`s medium, but the bond between them was broken when Hinaichigo relied too much on Tomoe`s energy and was defeated by Shinku. Currently, Tomoe helps Jun in his dealings with the Rozen Maidens and also assists him with his make-up work for school.",
