  "description" : "Dai Youko is, in the words of inukami http://anidb.net/ch10266 [Hake], \"A great monster that manipulates the dark side, petrifies his opponents, specializes in fire based spells\" - namely the Jaen and Dai Jaen techniques also used by http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko], only much more powerful - \"shakes the universe with a single leap and can do anything with his breath. He is strong and arrogant. When he feels irritated, he will destroy a whole mountain.\" Dai Youko is an elder kitsune who was sealed under a large stone by the founding patriarch of the Kawahira family and is also the father of Youko, who he usually addresses as `my dear daughter` or `cute Youko`. While all the things Hake said about him are true and do not even mention his ability to turn back time within a certain area, Dai Youko is also a doting father. He is apparently incapable of being angry with his daughter, although she twice aided in sealing him to prevent him from doing damage. A bit of an embarrassing parent, Dai Youko revealed he has been keeping a picture diary of every moment in his daughter`s life, no matter how private. While he is initially dead-set against his daughter being together with http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita], he comes to change his mind, mainly because he is tricked into believing their relationship had already caused Youko to become pregnant. In past times, Dai Youko apparently defeated the evil wizard http://anidb.net/ch10272 [Sekidousai] in single combat. The reason he came up against the Kawahira family is that he wanted to conquer their mountain so his daughter would have a place to nap.",
