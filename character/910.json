  "description" : "Wurmple is a larval Pokémon common in both the Hoenn region and the Sinnoh region. It can be considered the modern counterpart to earlier larval Pokémon species Caterpie and Weedle. A common target for avian Pokémon such as Swellow and Staravia, the generally weak Wurmple attempts to defend itself with the spikes on its tail and head which secrete poison, and it can spit slimy thread to slow down opponents. Otherwise, Wurmple feeds by peeling the bark off trees and feeds on the oozing sap. Its feet are tipped with suction pads that allow it to cling to glass without slipping. Wurmple can evolve into either Cascoon or Silcoon (Silcoon---Beautifly and Cascoon---Dustox) depending on what kind of trainer is training it.\nIn the Pokémon anime, recurring female trainers May and Jessie each catch a Wurmple, and their rivalry is reflected in the differing forms the Wurmple evolve into; May`s Wurmple becomes a Silcoon that eventually evolves into a Beautifly, while Jessie`s Wurmple becomes a Cascoon that eventually evolves into a Dustox.",
