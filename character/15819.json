  "description" : "Priscilla is a pink-haired girl who met Van for the first time in an armor battle tournament. She loves to pilot her armor and gives all the prize money she wins to the efforts of her sister, Johanna, in raising orphans. Both were raised by a former Armor pilot-turned-nun who was the original owner of Brownie, Priscilla`s Armor. She controls her armor through a control interface system which allows her movements to be directly mimicked by her armor, thus taking advantage of her athletic abilities. Priscilla is a firm believer in fair play, and refused a big company`s bribe to throw a championship fight. Her personality is somewhat naive and is almost always cheerful. She later joins Van`s company and also gains a crush on him, much to Wendy`s chagrin. She is not afraid to show her feelings for Van. The Eldorado Five even once enthusiastically encouraged her to propose a marriage to him, seeing her strong feelings. Priscilla settled on a first date instead, since it was too soon to be considering marriage. In the end, her date is postponed when Van suddenly departs after fulfilling his mission to kill the Claw and avenging his wife. Priscilla vows to one day find him and have that date.\nAnother thing which seems to irritate Wendy (and Carmen), is that Van managed to remember Priscilla`s name almost right away after their first meeting, while he didn`t manage to remember Carmen`s name before the very last episode.",
