  "description" : "Vai Low, the 57th Sevaar known as Scarface, is the most powerful warrior in the history of Kuruda. Receiving the title of High-Sevaar at the age of 16 when he defeated King Iba Sutra, the 55th Sevaar Hawk Eyes, in combat, he became the heir to the throne and a role model for the new generation of Vaar to follow. He seems to take a liking to Gau and Elle, Gau most especially. Like all Sevaar, he tends to put up an aloof air whenever he is in public, not even glancing at his own wife, Folstise, the Ordo Codex of Juliannes. He also seems to have something of a drinking problem, always having an extra bottle of booze sneaked into his cape.\nWhen Gau Ban first traveled to Kuruda, Vai immediately recognized his potential. Throughout the series, he has played a prominent role in the molding of young Gau. He usually influences Gau in an indirect manner, such setting up battles for him to fight. At other times he would act like a father figure and give him advice that is completely in contrast to the ones given by Diaz. He is actually obsessed in making Gau in to the ultimate warrior, and as such he constantly seeks to test him somehow. Unbeknownst to Gau and the others, Vai is actually the elder son of Shere Kahn, founder of Yin-ryuu, and the older brother of Gau.",
