  "description" : "Plue`s body is a pure white creature with a yellow horn-like nose. It`s always trembling, and it can only say \"puun\". Its favorite food is candy. When it`s hungry or enters a bath, its body and nose become shrivelled. Hiro Mashima, the author of the manga, has said that Plue feels close to a stuffed animal. It`s age and gender are a mystery.\nIn Groove Adventure Rave, Plue is a strange creature that Haru discovered, Plue is the Rave Bearer, and is able to sense the presence of the other Rave Stones. Plue`s nose also has the ability to destroy Dark Bring. It has the ability to utilise the Rave of Combat, which powers itself and Haru up.\nIn Fairy Tail, Plue is a Silver Key Celestial Spirit officially called \"Nicola the Canis Minor\", but named Plue by its summoner Lucy. Its only unique ability is magic cancellation, and so serves more as a pet for Lucy.",
