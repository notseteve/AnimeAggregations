The Pokédex is a convenient tool that is a self-learning type and it updates and records information about the Pokémon Ash encounters and catches during his journey in the Alola region. He received the dex from Professor Kukui to support him in his travels.\nIt`s known as the Rotom Pokédex because unlike a normal electronic dex, it`s inhabited by Rotom, a Pokémon with the power to reside in various electronic appliances. The Rotom Pokédex sparkles with its own personality and shows the current location and the next destination. The Rotom Zukan has been programmed to communicate with humans and comes with many languages built in. It also gives advice on where to go next, based on the conversations he had with others.",
