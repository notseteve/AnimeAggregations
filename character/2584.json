  "description" : "Ophelia is ranked Claymore #4. Though powerful, she grows increasingly unstable, displaying sadistic and sociopathic tendencies. She murders humans and fellow Claymores to sate her bloodlust, killing any and all who witness her transgressions so that they will not come to light. She also enjoys torturing and played sadistic \"games\" with her opponents in battle. Ophelia usually talks in a very feminine and polite way, but once something doesn`t work out the way she wants it to or somebody disturbs her \"having fun\", she changes to a very vulgar, masculine tone. Even though many of her crimes remain undiscovered, or at least unproven, many of the Claymores who have met or worked alongside Ophelia are aware of her monstrous nature.",
