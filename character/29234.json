He is able to give a fraction of his own power to other Specters, and has direct command over Nasu Veronica, who shares the pentagram on his forehead. Using Tartarus` Phobia, Thanatos can summon a large number of souls that attacks the enemy and with Terrible Providence, Thanatos creates a powerful energy blast capable of destroying even the Gold Cloths. In his fight against Cancer Manigoldo and the Pope Sage, his host body is killed by Manigoldo, and his soul sealed by Sage inside a Holy Coffer empowered by Athena.",
