  "description" : "A strong-minded man and a fearsome warrior who gained the title of \"thunder god\", he is in love with Ashura-Ou and \"will do anything to get what I want.\" Therefore, Taishakuten made a deal with Ashura-Ou: he could have the Ashura king, but had to fulfil his wish of preventing Ashura`s son from becoming a God of Destruction.\nThis leads to the painful act of him eating Ashura-Ou later, as Ashura-Ou said this is the only way for him to have strength to rebel against the Emperor. Taishakuten then successfully killed the Emperor and got the title himself, becoming a tyrant just to fulfil one wish of the man he loved. According to Taishakuten, living alone without your loved one is extremely painful, as he had always suffered being without Ashura-Ou.",
