  "description" : "A young boy from the same class as Mikan. He has the Alice that involves reading a person`s mind, causing him to repeat them out loud and often making situations worse. He uses this against Mikan while she was being attacked by Mochu`s alice telekinesis. He is not a bad person though, this is due to the fact that he cannot help using his ability. He is best friends with Kitsunume, who holds the flying alice. Like Kitsunume, he has an innocent crush on Misaki Harada. He is also very much aware of Ruka`s feelings towards Mikan, which is why he is part of the Watching Over Ruka group.",
