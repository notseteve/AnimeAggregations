  "description" : "Tomoe`s girlfriend. While she looks like an innocent and clumsy girl, popular with boys (who nickname her \"Princess\"), her true self is quite different, having a devilish, bad-mannered personality, always prone to bad-mouth or tease other people. Tomoe seems to be the only one able to \"control\" her; they are always together, and for this reason they had no friends before knowing Sumika and the others. Miyako is a daughter of Hachisuka family`s driver, a fact that doesn`t sit well with the rest of Tomoe`s household but as with other things, they cannot go against her.",
