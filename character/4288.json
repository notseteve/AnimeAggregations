She is assigned to investigate Miharu`s sudden disappearance and comes to Earth, but is moved by Miharu and Yukinari`s feelings for each other and ends up returning to Earth with Miharu. Her reason for working at the department was because she`d lost her father as a young girl. However her man allergies are so severe, that her job is often compromised.
