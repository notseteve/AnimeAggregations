  "description" : "Gil Graham, commonly known simply as Graham, is an aging Englishman and one of the few people from Earth with a magical aptitude. Aria and Lotte Liese, his twin catgirl familiars, used to be Chrono Harlaown`s teachers in close combat and magic. Graham introduces himself to Nanoha, Fate and Chrono with one request: not to betray their friends. It is later revealed that he had been supporting Hayate, planning for her to complete the Tome of Darkness and seal her away with it, believing that few people would have to mourn an orphan like her, and wanting her to be happy before she had to be sealed away. His plan fails and he gives the Durandal to Chrono to help him and Nanoha`s group destroy the corrupted defense program. He resigns from his position after the incident and promises to tell Hayate the truth when she is ready to live on her own.",
