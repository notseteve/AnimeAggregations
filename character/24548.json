  "description" : "Takumi is a student of the Beach Pok√©mon School. Dawn and her friends were asked by Johanna`s if they would help out at the school.\nTakumi started off as a trouble maker and a bit of a brat. He pulled Dawn`s Piplup`s face and teased it a lot to the point that it got mad and started chasing him. He also wasn`t impressed that Dawn and friends were his teachers but he eventually turned around after Dawn showed him her contest combination moves.\nAfter Pachirisu and Buneary were able to perfect Dawn`s new combination move, he and Piplup both were cheering them as they attempted the move. Takumi and Piplup found a common ground while they were cheering and became friends and splashed around in the water.",
