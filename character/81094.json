  "description" : "Serpico is one of the main characters of the series. He is a servant and illegitimate son of the noble Vandimion family who would join http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts]` Traveling Party along with his half-sister http://anidb.net/ch81096 [Farnese]. He is polite in manner, and very loyal, sincere, and protective of Farnese.\nHe is a slender young man with blond hair. His most notable feature is that his eyes are closed at almost all times, except for when he is very serious. He is often compared to a fox because of this. While a member of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, Serpico wore silvery-white armor around a green shirt with matching scarf and skirt. After leaving the Iron Chain Knights, Serpico wears traveler`s garbs prior to receiving the Sylph Cloak. In combat, Serpico is a deft fencer, very clever and cunning.\nFrom his terrible life on the streets, he has grown to show very little emotion, often hiding his true feelings behind a facade of incompetence or sarcasm. He is scared of fire and dislikes the sight of blood, which makes him an unlikely warrior. He learned from growing up poor that revenge only brings more revenge, and avoids creating these situations. Farnese would sometimes force him into duels with other nobles that insulted his honor, but, though he was always far better than his opponent, he chose to purposefully end it in a draw, as he was well aware that the nobles would want revenge. Serpico views Farnese as his guardian angel for saving him from his miserable life on the streets, and does not hate her, despite that she condemned his demented mother for being a heretic (when she, quite obviously, was not), and forced him to burn her himself. \nSource: Berserk Wiki",
