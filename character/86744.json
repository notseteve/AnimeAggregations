  "description" : "Lurantis is a Grass-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Fomantis when leveled up in the day starting at level 34.\nLurantis is an insectoid Pokémon with some plant-like features. The top half of its head is pink, while the bottom half is white. It has light red eyes and two green antennae with a small green lump between them. There are four extensions to the top half of its head: two on the top with red tips that resemble ears, and one on each side with white tips that are similar to stylized hair. It has a light pink body with short extensions around the waist and a green abdomen and neck. Its thin, white arms end in large, red scythes white along the bottom rim and a single green claw are the tip. There are vertical, pink-and-red stripes down its legs, which have small, pointed green feet. The coloring and shape of Lurantis`s body and arms give it the appearance of wearing a long-sleeved dress, while its legs are similar to pants. Four red, wing-like appendages sprout from its back, each tipped with white.\nLurantis both looks and smells like a flower, a trait that it exploits to lure in foes so it can spring a surprise attack. Its brilliant coloration and elegant moves earn it acclaim as the most gorgeous Grass-type Pokémon. Maintaining its appearance requires detailed grooming. If a Trainer does a good job caring for it, Lurantis will have an easier time trusting them than a lazy Trainer.",
