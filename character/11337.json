  "description" : "Sakurai Kanade is a high school junior and http://anidb.net/ch11338 [Yukino]`s younger twin, although generally considered more mature than her sister. She is also somewhat easy to ruffle emotionally, especially by Yukino. She often worries that Yukino is sacrificing herself for her benefit. Kanade is an artist and wants to pursue art studies, but she understands that it would be difficult to pursue a career in the field and maintain a close relationship with Yukino.\nSource: English Wikipedia",
