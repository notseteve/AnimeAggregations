  "description" : "The Shuzack currently serves as the personal Gunman of Cytomander. Whereas the Sayrune was best-suited for underwater combat, the Shuzack is more adapted to aerial superiority, sporting a compact flight engine and a massive winged design. Additionally, its multi-jointed frame allows for both arms to both extend and retract in close-quarter situations. Its torso also holds a deadly buzzsaw.\nThe Shuzack is destroyed, along with its pilot, when it got in the way of the Dai-Gurren ramming into the Dai-Gunten. Like the custom Gunman of the other Generals, the Shuzack can also transform.\nHowever the full extent of its abilities are unknown, as the Shuzack was immediately destroyed following it`s transformation.",
