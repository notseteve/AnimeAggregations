She can hide herself from the eye of others at will. She was grown up in the same orphanage as Seto and Kano.\nShe has tomboy personality but still shows some womanly acts at time. her extreme introvert nature makes her look odd to others.\nJust like the other members of the group, she acquired her ability after having a near death experience. She and her sister were trapped in house fire and got caught in a void Space (Heat Haze), her sister was swallowed by the haze and saves Kido by forcing her to escape. Tateyama Family laer adopted her along with Kano and Seto.\nKido`s song is: \"Mekakushi Code\" Which is mostly about the group rather than her own life.\nSource: Wikipedia",
