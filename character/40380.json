  "description" : "Doyle`s Solosis helped Officer Jenny (Isshu) try to figure out what was happening to the Tabunne. Doyle`s Solosis is generally seen out of its Pok√© Ball floating beside Doyle.\nWhile they were tracking a Tabunne in a foggy forest, Doyle mistakenly thought that Ash and his friends might be related to the incidents when they saw them trying to talk to the staggering Tabunne. Doyle quickly apologized for getting Doyle`s Solosis to use Pyschic on them.\nDoyle relies on his Solosis`s Pyschic for attacking as well as for strategic movements. When they were tracking the Tabunne, he told his Solosis to use Pyschic to lift everyone up the side of the cliff after the Tabunne pulled up the ladder so they couldn`t get up.",
