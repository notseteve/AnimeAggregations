  "description" : "A member of the Nine Soldiers in the movie \"A Tale of Perishing.\" From the Kingdom of Mechanics. He was chosen to become one of the Nine Soldiers for his ability to detect the coming of the Void. His special skill is forecasting the weather, though he often gets it wrong. In combat, he can emit beams from his forehead, but his main role is gathering and analyzing information. He considers himself to be the brains of the Nine Soldiers, though he tends to enter sleep mode at critical moments, which is why Unio calls him useless. He is considerate, gentle, and kind-hearted.\nSource: Official X",
