  "description" : "The Hizack is the first new model of mobile suit produced by the Earth Federation Forces after the One Year War. Based on Zeon`s versatile MS-06 Zaku II, the Hizack incorporates a mixture of Zeon and Federation technologies, but it`s essentially an improved Zaku rather than a genuinely new machine. New armour materials and a lightweight power generator make the Hizack lighter and more agile than its ancestor, and thanks to its ease of operation and maintenance it`s become the standard mobile suit of the regular Federation Forces and Titans alike. However, its inability to drive more than one type of beam weapon at a time means that the Hizack is often equipped with an obsolete machine gun rather than a beam rifle.",
