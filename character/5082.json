  "description" : "Sakura Hiromi is classmate of http://anidb.net/ch5080 [Suzuka] in school. She moved to the village one year after the Tomosaka family; she helps out in http://anidb.net/ch39837 [her family]`s convenience store. She is a soft-spoken and timid girl who doesn`t make friends easily. She loves desserts (Anmitsu, Mitsumame); her favorite drink is Ramune, and a certain Ramune bottle is her most precious treasure because of a certain event in the past causing her infatuation on Suzuka`s older brother http://anidb.net/ch5077 [Kenji]. She once had a similar hairpin (a blue fish) as http://anidb.net/ch5078 [Nanami] but gave it to Kenji as a present.\nDespite being aware that she must not get between her senpais Kenji and Nanami whom she considers \"made for each other\" she tells Kenji her feelings after she learned that her family has to move away from this village once again; she also warns the couple to not take everything they have for granted, thus giving their relation a push forward.",
