They also possess the Vongola Rings, seven invaluable rings which have been around since the founding of the Mafia underworld and are usually in possession of the main members known as the Vongola Guardians.They are also rich in various traditions,most notably the Vongola Tournament, a traditional battle in which two groups vie for the seven guardian positions.",
