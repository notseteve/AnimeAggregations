  "description" : "Trevor`s Charmander is Trevor`s starter Pokémon given to him by Professor Sycamore. It was first seen in the anime when it was running around shooting flames. Ash Ketchum noted it was very energetic. Shauna (XY) explained that is quick to pick up a fight and it`s always full of energy no matter the opponent. It particularly seemed fond of Clemont`s Chespin and it actually burned it with a flame.\nIn the first day battles at the Pokémon Summer Camp, Trevor`s Charmander actually faced off against Clemont`s Chespin. The type disadvantage was still quite evident from their earlier encounter but the results of the battle were not disclosed.",
