  "description" : "Leinas Rockbruise is the only female member of the http://anidb.net/ch97462 [Four Imperial Knights] of the http://anidb.net/ch95432 [Baharuth Empire].\nLeinas prioritizes her own life above all else, it is said that she is the least loyal among the Four Imperial Knights. She works for http://anidb.net/ch95433 [Jircniv] only because it is most profitable for her to do so, and will immediately abandon her position if someone else can provide her with what she wants.\nDue to her disfigured face, she is shown to be envious of other beautiful women. This was shown when she clicked her tongue whenever the men gave a compliment for the http://anidb.net/ch89828 [Pleiades] beauty which was enticing them.\nSource: Overlord Wiki",
