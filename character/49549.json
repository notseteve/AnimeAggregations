  "description" : "The Az-130 Panzerzorene is another Varauta-built variable fighter designed after obtaining UNS technology. When UN Forces investigated the fourth planet of the Varauta system and fell victim to the Protodeviln, the UNS VA-14 variable fighters were taken by the Varauta and redesigned for their needs. Like all adapted Varauta fighters the Az-130 is a heavy variable vehicle armed with five fixed weapons, two gun pods and six missile launchers. When deployed together the Az-130 can launch devastating attacks firing dozens of missiles each to launch massive fusillades against the enemy. The Panzerzorene is also equipped with a spiritia absorption beam mounted on the right side of the head unit in Battroid mode. The heavy firepower and strong armor of the Panzerzorene is a significant advantage for the variable fighter when in battle against lighter enemy units. However, as a larger variable vehicle some 15.5 metric tons in weight the Az-130 is slower to accelerate and less maneuverable the UNS variable fighters.\nThe Az-130A standard model variable fighter entered service later in the Protodeviln War along side the http://anidb.net/ch49550 [FBz-99 Saubergeran] in November 2045. The Az-130 squadrons were operated by captured Zentradi pilots from the Macross 5 fleet and forced to fight under the mind control technology of the Protodeviln.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/az-130a.htm",
