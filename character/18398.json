  "description" : "Mira Clay is the leader of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance and was a Vexos for a short time. Using the Subterra attribute, she uses Baliton as her Trap Bakugan and uses Magma Wilda as her Guardian Bakugan. She is a 16 year old Vestal. Her father is Professor Clay, a scientist, and her brother is Spectra Phantom (Keith Clay). When she first played Bakugan, she thought of them as just unintelligent creatures. That was until she witnessed a tortured Alpha Hydranoid speak out in vengeance, it was then that she realized that Bakugan were alive, and so she started the Resistance with Baron and Ace.\nSource: bakugan.wikia.com",
