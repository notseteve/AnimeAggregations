  "description" : "Kyouko`s parents. Initially against Kyouko`s marriage to Soichiro, they (especially her mother, Ritsuko) wish to see their daughter continue her life, preferably remarrying. Ritsuko is quite taken with Shun and sees him as a suitable husband for her daughter, while Kyouko`s father sees the handsome Shun as a potential womanizer who will only break his \"little girl`s\" heart. Neither of them seem to notice Yuusaku`s existence (their inability to remember his name is used as a running gag), let alone the bond both he and Kyouko share, and their obsession with Shun only frustrates Yuusaku. However, later on Ritsuko showed some support for Godai since she just wanted Kyouko to re-marry, and that at the time Shun was no longer an option to Kyouko (Shun had married Asuna). Both Ritsuko and Kyouko tend to address Mr. Chigusa as \"Daddy\" or \"Father\".",
