  "description" : "He originally doubted Yuuri, but Yuuri eventually gaines his trust by entrusting him with Morgif`s Jewel. This is Morgif`s source of power, and Yozak later returns it so Morgif can help Yuuri defend a human village from a stolen Holy Sword and its not-quite-human wielder.\nHe goes back a long way with Conrad: they`ve known each other since they were children. Yozak and Conrad are the only survivors of the Lütenburg army, a portion of the army of Shin Makoku that fought in the past war with the humans for the mazoku. The Lütenburg warriors were all half-human half-mazoku fighters that wished to prove their loyalty to Shin Makoku. Halfbloods were - and are - looked down upon by both mazoku and humans because of the hatred between the races.\nIt can only be assumed that as relations between the species change, so will the treatment of halfbreeds. Yuuri`s efforts to unite humans and mazoku are one of the main reasons Yosak supports Yuuri. He is the first one to find out that Murata Ken is the person with the soul of the Great Sage, the Original King`s trusted friend.",
