  "description" : "A teenage girl, who possesses the \"Mystic Eyes of Death Perception\", a supernatural ability that allows the user to see the inherent mortality of everything (both living and non-living) in the form of lines and a single point (which is the \"origin\" of the object). The eyes are illustrated by a rainbow-like colour in her pupils. A cut along any line will bifurcate the object, no matter the sharpness of cutting tool used, and a stab at the point destroys the object`s origin, causing instant death.",
