  "description" : "Palm Siberia (パーム=シベリア) is the pupil of Nov, for whom she has affections for. In order for her to accompany Nov on the extermination, Gon and Killua must defeat Knuckle and Shoot within one month, so Palm contacts Biscuit to train them further. On most occasions, she appears disheveled and stressed, exuding a frightening aura. However, she is depicted as quite beautiful when dressed up. She develops a crush on Gon, but is unable to further their relationship. Palm can see the location of anyone she has seen with her own eyes by using a small mermaid crystal ball relic fed by her blood.\nSource: Wikipedia",
