  "description" : "Aoki Kou (real name, Aoki Yuriko (青木 優梨子)) is an aspiring female mangaka that only recently began to work in the shonen genre, previously having worked exclusively as a shoujo manga author. Aoki is a beautiful woman a couple of years older than http://anidb.net/ch16785 [Mashiro] and http://anidb.net/ch16787 [Takagi], which her editor believes will help her sales. She is distrustful of men, as she draws a number of suitors interested in her appearance, including her assistant http://anidb.net/ch19967 [Nakai Takurou], whose advances she rejects a number of times. Because shoujo art styles do not match well with Jump, she initially needs help from assistants and artists in order to be published. She is initially paired with Nakai for her first series, Hideout Door. After Hideout Door is cancelled, Aoki resolves to return to shoujo, although she is later convinced to stay on working for Shonen Jump. She is now working on the serialized series The Time of Green Leaves, which is an ecchi series, although she now does her own drawings with assistance on the ecchi portions from http://anidb.net/ch19975 [Fukuda Shinta].\nSource: Wikipedia",
