  "description" : "* Ability: Turn one second into ten seconds for herself\n* Ability Level 2: Double her attack power\nShe uses this power to make her look like she`s using super speed. Her Level 2 is the ability to double her attack power, but it`s only limited to 10 minutes. When she activates it, a gauge appears on her neck and she will collapse after the gauge empties. Reason of her defeat is her level 2.\nMarylin, along with the rest of her team, grew up in a war zone in an unnamed country, so they spent their lives in training. Once the war was over, her family joined the upper class. She claims to be proud of her upbringing and how she only feels truly alive when she is fighting, but this is a facade. She holds onto a childhood promise to her dead war buddies that forces her to keep fighting, despite her actual distaste for the act.",
