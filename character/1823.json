  "description" : "The Anti-Spiral is the ultimate villain of Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann, and the central antagonistic presence for the final two story arcs. He first appears as a disembodied voice in episode twenty four, but is formally introduced in episode twenty six. His physical form is a chaos of arbitrary human concepts fluctuating on a black silhouette, with cartoonish gestures and exaggerated expressions.\nAnti-Spiral is both the leader and collective mental manifestation of the \"Anti-Spiral Race\" after they seal themselves away to purge their race of Spiral energy. The highly advanced technology bequeaths onto him extensive, almost supernatural powers, which manifest in the form of red energy. With these abilities he is able to manipulate physical and chemical laws (going as far as altering probability), which he does regularly both offensively and as a form of intimidation. The Anti-Spiral is the nemesis of Lordgenome, being responsible for Lordgenome`s madness after explaining the nature of Spiral Nemesis to him.\nBeyond what is known of the Anti-Spirals, little is known of the Anti-Spiral personally. He has the mannerisms of a scientist, suggesting he had a hand in both the creation of Anti-Spiral technology and the decision to undergo the millennia-long battle against the Milky Way`s spiral beings. The Anti-Spiral is very proud and holds deep contempt for spiral beings, specifically Simon, frustrated him that across all of time, spiral beings still resist limiting their populations and continue to defy the resolution of his race and their ideology.",
