  "description" : "Her Brain Burst avatar is Black Lotus, also known as \"World End,\" a slender robot with a feminine form which features limbs ending in sharp blades. These weapons instantly cut anything they touch due to the \"Absolute Cutting Property\" the avatar possesses, which has the side effect of permanently removing whatever is cut from an opponent`s avatar. However, the blades have a frail lateral portion that breaks after receiving too much damage. To compensate for this weakness, Kuroyukihime developed a technique she calls \"Soft Act\". Black Lotus has three special abilities: Death by Barraging, Death by Embracing, which was used on Red Rider, and Death by Piercing, a one-hit-kill direct attack; and two incarnate system skills: Vorpal Strike and Star Burst Stream. Lotus also displays an ability called Overdrive: Mode Green, which causes the purple parts of its body to turn green and increase its speed and attack power for a limited time. Lacking feet, Black Lotus hovers slightly off the ground via air jets on the legs, with which it is able to achieve incredible speeds.\nSource: Wiki",
