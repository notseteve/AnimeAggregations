  "description" : "Full Name: Nemesis La Algol\nGargoyle is the main antagonist. He is head of the Neo-Atlantean forces. He was the prime minister of Tartessos, and his main objectives are:\nDestroy Nemo and the Nautilus,\nTake possession of the Blue Waters\nDominate over the entire world and humans, whom he considers inferior.\nHe is a cunning yet brutal villain who speaks in a soft voice and taps into other people`s weaknesses to make them comply with his wishes. We never see the face behind the mask until the final episode (and even then, his face is only briefly shown before he dies).\nHis name is also a mix of Latin and Greek mythology, as for Nemo and Electra.\nHe considers himself an Atlantean, but he is not aware of the fact that he is one of the humans that he despises, as the mere creation of the Atlantean technology.",
