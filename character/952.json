  "description" : "Nosepass is a Pokemon species found in the Hoenn region. Nosepass appears as a rocky-but-animate figurine vaguely in the shape of an Easter Island statue. It lives in caves and comes across as immobile because it is often found standing still in these environments. However, Nosepass displays behavior commonly associated with predatorial animals in the wild as well, hunting and feeding on prey that might be foolish enough to approach it. Its full body emits a powerful force of magnetism which it uses to pull its prey towards it like a tractor beam before feeding. This sense of magnetism is naturally bolstered in cold seasons.\nThe nose of Nosepass is undoubtedly its most notable feature. It is the focal point of Nosepass` magnetic nature, and this works to make Nosepass something of a living compass. When seen standing idly, it is consistently facing the North Pole as directed by its magnetic nose. Travelers who encounter this Pokemon can therefore actually use the placement of a Nosepass to check the direction of north and get their bearings. However, close observation has revealed that the Pokemon is affected by polar drift; With each passing year, Nosepass` direction shifts slightly at a rate of 3/8 of an inch each year. Since all Nosepass have noses of the same magnetism, if two of these Pokemon meet, they cannot turn their faces towards each other when they are close because their magnetic noses repel one another.\nIn the fourth generation of Pokemon media, if a Nosepass is brought to the Sinnoh region and it gains a level of experience while inside Mt. Coronet, it will evolve into Probopass.",
