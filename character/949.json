  "description" : "Makuhita is a basic species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. Makuhita has a spirit that is tireless, gutsy, and tenacious. They are said to never give up hope, even against physically superior opponents. Its daily routine is said to involve a lot of harsh training, much like the Pokémon Machop, and its training increases its power and durability. It is thought that Makuhita regularly train in the secluded environs of a cave, and people around these caves have often reported hearing rumbling tremors from within the caves. Its body training is noted to always be accompanied by ample food consumption and sleep, for it is the goal of a Makuhita to gain enough weight and body mass to evolve into its bigger, fatter form of Hariyama.",
