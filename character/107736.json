  "description" : "Perrserker is a Steel-type Pok√©mon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves from Galarian Meowth starting at level 28.\nUnlike Persian, Perrserker remains bipedal with a body shape similar to what it had as a Meowth. The hair on its head and parts of its limbs has hardened into natural armor. The former takes the shape of a stereotypical horned Viking helmet that covers its ears and part of its eyes while also incorporating its coin. Perrserker`s claws have grown longer and harder as well, and can come together to form daggers that it can use to fight its foes more effectively.\nPerrserker has a violent and barbaric demeanor and lives for the thrill of battle. It and Persian have a relationship characterized by mutual disdain on account of the irreconcilable differences in their respective temperaments.",
