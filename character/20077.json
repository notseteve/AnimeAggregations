  "description" : "A purely fun loving entertainer it`s Excellen`s habit to tease younger and thus less experienced crew-members, especially Bullet, on private matters like relationships, always speaking in an unserious cutey-girly manner. She`s always first to add weird nicknames on others and intentionally mistakes idioms for some daily slapstick. Though showing this light hearted attitude most of the time, she still knows to act serious on occasions, as indeed she is very skilled in range fight and dodging attacks. Despite his cold treatment of her on the outside, she deeply loves her Kyousuke, always supporting him either on battlefield or financially after another lost bet. She`s also a hard-drinking woman, accompanying her superiors at times, as she just loves to entertain.",
