  "description" : "This interceptor mobile suit is introduced as a replacement for the obsolete GM II, and soon becomes the backbone of the AEUG resistance group and its terrestrial Karaba allies. For cost reasons the Nemo is armoured with the older Gundarium Alpha alloy, which is identical to the Luna Titanium used during the One Year War. Nonetheless, it`s better protected than the GM II on which it`s based, and more manoeuvrable as well.",
