  "description" : "Developed at the Titans` Kilimanjaro base, this prototype mobile suit is designed for high-speed atmospheric flight. The Byalant`s thermonuclear jet engines let it accelerate rapidly and remain airborne for extended periods. To reduce its weight, the Byalant has mega particle cannons built into its forearms rather than an external beam rifle, but as a result its manipulator hands are fairly rudimentary and its melee combat capabilities relatively poor. Once its thrusters are replaced with standard rocket engines, the Byalant proves to be an effective space fighter as well.",
