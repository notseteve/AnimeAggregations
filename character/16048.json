  "description" : "Cleo is 12 years old mech pilot who looks like a teenager which her friend Lee makes fun of her for being extremely developed for her age. She`s a quick learner, but despite this she is very clumsy and somewhat a slow thinker with other things. She states that her positive skills are cooking, laundry, and keeping watch without even getting tired. She and Lee graduated from military school after 2 years, when it ordinarily takes 6 years.\nLee later commits suicide to prevent from being captured under the belief that the enemy are barbarians, but Cleo believes Rygart killed her and initially wanted to kill him. After this, she meets Rygart in battle and shows a surprising amount of skill contrary to how she was before, almost fighting off Rygart. She is defeated shortly after securing Zess`s escape and taken prisoner, where she is treated very leniently and shares a room with Sigyn. She initially tries to escape by securing Sigyn`s gun and tries to kill Rygart, but fails because the gun actually had no ammo. She befriends Sigyn and doesn`t try to escape afterward.",
