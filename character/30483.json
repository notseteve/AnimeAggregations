  "description" : "As a child Sally lived and worked beside the Skyarrow Bridge with her father and Gothitelle. She and her Gothitelle would hand out juice and sweets to the passengers that were being ferried across the river while the Skyarrow bridge was under construction. When the bridge was completed, Sally and her father moved away as there was no need for a boat to ferry people across any longer.\nSally moved to a town where her uncle was working in a factory but she quickly transferred to a boarding school where she began studying to become a doctor. Sally`s Gothitelle had to stay behind as she studied. During that time, Sally`s Gothitelle became lonely and nostalgic as it remembered the good times they had together while working on the boat.\nYears later, Sally returned to the Skyarrow Bridge the day that Ash and his friends were crossing it. Ash almost ran into Sally as they were both entering a store at the on-ramp to the Skyarrow Bridge. Sally saw the pictures on the stores wall of the old boat and remembered the good times she had with her Gothitelle. While attempting to cross the bridge, Ash and his friends were caught in an illusionary Time Slip created by Sally`s Gothitelle and they then saw the younger Sally there.\nWhile Ash and his friends were battling Gothitelle in the Time Slip attempting to return back to their time, the adult Sally appeared and tried to calm her Gothitelle down by explaining that she had become a qualified doctor now and had been transferred to a hospital nearby. She calmed Gothitelle down by telling it that she missed it very much and missed the happy days they had together.",
