  "description" : "Owned by Haruna, Hamtarou is a courageous Ham-Ham who`s always ready to help out his friends and his owner Haruna. However, he cannot stand being ignored by Haruna. He is clueless about many things being that he is of an innocent nature, especially love (much to Bijou`s dismay). Hamtarou makes the most of his life as a small hamster and lives each day in happiness hoping to make more friends and have fun. In the original anime, Hamtarou ends his sentences with `na no da`, a phrase often used by playful characters.",
