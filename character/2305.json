  "description" : "The head butler, who used to be in the special forces, and whose real name is Taijiri Yasushi. He believes himself to be incredibly handsome. In the anime, he frequently parodies other anime series, most notoriously Mobile Fighter G Gundam, as part of an in-joke referring to the fact that his and Ren`s voice actors played major roles in that series. There are some hints that point out the Colonel has homosexual tendencies, however this could also be false and used as a device for yaoi innuendo jokes. While very hard on Ren by pushing him to the limit in his butler training, he is in reality an honourable man and believes in Ren. The colonel`s entire body is covered in scars from the time he spent in the special forces however they are usually covered by his butler uniform.",
