  "description" : "The Order of Magdalene is an organization of the Catholic Church that banishes devils and demons to Hell. The Order has many branches around the country; each one is presided over by the Council of the Catholic Church. The New York Branch of the Order is headed by Kate Valentine and Ewan Remington, who lead the fight against the forces of darkness. The Order has many members; however, in times of great crisis, other less generally accepted individuals may be introduced into the Order to help fight the forces of darkness.\nThey use various weapons, including various guns and swords. Guns use Sacred, standard bullets containing Holy Water, and Gospel, bullets with alchemized silver. Tetragramaton, a gun with high power against demons with low backlash, is given to Chrono. Besides using guns, there are members of Order with special powers as well, using devices like tomes, violins, or dolls. They also use Angel Capture Fields, specialized barriers that can repel demons, their power, and other astral based substances, and Soul Dive, an experimental system used to dive into souls. The order uses the Barrier Ship \"Metatron\" during great crisis.\n(Wikipedia)",
