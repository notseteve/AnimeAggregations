  "description" : "The Acguy is an amphibious mobile suit derived from the Gogg, which emphasizes stealth over brute power. It`s often used for reconnaissance and infiltration missions, as when Char Aznable leads a team of Acguys in a guerilla attack on the Federation Forces` Jaburo headquarters. The Acguy`s extendable right arm houses a mega particle cannon and a set of sharp claws, while its left arm contains a battery of rocket launchers.",
