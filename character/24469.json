  "description" : "Ash and his friends first met Looker on the Denryu Train on route to Lake Acuity. He had too many boxed lunches which he dropped while walking by Ash and friends.\nDisguised as a Team Galactic member, together with Team Rocket, he ambushed the grunts that were guarding the entrance to Spear Pillar. After assuming their places, he managed to establish a contact with champion Cynthia and let her know of Team Galactic`s actions. While waiting for her, he was able to discover who was the evil team`s boss when Cyrus arrived at the site along with the commanders. However, they immediately saw through their disguises and consequently, he and Team Rocket were taken prisoners. He was later rescued by Cynthia, and was left keeping watch over Jupiter and some of Team Galactic`s members that were kept captive, while she, along with Ash and his friends, followed Cyrus and the commanders to Spear Pillar.\nAfter the evil team`s plan had been thwarted, it was shown that he wondered where Team Rocket left off to, as they had mysteriously disappeared.",
