A mysterious woman who is aware of the existence of shadow beings in this town as both the unnamed protagonist and http://anidb.net/ch9748 [Tamaki Maiko] happen to observe.\nHer job at school only serves as excuse so that she can be close to the unnamed protagonist and fix any malfunctions of the virtual world (symbolized by extracting the shadow out of the http://anidb.net/ch39676 [tortured girl]`s body) before her brother-in-law will notice anything. She is fully aware of the heavy load she has agreed to put on the shoulder of her younger sister http://anidb.net/ch19491 [Mutsuki] and questions the meaning of the http://anidb.net/ch39798 [Pandora Project] because of this.",
