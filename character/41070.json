  "description" : "It is questionable what Meso is, because even though the cute, little yellow munchkin with a blue mustache for eyebrows is the mascot of the team, its zipper (located on his back) has opened various times and various other lifeforms have emerged from inside. Meso`s usual comment is \"Mokyu\". It has been known to be extremely violent when threatened, and has an impressive set of fangs and claws. It was found on either a spaceship or in a coffee shop called \"Dosukoi Kissa Je T`aime,\" depending on the club members` opinions.\nWikipedia",
