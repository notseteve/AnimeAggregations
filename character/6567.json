  "description" : "A first year in high school, Misaki is close friends with http://anidb.net/ch6569 [Meguru] and http://anidb.net/ch6568 [Yuu], as well as the next door neighbor and childhood friend of the Zaitsu brothers. She has a very open relationship with her neighbors, and even comes into http://anidb.net/ch6561 [Mamoru]`s room through his window, and is the only character in the series who`s not afraid of http://anidb.net/ch6565 [Misao] (in fact she often has casual conversations with him). She somehow knows submission techniques, and can perform them instinctively in her sleep. Though she claimed she had no interest in relationships at the moment, she developed an interest for http://anidb.net/ch6566 [Yuuji Arihara] when he shoved a lollipop in her mouth (showing an example to his friend, Yoshihiko Bessho). But although she likes Yuuji, she is not used to feeling vulnerable around boys, because she`s usually cool and level headed.",
