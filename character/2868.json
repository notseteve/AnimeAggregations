  "description" : "The engineer and creator of Deathscythe, as well as co-creator of the spaceship Peacemillion and Duo`s mentor. He is distinguished by his long nose, mushroom-shaped hair and a long scar on his cheek. Sardonic and, like Doctor J, rather eccentric, he tends to describe Deathscythe as \"the ultimate work of art\", perhaps due to his specialization in stealth systems. A member of the Sweeper group, he was impressed by Duo cracking his security codes and offered to train him as a Gundam pilot.",
