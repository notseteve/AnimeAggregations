  "description" : "Usami is a member of S4 or Shooting Star Subaru-Sama, but quit afterward and is also a member of the crafts club. She is shown to have considerable leg power which she uses in the form of kicks. She is shown to be a good cook, partly because she lives on her own and has to cook her own meals. She blackmailed Kinjirou, with the picture of him and Subaru on a mock date, to be her boyfriend up until the end of their school fair. Kinjirou accepted because of the condition that she will not spread the photo with Subaru and Kinjirou going out together. However she later becomes friends with Kinjirou and the others and is implied to have fallen for Kinjirou. Her name is noted to sound similar to the Japanese word for rabbit which becomes the source of Kinjirou`s nickname for her; Usamin, her own nickname for him is \"stupid chicken\". She later allows Kinjirou to call her by her first name, Masamune. As a gag, Usami is shown to be able to attract ghosts if not living together with them perfectly (ghosts appear in her photos and randomly pops out in her apartment).\nSource: Wikipedia",
