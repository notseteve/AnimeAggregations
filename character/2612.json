  "description" : "Butch is one half of of the Team Rocket duo that occasionally runs across Ash Ketchum and friends in the Pokémon anime.\nButch`s partner is Cassidy, and she is one of the few that usually manages to get his name right- much to his frustration, everyone else calls him either \"Biff\", \"Bill\", \"Bob\", \"Hutch\", \"Butcher\", \"Patch\", \"Botch\" or \"Chuck\" (コサンジ Kosanji in Japanese). Sometimes when she gets it right, he, by habit, tries to correct her and ends up calling himself the incorrect name. Everyone getting his name wrong has become a running gag in the anime. This, of course, annoys him to no end. He once even said in frustration, \"That does it, I am changing my name.\"\nButch is named after Butch Cassidy, an American outlaw. His Japanese name, Kosaburo, is meant to diminish his status when compared to James. 二郎 Jirou is a name meaning \"second son,\" while 三郎 Saburou means \"third son.\" Kojiro (James) takes advantage of Jirou, while Kosaburo takes advantage of Saburou.",
