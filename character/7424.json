  "description" : "Not affiliated with the Arachna military, he is a \"lone rider\" with his partner, Brutus. He made a promise to find the purple spider Portia, supposed to be Brutus`s younger sister, and this promise keeps him joining the ranks of Arachna. He later joins up with Hunter and the others to prevent the Invectids from stealing the Oracle Keys. He is somewhat obsessed with rescuing Portia from the Invectids. Magma is a great admirer of the hero Quake; each time he sees Quake in action, he has tears streaming from his eyes. His weapon is a mace that can switch to a flail.",
