  "description" : "Professor Tsurarer is the leader of the Vanipeti Gang (バニプッチ団). Like all evil villains looking to control and enslave, his goal was to control the Unova region by stealing all the frozen food and give it to wild Pokémon to tame them. Once the Pokémon had memorized the delicious taste of the frozen food, the Pokémon will gladly follow his orders and he would then use their power. Professor Tsurarer decided to use a storehouse in Driftveil City to act as their headquarters and to store the frozen food but Linda and Charles realized something odd was going on when they noticed the trunks coming and going so often. Professor Tsurarer captured Linda and got his henchmen to tie her up but Charles and Ash came to her rescue.\nHis name is a pun on \"氷柱 tsurara\", the Japanese word for \"icicle\".\nVillain Mr. Freege\nThe Professor is also the villain Mr. Freege (フリージ男 Freegeotoko) and he revealed his true form when he was cornered by Charles and Ash. He wears a Freegeo mask and his persona is based off of a Freegeo but he wasn`t able to capture one as it was too strong for him to get it. Instead, his main Pokémon is a Vanirich but it was defeated by Charles. He and his henchmen were arrested by Officer Jenny (Isshu).",
