  "description" : "Ruri is Kosaki`s best friend. She is never afraid of speaking what is on her mind and she is very aggressive when giving punishment especially to Shu. She is always pushing Kosaki to get closer to Raku, and is doing the bold things which Kosaki often cannot. She regularly beats up Shu for his perverted comments, although Shuu sometimes has pearls of wisdom that she can respect.\nSource: Wiki",
