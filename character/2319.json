  "description" : "Kei`s uncle and doctor of the local clinic. Minoru is something of a lecherous rogue, continually making wolfish comments regarding the attractiveness of passing women, even in the hearing of his wife, who often retaliates with a measured degree of force. He is openly quite jealous of Kei`s relationship with Mizuho; he is more than a little perverted (in the Japanese sense of the word), but often covers for and helps Kei and Mizuho out (such as moving Kei`s goods into the married couple`s new quarters, purchasing a proper wedding ring for their private ceremony, and paying for an expensive hotel in Okinawa for their honeymoon).",
