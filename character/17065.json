  "description" : "Naoi Ayato is a human originally thought to be a non-player character (non-human) who initially is the vice president of the student council, but becomes the student council president after http://anidb.net/ch12093 [Tenshi] is demoted thanks to http://anidb.net/ch12092 [Yuri]`s plan to demoralize her. He is much stricter than http://anidb.net/ch12093 [Tenshi] was and his first action as president is to punish the http://anidb.net/ch15364 [SSS] for their constant disobedience. After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, he replaced his older twin brother after he died in an accident and become his father`s apprentice in pottery, but Naoi was not as good at the craft as his brother had been. After his father became ill and died as well, Naoi got the impression that his entire life was fake.",
