  "description" : "The Leda II was an Alliance cruiser which was notable for being the ship that http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli] died on.\nThe Leda II`s first notable mission was as the ship that Admiral Yang Wenli chose to travel with from http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] to Heinessen in 798 UC, for an extra-legal `inquiry`. When the Imperial fleet and http://anidb.net/ch1760 [Geiersberg Fortress] attacked Iserlohn in Yang`s absence, the Leda II took him back, serving as flagship of the small fleet of 5000 ships sent as reinforcements. In the ensuing battle, the Leda II was struck by enemy fire, but its shields held.\nIn July 799 UC, the Leda II also ferried Fleet Admiral Yang and his comrades off of Heinessen.\nThe Leda II eventually became part of the El Facil Revolutionary Reserve Force, which fought the combined fleets of Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard] at the Battle of the Corridor in 800 UC. When a truce was called and the Kaiser invited Yang for talks, Yang once again elected to take the Leda II. Representatives from the El Facil Revolutionary Government also attended. A Terraist ploy resulted in the ship being boarded by Terraist-controlled Imperial destroyers en route, and a slaughter ensued as the assassins hunted for Yang. With Yang`s subordinates having been informed of the threat to his life soon after the Leda II`s departure, the flagship http://anidb.net/ch82027 [Ulysses] managed to catch up to the Leda II`s position. http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian Mintz] and the http://anidb.net/ch6224 [Rosen Ritter] were too late, and Yang was assassinated. The Leda II was then evacuated.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
