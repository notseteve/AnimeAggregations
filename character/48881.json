  "description" : "The first of the MBR-04 series Destroids, the Tomahawk Mk I entered service in February 2007. Conceived as a non-variable combat robot designed to counter giant-sized infantry, the Tomahawk was built using OverTechnology taken researched from the crash of the alien space craft known as the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] in 1999. Once successfully tested, the Tomahawk became the basis for three other Destroid types and the improved Tomahawk Mk VI quickly followed in late 2007.\nThe Tomahawk Mk VI is the most heavily armed Destroid of the MBR-04 series and the most widely deployed model. Of the nearly 600 hundred Destroids aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] in February 2009, over 500 were Tomahawk Mk VI units. Armed with a wide array of weaponry suited to nearly any combat operation, the Tomahawk features particle cannons, missiles, machine guns, lasers and flamethrowers to unleash fire in any role from anti-personnel to anti-aircraft. The Mk VI version also features a retractable periscope and includes the option of mounting searchlight/missile packs in one or both mounts on either side of the top weapons bays.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/destroid-tomahawk.htm",
