  "description" : "During the 7th Space War, the United Nations Earth created the GS-9900 G-Falcon as a support fighter for its line of Gundam mobile suits. The G-Falcon was capable of docking with a Gundam to provide added firepower and mobility. Despite being produced during the 7th Space War, the G-Falcon was still compatible with the New United Nations Earth`s latest mobile suit, the GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X. The G-Falcon itself was armed with a pair of scattering beam cannons, two vulcan guns and an array of infrared homing missiles. Long after the war, a G-Falcon unit was salvaged and rebuilt by Satelicon, a guerilla group fighting against the machinations of the Space Revolutionary Army. In September A.W. 0015, the SRA destroyed Satelicon`s asteroid base after the group attempted to assassinate colonial leader Seidel Rasso. Afterwards, G-Falcon pilot Pala Sys helped Garrod Ran foil the SRA`s Operation Dahlia by destroying a converted colony laser. Pala then joined Garrod`s Vulture group just as the 8th Space War began between the SRA and New UNE.",
