  "description" : "Slaking is the evolved form of Vigoroth. Compared to its earlier, pre-evolved forms, the Slaking species features an anatomy much closer to that of a gorilla. Though extremely lazy, a Slaking`s body contains a great amount of pent-up energy, and if it must battle an opponent it can potentially exert devastating power. In fields where these Pok√©mon have been, large bare patches appear in the grass. This is from were it reaches out and pulls up and eats all of the grass in its vicinity. When it has all been eaten, it reluctantly moves to another spot.",
