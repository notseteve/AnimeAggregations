  "description" : "Kurusu Kanako is a friend to Kirino and Ayase, and like them also works as a model, but is also a budding idol and can sing and dance very well. Like Ayase she is also biased against otaku culture, but Ayase manages to trick her into cosplaying as the main character in Kirino`s favorite anime Stardust Witch Meruru for a contest, whose prize is a limited edition Stardust Witch Meruru figurine. She manages to win the contest because of her uncanny resemblance to the main character, and her ability to sing the anime`s main theme so well despite never having sung it before.",
