  "description" : "Toboe is the youngest of the group \"14 dog years\", often acting more like a puppy than a wolf. Toboe was raised as a pet by \"Granny\", an elderly woman, whom he accidentally killed in an unrestrained act of playfulness. The silver bracelets are all he has left of her. Toboe maintains an affection for humans that none of the other wolves can understand (with the exception of Blue).",
