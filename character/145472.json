  "description" : "The main antagonist of the Neo Egoist League Arc. He`s tall, handsome, and physically strong. Kaiser has a blonde choppy mullet with blue streaks, a tattooed red eyeliner, and a blue rose tattoo that begins from his neck and ends in his left hand. \nHe`s flamboyant, arrogant, and rude in his introduction, challenging Isagi and calling him a clown as he often uses theatrical descriptions thinking of himself as a superstar and the rest are small actors in his stage. However, he hides another side of him. He has his teammate Ness whom he treats like a servant, not like a friend.",
