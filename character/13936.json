  "description" : "\"Beast\" Princess of the Giat Empire, she is quite short-tempered, due to her harsh childhood, where people feared her, and she and Pacifica often argued after they met. She is a warrior princess skilled with her sword and magic, and manages to revive the giant floating fortress Skid used 5000 years ago in the Genesis Wars, with the help of the Dragoon, Natalie. Even though Senes is a skilled fighter and magic user, she is still just a little below Shannon`s fighting ability and cannot beat him even if she uses her magic and swordsmanship together. This was proven in a fight between her and Shannon. It should be noted that she lasted longer against Shannon than Chris did and that Shannon was one of her few defeats. After the fight, Senes gained some respect for Shannon as a fighter and Raquel as a mage and tactician. Along with two followers, Ruce and Drake, she fights using Gigas, a dragon-like being that is somewhat similar to a Dragoon, but cannot take the form of a person. Another follower, Eirote, seems to be her second in command. She is in charge of most technical work, such as rebuilding the Gigas and maintaining the Skid. Eirote is much kinder and more soft-hearted then Senes and often soothes the Beast Princess`s rough temper for others as well as occasionally keeping Senes in line.",
