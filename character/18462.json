  "description" : "Elucia or Elsie as she is commonly known, is a demon who was assigned to capture evil spirits that have escaped from hell. Her feather cloth (the floating scarf she is always seen with) can change the appearance of an object, create disguises to aid the mission or it can hide people in plain sight. She is left-handed and is rarely seen without her broom, as it was from her original role as a cleaner for hell. To stay close to Keima, she tells Mari, Keima`s mother, that she is an illegitimate child of Keima`s father, and ends up living in the Katsuragi household as well as attending the same class in school. Elsie is often made fun of by the other demons because of the poor grades she had in the demon academy. However, after partnering with Keima, they were able to capture 9 escaped spirits within half a year`s time, which earned her the Section Chief`s Award.\nElsie is also a member of Chihiro`s band in which she plays a left handed bass. She has also developed an interest in fire trucks. She literally idolises Keima, often referring to him as \"Kami-sama\" or \"Kami-nii-sama\" in her role as his sister.",
