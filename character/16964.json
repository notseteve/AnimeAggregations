  "description" : "Laura is an assassin, skilled with firearms and other weapons, who is repeatedly sent to assassinate http://anidb.net/ch16960 [Rin] by Apos. Although Rin kills Laura in most of the engagements, Apos resurrects her so that she can attack Rin again. In episode four, she becomes a cyborg, though the extent of her transformation is left open. Episode five reveals that Laura is in possession of an android body designed to resemble Rin and telepathically linked to Apos` torture victim, and she further elaborates in episode six that only her brain remains immortal, apparently as the result of Apos` sadistic manipulations. Rin extracts the Fruit of Time from there and feeds it into Apos at Laura`s own request so that he would feel her memory and pain.",
