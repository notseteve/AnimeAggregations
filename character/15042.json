  "description" : "Arvind Lavie is the assistant chief clerk and self-described \"Number 2\" of the Debris Section who hails from India. He is a divorced father of seven children. He is portrayed as a trickster or prop comedian with a very flexible body. Seemingly obnoxious and opportunistic, he seems to always seek to climb the corporate ladder. However, this is because he pays a substantial amount of child support, and seeks a better life for his many children.\nSource: Wikipedia",
