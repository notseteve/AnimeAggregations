  "description" : "Kanata is amongst the most popular boys in his school, especially among the girls, due to his good looks. Shortly after Miyu arrives at his home, Kanata`s father declares that he wishes to leave on a year long trip to India for enlightenment, thus binding him and Miyu to living together in the same house. Miyu starts attending Kanata`s school and they have difficulty keeping their secret about living together. He finds out from Miyu`s mother that they were both childhood friends and starts to like her more and more as the story progresses (but still teases her to mask it). His mother, a good friend of Miyu`s mother, died while he was young. Kanata`s favorite food is pumpkin, and likes all its variants, from squash to the chips varieties. Luu also calls Kanata \"papa\" because he looks very similar to Luu`s real father.",
