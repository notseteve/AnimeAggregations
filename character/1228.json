  "description" : "Gible is the 4th generation rare Dragon type. Gible once lived in the tropics, but moved into caves to live off geothermal heat. Gible lives in tunnels it constructs inside warm caves. It prefers heat similar to that of a tropical climate. It nests in small, horizontal holes in cave walls. It pounces to catch prey that stray too close. Gible is one of the few Dragon/Ground Pokémon, making it weak to Ice- and Dragon-type moves. It is mostly a physical, speed Pokémon.\nGible Learns 10 Moves by Leveling Up (Last one at Lv.37, Dragon Rush), 36 Moves by TM (4 Are HM), and has 10 Egg Moves.",
