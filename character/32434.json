  "description" : "Maria is the supervising teacher of the http://anidb.net/ch37939 [Neighbors Club]; she is a ten-year old nun. While she`s a child genius she is also very rude and immature, and often uses a variety of expletives when annoyed. She develops a sibling-like relationship with http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka], who regularly makes her packed lunches, and is affectionate with him, much to http://anidb.net/ch32432 [Kobato`s] annoyance. She is also gullible, which http://anidb.net/ch32428 [Yozora] uses to her advantage, and at some point, Kobato uses it to win an argument.\nSource: Wiki",
