  "description" : "In addition to the normal position displacement (disappearing in one position followed by reappearing in another) much like Aoi, the young teleporter Mio can also generate distance-displacement portals that can even ignore physical obstacles as Dr. Sakaki has been forced to endure while in the middle of a fight with her bodyguard Yamada. Mio is unwilling to accept Kaoru as any kind of ruler that could replace her crush Kyousuke and demonstrates this by kidnapping Minamoto to her very run-down hideout. Minamoto guiding her through proper nutrition/hygiene and even giving her a new outfit inspires Mio but does not stop her vendetta against Kaoru. Mio`s downfall is brought about when Minamoto reasons that Mio probably has the same weakness as Akira`s metempsychosis. Sure enough, Minamoto transporting Mio`s genuine lower half out of range causes Mio to recall her clones, one of which has gone maverick. Kaoru`s intercession along with Minamoto`s compassion for her inspires Mio to reflect on her conduct even if her jealousy is not yet resolved.",
