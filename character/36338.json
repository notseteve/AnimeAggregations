  "description" : "Muu is the Second Tsuchikage. His body is covered by intricately wrapped bandages, with only his eyes and nose visible, giving him an overall mummy-like appearance. These features are accentuated by a dark-coloured headband with no distinguishing markings and dark pants. Muu is an extremely calm and collected individual, and unfailingly polite.\nHe is also a skilled sensor type shinobi displaying the ability to sense chakra over a distance of several kilometers. Furthermore, when these detection capabilities are employed in conjunction with his quick reflexes, he can avoid techniques that even other Kage`s find difficult to evade. He has also demonstrated the ability to levitate and fly.\nMuu is capable of becoming perfectly camouflaged with the surrounding environment. His camouflage is so good that he has become renowned as the \"Non-Person\" (Mujin), a title which he gained for seemingly having no form, and no chakra, while the technique was active. It is impossible to detect him by normal means. Muu is one of the few people capable of using a kekkei touta, an advanced and extremely powerful form of kekkei genkai. In particular, he possesses the Dust Release, which allows him to combine the fire, the earth and the wind element to reduce his opponents to nothing more than mere dust, destroying them down to even a molecular level. This Dust Release makes him so powerful that the Allied Shinobi Forces fear him greatly.\nHe also had a great enmity with the Second Mizukage. The two men eventually killed each other in battle.",
