  "description" : "Hannibal Barca is a famous Carthaginian military commander. Now a http://anidb.net/ch86429 [Drifter] and elderly, he is first seen arguing with http://anidb.net/ch81506 [Scipio Africanus] over the latter`s \"plagiarism\" of Cannae at the Battle of Zama. Despite nearly being killed by the http://anidb.net/ch81510 [Black King]`s army, Hannibal still insists that victory is still possible. After being separated from Scipio, Hannibal becomes depressed and senile, but he is still able to articulate battle tactics to his fellow Drifters via indirect means. He acts as http://anidb.net/ch79269 [Nobunaga]`s military advisor since being left in http://anidb.net/ch79268 [Toyohisa]`s group`s care.\nSource: Wikipedia",
