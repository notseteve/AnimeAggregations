  "description" : "Nephrite is the second of the Shiten`ou to appear. Queen Beryl appoints him to continue the energy hunting job following Jadeite being condemned to Eternal Sleep. Nephrite hypothesizes that more energy can be taken by concentrating on a single human than by drawing from a crowd as Jadeite usually.\nEstablishing himself in an abandoned church, he uses intonation with the stars to detect the energy potential of individual people before attacking them when he implants the essence of one of his Youma into a specific person`s object.\nHe, in turn, is mocked by his would-be successor, Zoisite. Nephrite uses one alter ego, Sanjouin Masato, a wealthy businessman and socialite.\nHe is named after the mineral nephrite.",
