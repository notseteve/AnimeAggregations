  "description" : "A scientist aboard Watcher`s Nest and an accomplice to LeBlanc. Her duties include overseeing the Rampart Armours and Integral Systems, repairing Kotoko, monitoring the physical and mental data of the cadets, analysing data for LeBlanc, and keeping watch on their test subject, Misaki. She follows LeBlanc unquestioningly, but not always happily, expressing secret concern and sorrow for Misaki. Even when she breaks schedule to give all four cadets a day off to recover, her concern seems to be primarily for Misaki. It is revealed later in the series that Prim was the product of genetic engineering, and as such she sees Misaki as a kindred spirit.",
