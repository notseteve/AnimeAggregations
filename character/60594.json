  "description" : "Fifth year i class. Age 14, Pisces, blood type A. Stand-in President of the Explosives Committee.\nLong eyelashes and black hair are his defining characteristics. Though his grades are superb and he`s earnest and cool, his spontaneous nature was somewhat revealed when he`d failed to realize that the costs of amazake were included in the Explosives Committee`s appropriation. Since he had to carry tofu in the Sport`s Day relay, he is known as the `Tofu Kid`. Truthfully he hates this nickname, and in the manga at times he denies liking tofu; however, in actuality he is abundant in tofu knowledge and he seems to like tofu cooking. In the anime he will openly declare his love for tofu and treat others to tofu he has prepared himself. He carries freeze-dried tofu around for a mid-afternoon snack. He is the stand-in committee president for the Explosives Committee and rounds up the underclassmen; even though he is Takamaru`s senpai he adds ``san`` to his name since he is older. In the musical his weapon of choice is the suntetsu. In the survival orienteering he was paired in a group with Isuke. His surname comes from Kukuchi in Amagasaki.\nSource: Wiki",
