  "description" : "Doctor (or Peeping Doctor) is a man dressed in a top hat and dinner suit, who apparently has developed his skills at hiding into the ability to become invisible. While most of the time he uses this power for peeping on women, http://anidb.net/ch10263 [Kaoru]`s inukami among them, he also uses it to help Keita during battles against http://anidb.net/ch10272 [Sekidousai]. He has considerable skill in the art of invisibility, as he can sneak past most of Kaoru`s inukami, and was able to get close enough to Sekidousai to steal his book, dodge his attacks and escape. The Peeping Doctor claims that he never returns to any place where he has been spotted and affects gentlemanly airs despite his unpleasant hobby. He apparently forms a team with http://anidb.net/ch10284 [Oyakata] and the http://anidb.net/ch10285 [Kakarichou].",
