  "description" : "Toma is a young commoner boy and the older brother of http://anidb.net/ch91835 [Nico]. He is quite harsh towards his younger brother Nico and hits the younger boy over the head when the two travel together. Also, unlike his brother, Toma exercises caution and worries about dangers when adventuring outside. He seems to hold no belief in mystical creatures like fairies, admonishing his brother when the latter claims to have seen them. Nevertheless, he appears to care for his brother, holding the boy back by his hood when he becomes excited after witnessing a flying monster.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
