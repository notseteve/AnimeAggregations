  "description" : "The defining voice of the Ippo franchise, the ring announcer is with us throughout every liver blow, gazelle punch, and Dempsey roll of every match. His approach to color commentating makes Howard Cosell look like Max Kellerman and is often more enthusiastic and aggressive than the fighters in the ring. He is unrivaled on the mic and unbiased toward the fights, refusing to shy away from controversial criticisms and insisting on calling it how he sees it. Many life lessons can be learned from this great man, whose mysterious past, or even name may never be revealed.",
