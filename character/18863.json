  "description" : "An old woman who spends the majority of her time going after discounts and sale events. To the annoyance of every Traffic Division officer in the Bokuto Precinct, she does so relentlessly and is perfectly willing to commit any traffic violation in order to get to the sales location faster, having proven herself just as aggressive on the road as Natsumi or Nakajima (except that she does it all the time) and counting on the reflexes of people or vehicles she was about to collide with rather than her skills in operating a scooter to avoid accidents. However, another situation would intervene (such as repeating motorcycle thefts or bomb threats against a department store) whenever there`s an attempt to apprehend her, allowing her to go off the hook. Her name was never revealed.\nFor transportation she uses a motor scooter (with a 50cc engine, hence her nickname), which tends to be overloaded with groceries and other merchandises that she purchased during discount events.",
