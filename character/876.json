  "description" : "Torchic is the Fire-type starting Pokémon in Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, and Pokémon Emerald. It is a small, clumsy bird, covered by a fluffy coat of down. Before Torchic`s legs develop fully, it stays with their Pokémon trainer, following behind with unsteady, hopping steps while it learns to walk properly. It attacks by spitting 1,800 degree fire formed in a special pouch in its stomach. This pouch constantly heats its body, allowing it to give \"warm hugs.\" It dislikes darkness due to not being able to see its surroundings.\nIn the anime, May choses a playful Torchic as her starter Pokémon because she considers it to be cute. She often uses it in battles, but avoids using it in Pokémon Contests until it evolves.",
