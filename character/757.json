  "description" : "Ansbach was an aide to Imperial Duke http://anidb.net/ch261 [Otto von Braunschweig], and was present at the Braunschweig estate during Marquis http://anidb.net/ch265 [Wilhelm von Klopstock]`s unsuccessful assassination attempt on Kaiser http://anidb.net/ch206 [Friedrich IV].\nAnsbach sided with the nobles during the Imperial Civil War and served in the http://anidb.net/ch6230 [Lippstadt League]. He defended his lord when http://anidb.net/ch201 [Ovlesser] advanced upon Braunschweig and killed Ovlesser with his pistol. When http://anidb.net/ch254 [Braunschweig`s nephew] was killed in a rebellion on Westerland, Ansbach disagreed strongly with Braunschweig`s decision to use nuclear weapons upon the planet and instead advocated for punishing only the ringleaders of the rebellion. He was overruled and imprisoned for voicing an apparent defeatist opinion.\nHe escaped from his imprisonment when Braunschweig had lost most of his support and was in imminent danger of capture. He disabused his lord of the possibility of alliance with http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] or escape, and coerced his lord to commit suicide. Ansbach offered Reinhard von Lohengramm the body of Duke Braunschweig in an attempt to assassinate Lohengramm. His attempt failed but he succeeded in killing http://anidb.net/ch187 [Siegfried Kircheis]. He committed suicide with a poison capsule that he had secreted in a tooth. Despite being disillusioned, Ansbach had remained loyal to Braunschweig and his final words were of apology to his lord.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
