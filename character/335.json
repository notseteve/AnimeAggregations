  "description" : "Slowpoke is a dual-type Water/Psychic Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\nIt evolves into Slowbro starting at level 37 or Slowking when traded holding a King`s Rock.\nIn Galar, Slowpoke has a pure Psychic-type regional form, introduced in Pokémon Sword and Shield`s 1.1.0 patch. It will evolve into Galarian Slowbro using an item found on the Isle of Armor or Galarian Slowking using an item found in the Crown Tundra.\nSlowpoke is a pink Pokémon that resembles a cross between a salamander and a hippopotamus. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. In Alola, its tail is often dried and used in home cooked stews.\nSlowpoke has notoriously dim intellect, and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water`s edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke`s yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas.\nIn Galar, Slowpoke gains yellow markings on its forehead and tail.",
