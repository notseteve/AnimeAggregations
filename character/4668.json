  "description" : "A 13-year old foreign transfer student. She is also a boarder at the Hinata Inn, in room 301.\nShe is from the fictional kingdom of Molmol, supposedly located near the International Date Line, and is the princess of said country. The dot on her forehead seems to have something to do with the 3-eyed symbol of Molmol, though it resembles (indeed, is almost identical to) a bindi dot. She is often dressed in nothing else except her heavily altered school uniform in almost every episode, or some otherwise scant costume. To top her personality, she is above all extremely hyperactive, usually hugging (or, in Keitarou`s case, kicking) someone, trying to eat something, especially bananas and/or Tama-chan, or inventing some potentially dangerous new device.",
