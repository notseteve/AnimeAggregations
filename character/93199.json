  "description" : "Tachibana Akira is a young high-school student, with a sharp, piercing expression, that make many people, slightly wary of her. She used to be part of the track and field team, before a leg injury forced her to give up running. Having fallen into a depression, she met http://anidb.net/ch93201 [Masami] who acted in a kind and friendly manner, offering her a free coffee when she took shelter at the restaurant in the rain. This act of kindness, began her infatuation with him. Despite her cold, and inapproachable demeanor, she is actually rather timid and shy, especially, when it comes to Masami.\nSource: Wikipedia",
