  "description" : "Lieutenant General Grumman is http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Roy Mustang]`s commanding officer and mentor at East City headquarters. He plays chess with Roy Mustang when the transfer to central has came for Roy, Roy then bests the Lieutenant General in a game of chess to which the General gives him the board (And pieces) as a farewell gift.\nHe is an old man that takes a lighthearted approach to his command. When Roy Mustang transfers from Eastern Headquarters to Central, Grumman authorizes the transfer of Mustang`s subordinates, including his granddaughter http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Riza Hawkeye] (though it is unknown if she is aware of this relationship). After the Homunculi strip Mustang of his subordinates, he calls for Grumman`s aid. Grumman, not under the Homunculi`s surveillance, acts on Mustang`s behalf in intelligence gathering and communication, going as far as dressing up like an old woman to not be spotted in Central. Though a willing and powerful ally, he is reluctant to openly work against the military; as being branded a traitor would make it difficult to become the next leader of Amestris.\nIt is implied in a joke that Grumman doesn`t do anything in the East City Headquaters when he says to Roy: \"Now that your transfer to central has become final, I may have to start doing things around here again.\", although this may just be an inside joke between the two. Grumman makes a brief cameo in Conqueror of Shamballa. He is implied to have replaced http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley] as the leader of Amestris.",
