  "description" : "Ousawa Akatsuki is the main protagonist of the anime. After having defeated the Demon King Maou Galious in the world of Alayzard, he is hailed as the True Hero. The Demon King entrusted to him his daughter Miu, whom he secretly brought to Earth. Given his reckless and mischievous behaviour, he was also known as the \"Rogue Hero\".\nOn Earth, he is pressed, along with Miu (posing as his long-lost younger sister) into Babel School, along with all other people who have returned from sojourns to other worlds. As a student, he is generally laid back and kind-hearted by nature, though he will ruthlessly respond to aggression against himself or the people he cares about. He also has a mischievous side, and is known to do perverted things such as stealing girls` underwear from under their clothes.\nIn battle he has considerable physical strength, speed, and endurance, as befits a hero. Though he lacks the ability to use magic, he has a mysterious power capable of controlling the Chi energy within himself, people around him, and the environment. This power is presumably the origin of his great physical prowess. He is initially unable to use an AD, but later on after getting several more AD bands from other students he manages to materialize an oversized black sword inscribed with runes called LÃ¦vateinn.",
