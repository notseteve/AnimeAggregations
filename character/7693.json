  "description" : "Akira Fudou lost his birth parents at a young age to an accident while exploring the Himalayas, killing his mother and father. He was then taken in to live in the care of close family friends. He has always been timid, shy, with very little courage and was often bullied before becoming into contact with the `Demon Lord of Battles`, Amon.
