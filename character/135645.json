  "description" : "Otsutsuki Isshiki was a member of the Otsutsuki clan`s main family who originally came to Earth with Kaguya to plant a God Tree and harvest its chakra fruit. He was betrayed by Kaguya, who left him for dead, and took over the body of a novice monk named Jigen, who he also branded with a Kāma. Centuries later, he became the leader of Kara as Jigen in order to continue to carry out his original plan, as well as secure a new, better vessel in Kawaki. He was forced to ressurrect in Jigen`s body, and died without being able to apply a new Kāma, leading to his soul being extinguished, but not before entrusting his failed vessel and loyal follower Code with carrying on the Otsutsuki Will.",
