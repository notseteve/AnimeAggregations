  "description" : "Trip`s Vanillite was first seen battling a wild Palpitoad. It used Ice Beam on its feet so it couldn`t escape. Trip tried to catch it with a monster ball, but Ash got hit by it instead.\nJust before Ash and Trip`s three-on-three battle, Iris encountered Trip`s Vanillite. She instantly tried to avoid it and started to shiver. She explained that since Dragon types have a disadvantage against Ice types, she dislike the cold that Ice Pokémon create. Trip tried to confront her about her dislike of Ice Pokémon by telling her that Dragon Pokémon are also strong against Dragon Pokémon but she only reluctantly apologized to Trip`s Vanillite and her mind wasn`t truly changed.\nThree-on-Three Battle Against Ash`s Tepig\nAsh`s Tepig was sent out and Trip`s Vanillite was sent out to battle it. Trip`s Vanillite had a major disadvantage against a Fire type like Ash`s Tepig but Trip had intentionally paired them up because he wanted to win against Ash by using his nonsensical battling style. Trip`s Vanillite proved to have high defense as it was able to endure a direct Ember attack. It then countered with while Ash`s Tepig used Flame Charge but they both ended up knocking each other out leaving the battle at a draw.",
