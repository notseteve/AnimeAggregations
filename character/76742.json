  "description" : "Hitotsubashi NobuNobu is the 15th shogun and the head of the Hitotsubashi Faction.\nHe is the son of Hitotsubashi Narinari, part of one of the three branches of the Tokugawa Family. The family had fallen from grace at the end of the Joui Wars when a relative of his lost a battle against the Joui. His father and their retainers were forced to climb back into the government while dodging potential assassination attempts from the leader of the Tokugawa Faction, http://anidb.net/ch53228 [Tokugawa Sadasada]. The shrewd Narinari groomed Nobunobu from birth to become the next Shogun. And ever since, Nobunobu and his faction gathered allies within and outside the government to wait for the chance to usurp Sadasada`s groomed successor, http://anidb.net/ch11860 [Tokugawa Shigeshige], of his position of Shogun.\nSource: Gintama Wiki, edited.",
