  "description" : "The main protagonist of Accel World. Also known as Haru by his close friends, he is a short and fat boy with low self-esteem until he meets Kuroyukihime. Although he is generally smart and careful when it comes to everyday life, Haru tends to get reckless while protecting Kuroyukihime. He views her as a mentor, friend, and lover simultaneously, which has given him the utmost respect and loyalty toward her and her army. His non-accelerated avatar is a small pink pig that was originally forced on him by his bully, only keeping it because Kuroyukihime finds it \"cute.\" While in Akibahara, Blood Leopard gives him a different avatar to fit in, taking the form of a small pink lizard.\nSource: Wiki",
