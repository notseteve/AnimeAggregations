  "description" : "Rattata, known as the Mouse Pokémon, are a basic Pokémon species found very commonly in the wild in the Kanto and Johto regions of the Pokémon world. Rattata are among the earliest Pokémon that can be caught by players, so much so that it is said that the presence of one Rattata indicates the presence of more than forty Rattata in the area. They make their nests almost anywhere and as extreme omnivores eat anything they can scavenge. A Rattata`s fangs grow continuously throughout its lifespan, so it whittles them down to a comfortable size by gnawing on hard objects.",
