  "description" : "With a monstrous face and a huge body, Misao is feared by anyone who sees his face or knows his name (with the exception of his childhood friend and neighbor, http://anidb.net/ch6567 [Misaki Yamamoto]). As expected, he is a capable fighter with plenty of enemies. However, he is also unexpectedly shy; being unable to convey his feelings through words, he writes his confession on a note, and he is unable to bring himself to even say http://anidb.net/ch6556 [Ayumi]`s name. He fell for Ayumi when he saw her picture while looking through http://anidb.net/ch6561 [his brother]`s class photos. After Ayumi made him realize that he scares her, he decided to watch over her at a distance.",
