  "description" : "Tsuji Shinnosuke is an ambitious rival of Kisara, often getting into arguments about who was stronger. He has a rougher fighting style and fewer techniques than Ken`ichi but greater experience. He had hoped to one day lead a gang stronger than Ragnarok and initially had hordes of men as followers, but after he was beaten by an unintentional sneak attack by Ken`ichi, he loses all but two of them. He gains respect for Ken`ichi, informs him of Takeda`s impending punishment at the hands of Ragnarok, and warns him of Hermit.\nFollowing his defeat by Kenichi, he goes into the mountains to train. He finds a master and is later able to obtain a victory - of sorts - over Ken`ichi before the D of D tournament. He refuses a rematch, saying that he`s going to hold onto the victory for the rest of his life and never fight Ken`ichi again. His current whereabouts are unknown, though most likely he has returned to the mountains to continue his training with his master.",
