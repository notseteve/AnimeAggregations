It was able to quickly defeat it by rendered it completely immobile with Sleep Powder and then finish it off with an Energy Ball.\nBeing Clembot`s first battle since its memory wipe, Alba`s Vivillon battle against Clemont`s Magnemite was pretty easy. Clemont reminded Clembot not to get agitated and to watch the opponent closely. Clembot vowed not to loose this time. It sent out Clemont`s Magneton and with a quick combination of Rain Dance and Thunder, it one hit KO`d Alba`s Vivillon.",
