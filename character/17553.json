  "description" : "Amakusa Shino is introduced in the story as a second-year student and the student council president. She is serious and diligent, excels in academics, and is very popular among the student body. However, she is almost always thinking of perverted things. She suggests that one of her original reasons she shows interest in Takatoshi is so she can observe him in health and physical education classes. She fears heights and insects, and her rather flat chest makes her feel self-conscious, especially when comparing herself to Aria. She is occasionally shown doing couple-like activities with Takatoshi such as walking with him, sharing an umbrella or clearing his earwax, but gets embarrassed whenever Takatoshi says something to her that could be interpreted as romantic. According to her childhood friend Amano Misaki, Shino was student council president at her previous school as well.\nSource: Wiki",
