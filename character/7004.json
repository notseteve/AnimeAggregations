  "description" : "President of the http://anidb.net/ch9171 [Student Council] and Ootori`s resident playboy, Touga is an arrogant and handsome young man whose desire to be powerful drives him to cruel and unscrupulous deeds. He is the only regular Council Member who deliberately involves himself in http://anidb.net/ch8697 [Akio]`s plans. Despite his talent and intelligence, Touga eventually realizes that he`s nowhere near as influential as Akio or strong as http://anidb.net/ch6847 [Utena], and this causes him to change his ways as he tries to discover a new method to gain power. His Duelling Rose is red.\nAlthough he says that he wishes to be noble, he has little empathy towards anyone, and his powers of manipulation are second only to Akio. He also shares his playboy attitude and has many female conquests. He is a childhood friend of Saionji, although their relationship took a turn for the worse at a point in their childhood that is the centrepiece of their respective personal journeys.\nToward the end of the series, however, Touga`s fa√ßade of chivalry is replaced with an apparently truer concern for Utena, to the extent that he very subtly attempts to substitute his head for hers on Akio`s chopping block. Arguably, this is also an example of Touga`s inability to see Utena as who she really is, rather than in a stereotypical feminine role.",
