  "description" : "Yasopp is the sharpshooter of the Red-Haired Pirates, and the father of Usopp and husband of Banchina. He shares many personality traits with his son, including being able to encourage the rest of his crew to join in with his fun. He is very proud of his son Usopp, to the point where he would often talk over and over again about his son to Luffy (which led Luffy to recognize Usopp on sight from Yasopp`s stories alone). During his time in Luffy`s village Yasopp felt close to Luffy, who was the same age as Usopp, because he was separated from his son Usopp. Yasopp is portrayed as a virtually unequaled sharpshooter, capable of shooting the antennas off an ant at 100 feet without harming the rest of it. Being a sniper, Yasopp carries guns around with him almost all the time. He is mostly seen carrying a musket, likely from personal preference.",
