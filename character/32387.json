  "description" : "Alexandria is Victor`s wife. Her body was paralyzed after Victor went lost control, a century before the start of the series, and she moved her own brain into a container in the Newton`s Apple All Girls Academy. She lives inside her daughter Victoria`s Buso Renkin, Underground Searchlight, where she continually clones her own brain to increase her mental abilities and to complete Kakugane II. However, after a century in this state, her cells begin to die, and she fades away before the confrontation between Victor and Kazuki. Even 100 years after what Victor did to her, she still loves him and relays her daughter one final message before disappearing. While still in her human form, she specialized in making meat pies.",
