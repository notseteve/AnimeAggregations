  "description" : "He is the President of the Computer Research Society (or Computer Society), which shares a room adjacent to the SOS Brigade. The President is never given a name other than \"Computer Society President\" or variations upon that term (all that is known of his name is the first syllable: \"ya\"). He and his club have had the misfortune of being targeted by Haruhi`s blackmail, being forced to give away their best computer and wire the Brigade`s clubroom for an internet connection. He hasn`t yet forgiven this, and checks the SOS Brigade website to see if they are putting the computer to use (which they haven`t), making him the primary cause of their hit counter`s steady rise.",
