  "description" : "The Dai-Gunkai, rivalling the Dai-Gunzan in terms of sheer bulk and apparently much lengthier, is an aquatic serpentine Gunmen fortress, which served as Adiane`s flagship. Little is known about its abilities, other than its obvious aptitude for sea travel. While it seems to only be able to travel in a body of water, the Dai-Gunkai`s first appearance was marked by a sudden deluge over the battlefield (suggesting that it may have the ability to either divert or even create large volumes of water).\nThe only appearance of the Dai-Gunkai in combat was in episode 12, when it ambushed the Dai-Gurren, while it was crossing the ocean on its march to the Helix Empire`s capital. Its main weaponry consisted of torpedoes guided by dolphin Beastmen and two massive pincers, which it used on its attempt to drag the Dai-Gurren to the bottom of the ocean. After bringing the Dai-Gurren back to the surface, the Gurren-Lagann obliterated the Dai-Gunkai completely, but Viral, who was commanding the ship at that time, managed to survive.",
