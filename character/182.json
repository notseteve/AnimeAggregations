  "description" : "Venonat is a fairly common, dark purple, gnat-like Pok√©mon that can be found in various areas in Kanto and Johto. Venonat, though it is based on a bug, is covered in thin, stiff fur, which is said to be used for protection. It has two concentrated clusters of microscopic, red eyes. They can be used to shoot powerful beams, and also function as radar, which enables Venonat to be active at night and to easily capture its preferred prey of small, nocturnal insects. Venonat prefers the dark, inhabiting the hollows of trees and other shadowed areas, yet is attracted to bright lights.",
