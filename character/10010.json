Her grandfather runs Bai Lan (White Lotus) and comes from a very powerful Chinese family. Sei was born and raised as a traditional Chinese girl and was trained in various ways of her clan/syndicate. After her grandfather stepped down as leader of the clan, their current clan members made a partnership with RAPT to preserve their clan. However, such actions not only disgusted Sei, she was also forced to do many things for RAPT in Bai Lan`s name. She eventually rebelled against her own organization under the advice of her grandfather.",
