  "description" : "Naomoto intends to film the \"ideal movie\" with Akira and Saki as the main characters, and to ultimately kill them in such a way that has never before been seen in film. For that reason, he causes them a lot of problems, especially for Saki, because he figures that the prince will come to save `the damsel in distress`. His ill-conceived plot is foiled thanks to Shiratori`s intervention. Amusingly, his Juiz seems be uncooperative and usually ridicules his requests.",
