  "description" : "Kihel Heim is the oldest daughter of the Heim family. Though Kihel is a wealthy heiress, she chooses to look for work and gain real-world experience rather than attend university. She sticks close to Guin Lineford during Dianna Counter`s first attack and uses the opportunity to become his assistant. Her new position brings her to the attention of the leaders of the Moonrace.\nKihel bears a striking resemblance to Dianna Soreil, which allows her to become the Queen`s double. She takes Dianna`s place at the Queen`s behest and, due to events beyond their control, ends up having to impersonate Dianna and lead the Dianna Counter on a long-term basis. The two go on to switch names and roles several times. Kihel and Dianna share many qualities beyond appearance and their ideals are so aligned that for a time they consider themselves a single person. Even so, Kihel has much more energy than Dianna, and does not share Dianna`s longing for an ordinary life. She is very good at masking her insecurity over whether or not she can live up to Dianna`s example.",
