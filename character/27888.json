  "description" : "Takeshima Tsutako is http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi]`s friend and avid photographer, called the \"ace\" of the Photography Club and helps out sometimes for the school`s newspaper. Never without her camera, she is always looking to capture the latest gossip about the Yamayurikai, and swears she can never be tied down to having a s≈ìur of her own. She is sharp and constantly on the standby for the best shot; and with a quick brain and tongue to match, she often provides the emotional support and advice for Yumi. She sometimes unexpectedly defuses a few tensions within the Yamayurikai with her camera.",
