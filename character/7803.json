  "description" : "Nausicaa is a charismatic young princess of the peaceful Valley of the Wind. Although a skillful fighter, she is humane and peace-loving. She has an unusual gift for communicating with the giant insects (particularly with the Ohmu who are the most intelligent creatures in the Sea of Decay). She is also noted for her empathy toward animals, humans, and other beings. An intelligent girl, and inspired by the mentor figure http://anidb.net/ch7804 [Yupa], a wandering samurai type possessed of great wisdom, Nausicaa frequently explores the Sea of Decay and conducts scientific experiments in an attempt to define the true nature and origins of the toxic world in which she lives. Her explorations are facilitated by her skill at \"windriding\"; flying with an advanced jet assisted glider craft called Mahve.\nSource: Wikipedia",
