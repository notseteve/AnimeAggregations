  "description" : "Ralts is a basic Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. Its red eyes are often obscured by its green \"hair\", and its body is somewhat like a white dress. It very rarely appears before humans, and when it does, the person`s emotions are a key factor in deciding whether it will come closer or run away. Its ability to sense emotions, or empathy, is linked to the horns on its head, and Ralts tends to mirror the emotions of its trainer. Its method of getting around is hopping on its legs or using its psychic abilities to teleport to its desired location.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Max befriends a Ralts, and promised to take it on adventures with him once he becomes old enough to be a Pokémon Trainer.",
