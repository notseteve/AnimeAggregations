  "description" : "Expelled, staying home sick, a printing mistake on the class roll! The girls of 2-A can think of a thousand reasons why none of them have met Aizaka Sayo at school. But, Sayo`s been there all along! and longer! A ghost stuck for 60 years at Mahora after an accidental demise, Sayo is a melancholy observer of the crazy goings on in 2-A. Life is a hazy memory, and until Kazumi looks into it, Sayo doesn`t recall her death. With a little help from the class reporter, the little spirit might finally be able to participate in some of the fun she has had to witness from the sidelines! and from the other side!",
