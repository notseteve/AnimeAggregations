  "description" : "He is a Gold Saint, guardian of the temple of Aquarius, and also Cygnus Hyoga and Kraken Isaac`s master in manga. In the anime, he was the master of the Crystal Saint, who was Hyoga and Isaac`s master. Camus is a cold looking Saint, since he believes the Gold Saint, as the strongest among Athena`s guards, should never show exasperation or it would draw the people into despair. In the manga, he reveals that he actually knew that the Pope wasn`t working under Athena`s will, but he still kept working under his orders to fulfill his role as the Aquarius Gold Saint. Even so, he was glad to see his pupil Hyoga fighting for the real Athena. Since Milo fought Hyoga, he mentioned Camus in a way that led the fans to believe they were close friends. Apparently, this was made official since the animation of the Hades saga included more personal interaction between them than the manga, and they are depicted as friends in Saint Seiya Episode G. He is named after Albert Camus.",
