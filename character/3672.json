  "description" : "Miyu is an independent, headstrong, and very kind classmate of Ran and one of her closest friends. She once was the leader of a street gang called the \"Resistance\", often wreaking mayhem and irritation during middle school and had a rough-mannered and threatening personality that Ran despised. One day, Yamato (by then a rookie cop) saved her from a tough situation, and his dedication to helping with Miyu`s problems made her fall in love with him. Because of that, she left the life of crime and became a much more polite girl after Yamato told her his wish for her to be good and eventually became great friends with Ran.",
