  "description" : "Toucannon is a dual-type Normal/Flying Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Trumbeak starting at level 28. It is the final form of Pikipek.\nToucannon is an avian Pokémon with black feathers and a prominent beak similar to a toucan`s. The upper part of the beak has a black tip with three red bands gradually lightening in color toward the yellow base. The mandible is smaller and solid red. Around the base of the beak is a thin black band with two extensions into the upper jaw similar to nostrils. The reds bands on the beaks can change color and move from the tip to the base. There are gases inside the beak, which can ignite and launch seeds with enough force to shatter boulders. Additionally, its temperature can exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit and cause severe burns on contact. It can use this beak to warm up eggs, as shown in the anime.\nToucannon has dark blue eyes, light blue eyelids, and jagged, gray eyebrows. There is a white marking covering its chin and chest, and a half-circle, yellow marking on each cheek. It has a long tail with a spiky ruff of red feathers around the base, and spindly blue legs. Each foot has two forward facing toes with black talons and two rear-facing toes with no visible claws.",
