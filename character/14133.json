  "description" : "Rimururu is a recurring character in the Samurai Spirits series. She made her first appearance in the series as a background character in Nakoruru`s stage during Samurai Spirits II. Her prototype design in this game was formerly a scrapped concept for one of the heroines from another SNK game, Robo Army.\nShe is the younger sister of Nakoruru, and lives in an Ainu village on Hokkaido. She greatly admires her older sister, and like her, strives to protect nature. Rimururu has also been referred to as a priestess of the Ainu religion. In her ending to Samurai Spirits V, it is revealed to players that Nakoruru adopts her at a young age. Although she is still training and not as adept as her sister at fighting, she repels evil from the forest for her elder sister. When her sister departs, Rimururu often follows her in hopes of offering assistance. Nakoruru originally forbids her younger sister`s attempts to be a priestess but relents once she recognizes Rimururu`s resolve.",
