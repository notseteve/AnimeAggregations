  "description" : "Ho-Oh is a legendary Pokémon that first appears in Pokémon Gold and Silver, appearing on Gold`s boxart. Long ago in Ecruteak City, there were two towers, the Brass Tower and Tin Tower being the roost of Lugia and Ho-Oh, respectively. When the Brass Tower burned down, both Pokémon fled, never to be seen again. Three Pokémon became trapped in the flames of the Brass Tower and perished. Ho-Oh returned to the Burned Tower and resurrected the three Pokémon, who were renamed Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. It has an unknown gender. On Gold, it is Lv40 when caught while it is Lv70 when caught in Silver. It is better to have the lower version as the move tutor does not exist in Gold/Silver.\nIt is called the Rainbow Pokémon due to its various associations with rainbows. Its feathers constantly change through the rainbow`s spectrum of colors as light hits them from different angles. These leave a rainbow trail as it flies continuously through the world`s skies, though it is said to live at the foot of a rainbow. It is said to appear before pure-hearted trainers as the representative of the bonds between humans and Pokémon, and bring happiness to all that see it. This is expanded upon in the anime, where it is said to appear before a hero. Ash Ketchum sees Ho-Oh various times throughout his journey, the first time being before Gold and Silver were even announced. It remained a mystery until it was revealed in Pokémon Gold.",
