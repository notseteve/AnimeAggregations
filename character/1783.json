  "description" : "An immortal alchemist who is seeking the recipe of the immortality elixir. The first among the alchemists on the Advena Avis to gain immortality, he went on a killing spree soon after, \"eating\" many fellow alchemists, including Maiza`s brother, thereby obtaining part of the elixir`s recipe. Using this incomplete formula, Szilard developed a potion that created \"quasi-immortals\" capable of healing from any wound, but still susceptible to ageing and being \"eaten\" by full Immortals. He created Ennis as a homunculus. Despite having the body of an old man, Szilard is exceptionally fast and strong, capable of defeating most opponents in physical combat. By the 1930s, Szilard has tracked down and \"eaten\"` eighteen of the original Advena Avis immortals.",
