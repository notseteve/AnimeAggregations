  "description" : "Muk is a living manifestation of sludge and waste. Muk thrives in toxic waste and garbage. It inhabits any polluted area; including abandoned factories, garbage dumps and sewers. It is said that its smell is comparable to that of reeking kitchen garbage, especially during hot summers. Muk itself is also a source of pollution. As Muk slides across the ground, it leaves behind a trail of highly poisonous sludge. Muk and Grimer are known for traveling into water and polluting it and killing plants with their sludge. Muk could be considered antagonistic of Suicune, a Pokémon with the ability to purify dirty or polluted water. It can also be considered antagonistic of Celebi, which can bring dead plants back to life.\nIn the anime, Ash and friends encounter a horde of Grimer, which is led by a Muk. After a group of Magnemits and Magnetons save them, Ash captures the Muk. When Ash first caught Muk, its smell was able to escape the Poké Ball, much to everyone`s displeasure. For this reason, Muk was given to Professor Oak. A running gag in the series involves Muk and his overly affectionate personality. He constantly expressing gratitude towards Professor Oak by hugging him, and in the process smothering him with its gooey body, he also started to do this with Professor Birch.",
