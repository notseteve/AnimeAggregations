  "description" : "Torterra is the final evolution of the Turtwig evolutionary line. Despite their great size, these Pokémon are peaceful in nature and enjoy being with others of their own kind, preferring to bask in sunlight as they do not like to fight. When immobile, they look as if they are part of the ground upon which they rest, not as though they were a sleeping Pokémon. Because of this appearance, there are occasions when small Pokémon will gather and build nests on the shell of a stationary Torterra. When Torterra do move, they often move in herds in search of water. Paul`s, (Ash`s Sinnoh rival`s), original starter Pokémon was a Turtwig that evolved into a Torterra.",
