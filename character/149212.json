  "description" : "The homeroom teacher of Class 5-3 at Domori Elementary School, and the only psychic teacher in Japan. Known for his bright and kind personality, he is affectionately called \"Nube\" by his students, though he also has a clumsy side. His love for his students is unparalleled, and he fearlessly confronts any evil spirit or Yokai that threatens them, even at the risk of his own safety. He uses sutras to help spirits pass peacefully, and when necessary, he unleashes the power of his sealed Demon`s Hand to fight.\nSource: Official page",
