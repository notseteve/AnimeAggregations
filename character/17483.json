  "description" : "Sea of Violence (Boryoku no Umi) is a Shinigami, a member of a race of powerful `death gods/spirits` which, in the inukami setting, behave in a manner often hinting of insanity. A shinigami can do just about anything and will do anything - on a twisted whim. They delight in sowing death and destruction, with Sea of Violence being no exception. Sea of Violence first appears as the nemesis of the Shindou family, whose last member`s guardian contracts http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita] and http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko] to protect her. During his battle with Keita, he reveals that he has often granted the wishes of humans for the same price; by contract, he is allowed to murder the family members as they reach adulthood, one by one, until the whole family is dead. In the case of the Shindou family, Sea of Violence delighted in fighting any protectors they contracted with their own favored style of combat - and winning, killing all those who would not surrender. In addition to wearing a black shinigami robe, which deflects most ranged attacks, Sea of Violence is skilled in a vast array of martial arts and possesses powers of evil magic. Some of his favorite tricks are to awaken a person`s deepest fears to paralyze them, or to evoke madness and terror by uttering a deafening shriek. In the end, it turns out a shinigami is not a match for an angered kitsune, however.",
