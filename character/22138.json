  "description" : "Sai is another friend of Kira Yamato from Heliopolis. When the colony is raided by ZAFT, he ends up with his friends on the Archangel. Sai is put in charge of enemy detection and electronic warfare identification on the CIC of the Archangel. Initially, Sai was in a relationship with Flay Allster but she breaks it off in favor of Kira, which enrages Sai to the point where he tries to move the Strike. Despite his humiliation, Sai does not try to win back Flay and comes to accept that she is with Kira, who is later reported MIA. With Kira gone, Flay attempts to restart her relationship with Sai, denying she ever felt any emotions for Kira but Sai refuses to believe her. Later, Flay is transferred from the Archangel before Operation Spit Break while Sai and the rest of the crew defect to Orb after they are saved by Kira in the stolen ZGMF-X10A Freedom. Sai makes peace with Kira, and the two of them remain on good terms for the remainder of their enlistment together. Sai continues to serve at his post on the Archangel throughout the rest of the war. During that time, he realizes Flay still cares for him in some respects when she calls his name specifically while trying to communicate with the Archangel, and he is deeply saddened when Flay dies at the hands of Rau Le Creuset. A short OVA set after the series shows him going back to a civilian life, one that apparently involves computers. He still keeps pictures of himself with Flay, despite their tumultuous history, and seems content with this new life.",
