  "description" : "Mountain Zaki was a violent and presumptuous lowlife. He was kicked out six schools before joining the newly founded Roshigumi. One day, while causing ruckus and being on the verge of being kicked out once more, he met up with a fellow Roshigumi (Kondou Isao) who showed him a better way, thus reforming him into well-behaving Yamazaki.\nHis name is a pun, since \"mountain\" in kanji is written 山 (yama), but マウンテン (mountain) in katakana.",
