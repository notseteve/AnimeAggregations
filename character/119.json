  "description" : "Alexander Volk Zangiev, the World Amateur Champion, is a handsome boxer from Russia who excels at outboxing and taking points, but adopts a vicious infighting style when he moves to Japan (Ippo notices how depressed he looks after this happens). Raised by a single mother in a small town near to St. Petersburg, Volg originally takes up boxing in order to provide medical assistance for his seriously ill mom (who coincidentally looks a lot like Hiroko Makunouchi, but with longer and reddish hair). Besides his incredible outboxing technique, Volg`s greatest weapon is a vertical combination called \"White Fang\" (a short, quick left uppercut, followed by an incredibly fast and powerful chopping right). His personality is very humble and polite, though he`s a very good boxer, Volg admits that he doesn`t really like boxing as it hurts other people but only does it so he can help his ill mother back home but finally comes to realize he has passion for boxing.",
