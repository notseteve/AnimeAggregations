  "description" : "Nidoking are a fully grown and developed species of male possum-like Pokémon and the final stage in the male Nidoran evolutionary line. Its horn is hard enough to pierce a diamond and contains secreted venom, making it a powerful stabbing tool upon prey and Pokémon battle opponents. Nidoking have immense upper-body strength, being able to snap a telephone pole like it were a twig. It uses its tail to smash down its target, then constrict it to break its bones. Its thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.\nAs several Pokémon seem to have been designed to resemble other aspects of Japanese pop culture and mythology, it is interesting to note that Nidoking bears a resemblance to Baragon, a monster that has appeared in the Godzilla movie series.\nIn the main Pokémon game series, a Nidoking can only be acquired when a Moon Stone item is applied to a Nidorino so that the creature is evolved into a Nidoking. They are the masculine equivalent to Nidoqueen. Also, they are more primal, fighting other Nidoking for such matters as territory or food. (Or a Nidoqueen, in mating season.)",
