  "description" : "An \"advisor robot\" that is big enough to ride on Ramnes` shoulder. Green and elastic. He was an advisor robot to the first hero, Ramnes, but fell asleep to protect the world far away. He gives Ramune, who has come from another world, various advice about the world of Harahara World and battles. His personality is more hot-blooded than Ramune, and he has been in a passionate relationship with a lover named Ure P for over 5,000 years. The guardian knight appears by inserting a coin called \"metal coin\" with its name written and the profile of the head carved into the hole in the head of Tama Q and throwing an egg-shaped capsule that comes out of the mouth.\nIn \"DX\", he was married to Ure P and was busy raising children. Although he was a companion of the first-generation Ramness and the previous heroes, unlike characters with similar settings in later works, he does not lament when comparing the current generation and the current Ramnes. According to the novel version, it is said that most of the original Ramnes have been forgotten due to the so-called senile senility. Therefore, until he saw the recorded video in the sacred land of Ramnecca, he had forgotten the faces of the first-generation heroes and the three first generation holy sisters and did not even realize that Da Cider and Lesca were descendants of the first-generation Da Cider and the first generation caf√© au lait princess.",
