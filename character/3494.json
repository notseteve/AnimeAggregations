  "description" : "Dr. Franken Stein was the most powerful meister to ever graduate from Shibusen. He is such a strong fighter that he could take down Black Star while still being seated in his chair. Stein is based on the central characters from Mary Shelley`s novel Frankenstein, an amalgamation of the mad scientist and Frankenstein`s monster itself. He has a bolt going through his head (which he turns to focus his mind) and stitches all over his body and clothes.",
