  "description" : "A hotheaded 17-year-old high school student, and the protagonist of DearS. Takeya is unused to change, which makes his acceptance of the mysterious alien girl Ren all the more difficult. But beneath his constant mask of indifference, he has a kind heart. Takeya tends to jump into things headfirst, and waste more time panicking about a problem than solving it. He also seems to lose his temper more often than he should because of stress from low grade levels and keeping track of Ren, and as a result, has few close friends. He dislikes the idea of having a slave, though in the end, he does realize that he loves Ren.",
