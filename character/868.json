  "description" : "While the white Mokona left to travel the worlds with the Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle group, the black Mokona stayed behind to act as a liaison between the Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle group and Yuuko. Mokona likes to be around Yuuko, drink with her and eat the meals that Watanuki has made, and mostly chirps in with Maru and Moro. Yuuko has mentioned that the Mokonas were created a very long time ago by herself and Clow Reed, in preparation for a future event - the arrival and subsequent journey of the Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle group - as well as to stop Fei Wong Reed`s plans and save \"two futures\".",
