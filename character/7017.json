  "description" : "The person with the unenviable task of finding a human with the Net Terminal Gene within the Megastructure to access the Netsphere. He is equipped with a Gravitational Beam Emitter (GBE), a petite but powerful weapon capable of creating holes miles long in the Megastructure. He is soon joined by Cibo in his quest.\nLooking to be in his early to mid 20`s, he is a glum looking person, never smiling (except madly when shooting on occasion) and has a slight slouch in his normal standing position, he isn`t afraid to fight, and readily shoots the GBE. He also often shows superhuman strength and endurance, being thrown through solid walls and floors before standing right back up with no apparent injuries. The GBE is so powerful that he`s flung backwards by its sheer power, often into walls and the ground, but he always gets up. Even in its lowest power, his arm jerks up and back from the force of it. During the encounter with the giant Safeguard outside Toha Heavy Industries, he fires at the Safeguard with the GBE at Level 4 Extra power level. The recoil from the GBE is so powerful that he is thrown back a considerable distance, his right arm badly broken and exposing bone and tissue. He heals very quickly, as well, recovering from more serious injuries much more rapidly than an average human. In the times when it`s quiet, he injects drugs into himself in the forehead, and when he`s low on power, he may inject it straight into his hand.",
