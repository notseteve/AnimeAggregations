  "description" : "Miyu is a blonde and good-natured girl, whose parents leave for the United States to work for NASA at the beginning of the series, arranging for her to stay with their long-time family friend, Hosho Saionji, a monk who lives at an old shrine atop a hill. However, the monk himself leaves soon after for India on a year-long voyage, leaving Miyu in having to stay in the same house with his son, Kanata. Initially disliking the idea of living in the same house with a boy, Miyu often fought with Kanata at the beginning of the series, but finds out from her mother that she was friends with him when they were both toddlers, and starts to like him more and more as the story progresses. She feels a deep affection for Luu, who likens her to his mother due to their similar looks. She also for a while had feelings for Mizuki Yamamura, Mikan Yamumura`s cute younger brother. She often becomes tired because of her parents` antics of always deserting her because of their busy schedules and using her to fulfill their wishes, a fact that has always been so ever since she was a child. Despite this, Miyu stays cheerful and friendly and cares tremendously about the people close to her.",
