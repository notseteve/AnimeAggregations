  "description" : "Appearing as a mushroom humanoid, Fungus is one of the four Lords of Gaudium and is always seen with a pipe in his mouth. Originally from a world of mushrooms, Fungus was a general until a mysterious mushroom-eating mold manifested on his world by Chaos. Only Fungus survived and became a servant of the Earl. Fungus is virtually immortal, and will always reappear after losing a fight against Kaze, though as a 1/10th miniature of himself and must wait for some time before regaining his original stature.\nWhen the Lords of Gaudium were sent to find the innate pieces of Omega, Fungus failed to find any. Fungus was desperate to impress the Earl, losing his trust from each losing battle. However, Oscha offers to give Fungus a edge against Kaze by bring him to what remained of his homeworld. There Fungus draws power from his homeworld during his fight with Kaze, regenerating into a giant. However, though he was winning, the Earl and Oscha planned to dispose of the useless Fungus by using the same mold that destroyed his world to finish the job and infect him. Seeing him in misery, Kaze ended his suffering with Fungus thanking him in his final moments and acknowledging him to be the better man.",
