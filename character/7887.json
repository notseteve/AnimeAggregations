  "description" : "Hellmaster Phibrizzo was created during the Shinma War, and is over 5000 years old. Though the Shinma War has ended, the overall conflict between shinzoku and mazoku has not. Shabranigdu at some point created five subordinates of his own: Hellmaster Fibrizo, Chaos Dragon Garv, Greater Beast Zelas Metallium, Dynast Grausherra, and Deep Sea Dolphin.\nHellmaster Phibrizzo is the strongest of the five subordinates in service to Ruby Eye Shabranigdu, lord of the underworld, and controller of life and death. Hellmaster`s priest and general were destroyed in the Kouma War, and it is assumed that to create new ones would deplete much of his existing power.\nDespite his power and eagerness to fulfill his master`s goals of destroying everything in existence, Phibrizzo rarely involved himself in the day to day matters of the world; he was more of the scheming type. He was known to patiently wait for hundreds or even thousands of years, and when everything was in place, unleash his plan to the most devastating effect. He was the one who ignited the Kouma War, which at first was a conflict between humans, to use the horrors of the war to awaken the piece of Shabranigdu in Lei Magnus, one of the Five Great Sages. He apparently succeeded, turning the war into one of the greatest conflicts of all time. However, in the end, Lei Magnus-Shabranigdu was sealed into ice, and Phibrizzo`s ultimate goal wasn`t achieved.",
