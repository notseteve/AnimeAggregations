  "description" : "Negoro Shinobu is No.5 of the Muto-assassination team, he is an extremely cold character. Almost always hidden inside his own `space` created by his Buso Renkin, the Secret Trail. His clothes and his hair are sewn into it as well. The opposite of Ikusabe, he cares about claiming victory more than the process of beating his enemies. He was later defeated by Gouta when he hid in his own space after being ambushed by Gouta`s Motor Gear, only to have the two chakrams hit him again as both chakrams had Negoro`s own blood. He is able to become completely unnoticed in a crowd of people.",
