  "description" : "Alister, otherwise known as Alice, is the eight-highest ranking maid of the Nogizaka family, and is in charge of security. She looks like a grade school student, and is a blond Caucasian (most likely German, since she once utters \"Bruder\", which conveys the same meaning as Mika`s \"Onii-san\", when addressing Yuuto). She rarely speaks (being not yet skilled in Japanese), and normally converses with others via an array of nods and head-shakes to express her meanings.",
