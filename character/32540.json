In the manga, he only appeared in one frame in the background but in the anime he appeared a number of times. His parts largely has nothing to do with the main story.\nHe harbours feelings for Sawawa, however Sawawa doesn`t seem to understand his advances. He treats her to free parfaits, gives her lottery tickets, and even wanted to rename the café \"Sawawa\", with his gifts becoming more elaborate each time. The name of the café is unknown in the manga, but in the anime it`s called \"Dandy\".",
