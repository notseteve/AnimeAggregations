  "description" : "A bashful crybaby in kindergarten, in fact Shun calls her `Rurippe` (pronounced \"RU-RI-PE\") for that. Once she cried when she broke her teacher`s vase, but Shun steps on it to take the blame instead. When Shun left was about to leave the neighborhood, she confessed her feelings for Shun. Shun denied her because she was a sniveler. Shun did sound rude but he still gave her his toy as a remembrance of their friendship.\nProbably it was in first year when her power awakened. One rainy day, she encountered a dying kitten. She took it to a veterinary clinic, which was closed so she tried to do something about it until her healing power (Gate of Life) broke free and healed the kitten.\nShe has changed since then. In high school, she`s the richest, most intelligent and the most popular student in school and is viewed as a model student and an active participant in school activities.\nShe is the first recruited Gate Keeper member of the Far East Branch AEGIS, and she has received official training directly from them.",
