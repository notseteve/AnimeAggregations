  "description" : "Kricketot has two large antennae function not only as feelers, but also as a musical instrument. In order to create sounds, it swings its head around, causing the feelers to collide and make a sound like a xylophone. Kricketot`s design is based on a composer or conductor; its body resembles an orchestra conductor`s costume. Kricketot only learns growl and bide similar to Seedot.\nCollars of the female are noticeably larger than those of the male.\nAlso, it should be noticed that the antenna of Kricketot appear to be a raised version of Kricketune`s mustache.\nOddly, it is strikingly similar to Volbeat and Illumise, due to similar head collars, and that it has antennas. However, besides the fact that they are both bug types, they are not related in any way.",
