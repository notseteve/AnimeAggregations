Caitlin battled against Cynthia in a 10 minute exhibition match during the opening of the Pokémon World Tournament Junior Cup at the Kagome Town stadium.

Caitlin was very grateful for the opportunity to battle against Cynthia and the two of them hoped to be able to battle again sometime in the future.",
