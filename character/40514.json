  "description" : "While Professor Icarus was testing out his miniature flying disc, it crashed into the forest and hit Ligray and injured it slightly. Professor Icarus returned to his lab with the Ligray to treat its injuries. Ligray recovered soon after the incident and decided to stay with Professor Icarus but it was very shy and timid. The two got used to each other and they decided to keep it secret from the people in Area 28 that they lived together.\nProfessor Icarus`s Ligray understood the fact that Professor Icarus wanted to do his research in peace so whenever the nearby residents came to his lab, Ligray would use its psionic powers to confuse them and give them headaches to they wouldn`t return.\nWhen Ash and his friends were heading to the lab across the bridge, Professor Icarus`s Ligray saved Ash from falling through a broken board on the bridge. It also used its foresight to inform Professor Icarus when he was having tea with Ash and his friends that his UFO was about to overload and explode.\nTeam Rocket heard rumours of a Pok√©mon that was said to have come from space was in the area. They spotted Ligray and attempted to capture it but thanks to Ash and his friends they were able to rescue it. After that incident with Team Rocket, Professor Icarus stated that he was going to go to space with Ligray but Ligray indicated that it enjoyed spending time with Professor Icarus the way it was currently.",
