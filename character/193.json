  "description" : "Wolfgang Mittermeyer was an Imperial Fleet Admiral who served as the Supreme Space Fleet Commander under http://anidb.net/ch186 [Reinhard von Lohengramm] and was a skilled tactician, becoming one of the two \"Twin Pillars\" of Reinhard`s Goldenl√∂we Dynasty. For his lightning-fast tactics in combat, Mittermeyer was known by the nickname of \"Gale Wolf.\" He was a close friend of Fleet Admiral http://anidb.net/ch194 [Oskar von Reuenthal], another brilliant commander and the second member of the Twin Pillars, with whom he served as one of the two best commanders in Reinhard`s New Galactic Empire. With the deaths of http://anidb.net/ch187 [Siegfried Kircheis], Reuenthal, and http://anidb.net/ch195 [Paul von Oberstein], Mittermeyer was the last of Reinhard von Lohengramm`s early supporters against the Goldenbaum Dynasty and high nobles left alive.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
