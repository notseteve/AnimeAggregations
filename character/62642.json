  "description" : "The Greek God of the Underworld. He is also said to have misfortune and often isolates himself from interacting with others, as he thinks of himself as unlucky and cursed. He`s Apollon`s uncle and Zeus` older brother. He has an aura which makes everyone difficult to approach him. Despite being cold on the outside, Hades is soft on the inside, having quite a sweet tooth as well.\nDue to the grudges held by the dead in the underworld, Hades has gained a curse that causes misfortune wherever he goes, hence he prefers to stay in the underworld away from contact.",
