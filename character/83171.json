  "description" : "Morgana is a mysterious cat-like creature whom Ren and Ryuuji first encounter in the dungeons of Kamoshida`s Palace, when they inadvertently stumble into it on what should have been Ren`s first day at Shuujin Academy. He teaches them the ins and outs of the Metaverse, Palaces, and Personas. He later appears to them in the real world as an ordinary domestic cat. Only people like them who have been able to enter the Metaverse can hear him speak in the real world, everyone else just hears him meowing. His true origins are a mystery even to him and he works as one of the Phantom Thieves in mostly in an attempt to seek answers, though he is convinced that he must have once been human. In the Metaverse he can also transform into a van which the Phantom Thieves can ride.",
