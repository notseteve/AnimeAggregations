  "description" : "The fourth Angel, Shamshel, is a massive, vaguely arthropod-like creature, with a long cylindrical body, a roughly shovel-shaped head with two eyespot-like markings, and eight retractable segmented limbs. It also has two short \"arms\" that project energy whips, which can easily slice through objects and may also be used to manipulate objects. Shamshel remains horizontal during flight; during combat it raises itself upright by 90 degrees, with the \"head\" remaining parallel to the ground. Its core is located under its \"throat\".\nShamshel was engaged by Shinji in Unit 01. During the battle, Unit 01`s umbilical cable was severed by Shamshel`s energy whips, and Shinji had to fight the Angel on battery power. Ignoring orders to retreat, Shinji inflicted a fatal wound to the Angel`s core using Unit 01`s progressive knife, killing it seconds before Unit 01`s batteries expired. The minimal damage to Shamshel allowed Nerv to obtain a near-complete Angel specimen, although no report was ever submitted or published. Nerv was able to recover the Angel`s SÂ² engine, which the Third Branch would later attempt to install in Unit 04.",
