  "description" : "She is a younger classmate in Keiichi`s school, and is in the same grade level as Satoko. Naturally, she is great friends with her, as they live together in the same house. She is revered by the villagers as the heir of the local shrine, and plays the role of a miko in the annual Watanagashi Festival. She has been the head of the Furude house since her parents died, but rarely attends town meetings due to her young age. While she does speak in normal context, she likes to say nonsense words such as \"mi~\" and \"nipa~\" and often ends her sentences with \"-nano desu\" (\"it is so\"), which inflame Rena`s passion for cute things.",
