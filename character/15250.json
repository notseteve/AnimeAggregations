  "description" : "The manager of Café Latte and Misaki`s boss, a 30 year old woman who has a tendency to voice out her fantasies. She is a cheerful woman who enjoys her job because it allows her to make others happier. She is very understanding of Misaki`s circumstances, knowing that Misaki does not particularly enjoy working at a maid café, and is perceptive of other people`s feelings. Satsuki also ends up hiring Usui as a part-time cook, much to Misaki`s chagrin.",
