He would only take Kumasyun for a walk every now and then. Chris was looking for his Kumasyun when he met `Detective` Cilan who decided he would help find Kumasyun.\nBeing a young boy, Chris is a bit naive and didn`t realize that his Kumasyun might want to do other things other than live in its well provided for Pokémon House. After finding out that his Kumasyun had made friends with a Yogiras, Chris` attitude changed a bit and he began contemplating the idea of going on his own journey. He then decided to practice battling with Kumasyun and if he was able to get Yogiras, he`d start a journey.",
