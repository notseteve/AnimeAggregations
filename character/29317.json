She is later found out to be a creation of Sukyura cells and human cells; basically a result of when Shuhei and Nao consummated their relationship (In a way, she is their \"child\"). She calls Shuuhei, her `father`, and Nao, her `mother`. In the end, she became the one that destroyed Cellaria, as she was the only who can counter Cellaria`s ability to spread Sukyura cells.",
