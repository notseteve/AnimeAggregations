  "description" : "Blanka is a fighter from Brazil. He was once human, but after being struck by a lightning during the plane crash he mutated, resulting in his green colouring and his ability to generate electricity.\nBlanka fights in a self-taught, animalistic style. In several of his special moves he rolls into a ball, launching himself at an opponent. In Blanka`s signature attack, he crouches and emits an electric current shocking anything it touches.\nSource: Wikipedia",
