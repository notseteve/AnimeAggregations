  "description" : "Louis`s appearance is intense and so are his battling skills. He had a fierce battle with Alan over a Mega Stone that he just obtained. Louis`s partner Gablias can Mega Evolve into a Mega Gablias. He refers to himself as \"the great Dragon Trainer Louis\".\nDespite being a Dragon trainer, he didn`t realize that Lizardon`s type changes to Dragon when in its Mega Evolved form. That error proved to be his downfall as he lost the Mega Evolved battle against Alan.",
