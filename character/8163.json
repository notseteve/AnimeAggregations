  "description" : "Kogorou was once with the police, but due to an incident that involved his wife Eri as well, he quit. Due to the same incident, he and Eri split up.\nHe`s got custody of his daughter Ran who lives with him in an apartment that is at the same time his detective agency, on top of a café named Coffee Poirot. Despite of having been a good policeman, he`s a bad detective - but still very famous. That only comes due to the fact that Conan is \"abusing\" this adult`s sedated body to deduct his theories for the sake of outing the high amount of murderers whose crimes he solved.\nKogorou might be a smoking, drinking, good-for-nothing loudmouth with a high affection to idol Okino Youko, but he still is a good guy when it comes to handling his daughter or wife.\nDue to Conan having made him famous as the Sleeping Kogorou, he sometimes gets over his head and just believes he`s the big shot everybody else thinks he is.\nKogorou finally accepts Conan as a \"lodger\", when Conan`s \"mother\" gave him access to an account filled with 10.000.000 Yen (about 90.000€/122.500$).\nHis voice is Number 59 on Conan`s bowtie.",
