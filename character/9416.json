  "description" : "The newly appointed Director-General of the Citizen Security Bureau, who reports directly to the Regent. He and his wife took Pino as a surrogate child prior to the beginning of the series.\nInitially loyal to the system, he comes to despise the ruling order responsible for the city`s slow decay and lashes out destructively. His mentality also slowly degenerates, as he frequently has hallucinations of a smirking Vincent Law close by. He is quite skilled and accurate with a pistol (as shown in the beginning scenes of episode 17). He eventually ends up wounded when \"Real\" Mayer, a clone of the original Re-l, attacks him. He then goes in search for Pino, his only surviving loved one, but is knocked aside by an infected armed AutoReiv and falls on a large shard of glass. He eventually dies from the wound and is found by his Entourage, Kristeva.\nSource: Wiki",
