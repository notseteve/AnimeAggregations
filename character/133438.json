  "description" : "Adventurer. A veteran with a decade of experience, but no innate talent. After all these years he`s still stuck at the low rank of Bronze. Still, though, he works hard every day towards his dream of becoming a Mythril class adventurer. He actually has magical power, innate ki energy, and holy energy, but because they`re all so weak he can`t use them in combat.\nSource: Official page",
