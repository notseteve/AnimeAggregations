  "description" : "Uchida Fumiaki is a time traveler from 2012 who is sent to 1999 to find the key of Nostradamus. He was forced to be #6 after the agent before him, http://anidb.net/ch20898 [#5], was killed. In 1999, Fumiaki was a little boy with special psychic powers. Dubbed \"Uchida Bunmei\", he appeared on many television shows, demonstrating his psychic powers by bending a spoon. His popularity grew quickly, but it came at a heavy cost. As he became more popular, his mother became obsessed with his fame, to the point that she refuses him a normal social life. Fumiaki eventually loses his psychic powers, and by 2012, he was considered a fake.\nUpon arriving in 1999, Fumiaki encounters http://anidb.net/ch18062 [Maya], who at first thought of him as a coward, since all he could do is run in fear. However, he eventually earns some of http://anidb.net/ch18062 [Maya]`s respect, as http://anidb.net/ch18062 [Maya] sees part of his life in a near-death experience and realizes that he, like her, was also a lonely child. He and http://anidb.net/ch18062 [Maya] form a team to find the Nostradamus Key and prevent the alien invasion.",
