  "description" : "Yuuki Terumi is the main antagonist of the BlazBlue series. He is a ghost who has taken the alias Hazama, a captain of the NOL`s Intelligence Division. At first, he appears to be supervising Noel`s actions to keep her in line, but he has a sinister hidden agenda. He is also the creator of the BlazBlue and the mastermind responsible for cutting off Ragna`s arm, hacking off Jin`s mind, presumably killing Saya, and most likely causing the space-time distortions. Most who are aware of his presence regard him with contempt and perhaps even fear, as Rachel defiantly stands up to him in one path, but does not attack him in many of the events of BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger. Against Rachel`s warnings, Noel says the words \"Dark Susano`o\" upon looking at Terumi. Jubei and Hakumen mention that the seal holding him may have been broken and Takamagahara may have been reactivated, and Jubei notifies Hakumen of his return. He seems to be at odds with the other remaining members of the Six Heroes. Kokonoe has a murderous attitude toward him because he killed her mother, Nine, and in Terumi`s own words Rachel is the only being currently capable of \"keeping up\" with him. At the end of Story Mode, he issues confidential verbal orders to Tsubaki to kill Noel and Jin.",
