  "description" : "Naga is first introduced alongside Graffel (see below) when the latter attacks Izuma and Toujou, but maintains a detached attitude that contrasts with Graffel`s violence. He rushes with Graffel to Hecadoth`s aid against Saotome, only to be dispatched to the demon world by the teacher. It is later revealed that he is known as the Water Dragon King and his power is way above Hecatos` and Graffel`s. His black aura often takes the shape of a dragon. He is probably named after the Hindu deity. Naga is eventually defeated by Oga and Beel`s Super Milk Time.",
