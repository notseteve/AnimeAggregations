  "description" : "Rampardos is the evolution of Cranidos. Using its iron-like skull that packs enormously destructive power, it knocks down jungle trees and even the most durable objects in order to catch its prey.\nIt has the highest attack stat of any Pok√©mon, except for Attack Forme Deoxys (base 165, which translates into a cap of 472). Low defenses and Speed, though, make it a very difficult choice in any battle without proper support.",
