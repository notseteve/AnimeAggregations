  "description" : "Elizabeth resembles a giant white duck or a giant penguin and is Katsura`s companion. Elizabeth was a present from Tatsuma Sakamoto, who presumably picked it up on his travels around space. Although many people consider Elizabeth to be insane and extraneous, Katsura has named the ambiguous avian \"Elizabeth\" and dotes on it. While it appears to be just one being, Shinpachi purchased a doll named Space Alien Stefan to which looks perfectly similar to Elizabeth. Elizabeth is something of a painter, and is surprisingly dexterous. Also, Elizabeth resorts to using signboards to \"communicate\", as well as an occasional means of attack. Elizabeth is also a skilled fighter, able to use signboards to fight off swordsmen.",
