  "description" : "Oniwabanshuu were the protectors of Edo Castle during the Edo period. In Rurouni Kenshin, they are Shinomori Aoshi, Han`nya, Shikijou, Hyottoko, Beshimi, Okina, Misao, and the others at the Aoi-Ya. Aoshi`s group is referred as the Tokyo Group, while Misao and Okina`s squad are known as the Kyoto Group. After the Bakumatsu, of all of the Oniwabanshuu members, only Aoshi received job offers from government agencies, such as the intelligence services of the Army of Japan and protection services of political leaders; Aoshi instead chose to be a hired guard as his comrades would be able to work with him.\nAfter Watsuki first discussed the \"Megumi arc\" with the editor, the editor replied with the opinion that, in Watsuki`s words, \"having a swordsman of Kenshin`s caliber fighting a group of punk-thugs still coming into their first facial hair mi-i-ight not make for the most epic of manga.\" To solve this, Watsuki modified the Tokyo Oniwabanshuu to make them onmitsu (ninja; Watsuki does not like using the word \"ninja\" as he feels that using it \"like that\" is \"cheesy\"), and added details as publication progressed. Watsuki created various shapes and temperaments for the various Tokyo Oniwabanshuu characters. Watsuki describes the addition of the Oniwabanshuu as a \"last minute\" choice.\nSource: wiki",
