  "description" : "Akiyuki`s father and Fusa`s estranged husband. He`s a local doctor for his community and appears to specialize in geriatrics, as he often treats the elderly of the area. He appears to be an unkempt man as he often shows little concern for the cleanliness and appearance of both himself and his clinic. His family often comes to his office to take care of him, such as by doing his cooking and laundry. He cares more about his work than his wife and son, and was one of the last people to know about the disappearance of his son after the island was attacked, and acts rather despondent vis-Ã -vis his impotence in keeping his family together. It seems that he has a troubled past as a military researcher who worked on Northern Continent humanform weaponisation projects and now deeply regrets his involvement. He also still has ututu seeds with him that he has not parted with, even after the end of his involvement with the military. The full extent of his involvement in humanform research is not yet known. Using life support, he has been keeping alive the attempted suicide bomber whom was responsible for his son being implanted with a hiruko.",
