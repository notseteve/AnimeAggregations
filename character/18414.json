  "description" : "Fred Abberline is a young officer of Scotland Yard. In the anime adaptation, he is portrayed as one who truly believes in the justice system. He wishes to make London a place where it is safe to have a family and plans to propose to his pregnant girlfriend. Like Ciel, he had to go through hard times to reach his current situation. Despite this, Ciel describes him as someone who walks in the light, whereas Ciel walks in the darkness. At first, Abberline does not trust Ciel and his position as the Queen`s Watchdog, but later joins him as an ally. He is killed by Lau by using his body as a human shield to protect Ciel. His role in the manga adaptation is significantly shorter and he is portrayed with a moustache.",
