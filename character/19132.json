  "description" : "Jin-Crow is a mysterious birdman. Jin-Crow is a friend to Killrain, before the latter was infected by dark energy. He can still be seen at Killrain`s side, but he also searches for a way to help his friend overcome the darkness. He gives Kiriya the location of the ancient weapons, and later escorts Kiriya`s group to Bestia. In the past, he, Killrain, and Leon, Clalaclan`s older brother, swore peace to the countries, but then Shumari`s plot ruined their plans. He decides to become Xecty`s protector. Together with Saionji, Hiruda, and Xecty, they are busy restoring the forest back to its former glory.\nSource: Wikipedia",
