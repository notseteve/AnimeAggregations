  "description" : "Shinnakasu Heavy Industry`s VF-1J (the \"J\" speculated as a prideful designation of the fighter`s region of origin) is an upgraded version of the standard VF-1, typically assigned to the senior officer of an air team or to a squadron leader. Unlike Stonewell/Bellcom`s VF-1D, the VF-1J remains a single seat fighter but shares the slightly increased firepower of that variant. The new head unit of the VF-1J (developed by Kyuusei Industry) features two Mauler RÃ–V-20 anti-aircraft laser cannons in a slightly improved configuration. Naturally, when the Shinnakasu-designed GBP-1S \"Armored\" system was given first operational deployment, it was installed on a VF-1J.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/vf-1j-valkyrie.htm",
