  "description" : "As Axis/Neo Zeon begin openly moving to conquer the Earth Sphere at the outbreak of the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, they develop several prototype mobile suits to serve as testbeds for advanced new technologies. One of these prototypes is the AMX-103 Hamma Hamma, whose primary function is to test the new \"quasi-psycommu\" system. The quasi-psycommu is a computer control system designed to allow normal (non-Newtype) pilots to operate wire-guided remote weapons and conduct all-range attacks in a fashion similar to Newtype-use mobile weapons equipped with a standard psycommu system. The Hamma Hamma`s quasi-psycommu is intended to control its two wire-guided claw-hands, each of which is armed with a 3-barreled beam gun. This is the only armament mounted on the Hamma Hamma itself, as the remaining reactor output is required to operate the large number of thrusters arrayed on the massive shoulder and skirt armor of this highly maneuverable mobile suit. In order to be equipped with additional beam weaponry, the Hamma Hamma can also carry a shield that is equipped with its own independent power generator. This generator powers the weapons mounted on the shield, which include three linked beam guns, a pair of beam sabers, and a space mine launcher.\nSource: mahq.net",
