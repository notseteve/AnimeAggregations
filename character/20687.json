  "description" : "Hiroshi-kun is an anatomical figure, being Sunako`s most precious possession and best friend. Sunako often confides in him regarding her feelings about the boys and situations, although she does not get reply. Despite not being alive, Hiroshi-kun is treated like a living person, talking at the beginning of episodes in the anime, and is shown dancing in the end credits, showing great love for Sunako. Hiroshi-kun was found by Sunako in a pile of rubbish shortly after she was described as being ugly by her first crush, and she formed a bond with Hiroshi-kun, both being \"discarded\" from the world.\nSunako takes good care of Hiroshi-kun, along with her other anatomical friends (Josephine, Akira-kun, and Sergeant George). His fake organs have a habit of falling out or being removed by Sunako. The boys at first are dismissive of Sunako`s relationship with Hiroshi-kun, but eventually come to accept it over the course of the manga and anime, treating him the same way Sunako does but remembering that he is not alive. Kyouhei often threatens to destroy Hiroshi-kun when Sunako irritates him, but in one episode, he actually confides in him like Sunako. On several occasions, Hiroshi-kun is kidnapped by other characters and held to ransom. These characters include The Boss so he could meet Sunako, and a trio of obsessive fan girls of Kyouhei, Sunako risking life and limb to save Hiroshi-kun.",
