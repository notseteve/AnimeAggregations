  "description" : "* Ability: Change his shadows into clay men\nHe can create more than one clay man - even altering their appearance - which can confuse the enemy and thus keep them from finding the real Black Shadow. His favorite technique though is to create a giant clay man. If the sun disappears, so does his power.\nHe was the captain of his school basketball team, but because of an unfair ruling that disqualified his team from entering a tournament, he became the unemotional person who joined ranks with Robert.\nDuring his fight with Ueki, he was defeated by a fellow member of Robert`s Ten. Ueki luckily got through to him (with the help of Kuroki`s little brother) and even though he was knocked unconscious he becomes good again.",
