  "description" : "A brash young sibylla who joins Chor Tempest as one of three replacements for combat losses in the first battle against Argentum. She immediately takes a liking to Neviril, and pushes to become Neviril`s new Pair after Amuria is lost. Aer fits the stereotype of the fighter pilot, and has little patience for the sibyllae`s role as priestesses. She volunteered for combat after serving as a cadet on the southern front, and possesses an outstanding flying ability. Normally, she flies auriga, whether it`s with Neviril or other sybillae.",
