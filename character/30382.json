  "description" : "The protagonist of the story. A second year high school student who discovers Subaru`s secret. Frequently just referred to as Jirou, he suffers gynophobia in which his nose bleeds whenever a girl touches him. He reveals the cause to be his mother and sister practicing their wrestling moves on him on a daily basis for 10 years as part of his training, he states his nose bleeds when a girl touches him because his body developed the reflex because he believed his mother and sister would stop beating him up once he started bleeding (as his blood would ruin the carpet). As a result, he can take pain well and is fairly competent as a fighter which is kept sharp by his sister, Kureha, who wakes him up every morning with a series of beatings. He is shown to enjoy instant noodles. When he was young, his father passed away from an illness but not before telling him that his name means \"Stand by me\" telling him to become a man strong enough to tell others \"I will protect you so stay by my side\" which sometimes causes him to wonder whether he can keep that promise. He was forced to sign a contract with Kanade to not reveal the secret of Subaru and find a way to cure his gynophobia. He hates it when people call him his full name as, due to the Japanese culture of putting the family name before their given name, it creates a pun on the english word chicken as his full name is Sakamachi Kinjirou.\nSource: Wikipedia",
