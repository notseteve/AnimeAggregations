  "description" : "Meltan is a Steel-type Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation VII in Pokémon: Let`s Go, Pikachu! and Let`s Go, Eevee!.\nIn Pokémon GO, it evolves into Melmetal by using 400 Meltan Candy. It cannot be evolved in other games.\nIts appearance was first teased during the September Pokémon GO Community Day on September 22, 2018, and it was officially revealed on September 25, 2018.\nMeltan is a small Pokémon with a silvery body of liquid metal. Its head resembles a golden hexagonal nut with small black sphere floating inside. This sphere serves as its eye. It has a red tail that resembles an electrical wire with two tiny protrusions at the end. Its body can corrode metal, which it then absorbs. Meltan can generate electricity using the metal it absorbs, and then fire it from its eye.\nAccording to Professor Willow, Meltan has been described in ancient texts found in the same place as the Mystery Box, a mysterious item that attracts Meltan to its location when opened. Professor Willow also states that Meltan is said to be created when it splits from Melmetal. As seen in the anime, the hexagonal nut on its body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. When provoked, it will spin its heads, creating a sound that calls others of its own kind. This head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection. The anime has also shown Meltan can be tamed if fed metal-like treats. Meltan is one of the smallest Pokémon, tying with Alolan Diglett and Klefki as the shortest Steel-type.",
