  "description" : "Ueki`s adoptive mother. She died in a car accident the same day in which Ueki arrived on Earth. She is the first person God meets while on a trip on Earth twenty years before when he is a newly elected god, when she was a high school student.\nOddly enough, her maiden surname is Ueki and she mentions that she has a boyfriend who is a writer, which is also Gengoro`s occupation. This could mean that either she`s related to her husband, that they have the same surname by coincidence, that she lied and they were already married, or that Gengoro took on her surname after their marriage, which is not all that uncommon in Japan. . Her daughter is her spitting image with the exception that Haruko wears her hair in a ponytail.",
