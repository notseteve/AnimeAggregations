  "description" : "Mariya is Mizuho`s childhood friend who knows him very well. When it was decided that Mizuho would transfer to the all-girls school she also attends, she took it upon herself to transform him into a beautiful girl by use of makeup and seemed to have a lot of fun dressing him up. Mariya has a very spirited personality which she uses often to make sure Mizuho is acting feminine in every way: appearance, mannerisms, and even speech. This often includes using mild violence. Also, she has a temper, of which she has little control and which sometimes causes her to do unadvisable things or carry grudges to an extreme - such as her grudge against Takako.",
