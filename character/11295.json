  "description" : "A Serbian Orthodox nun that serves at St. Mihailov in a variety of ordinary chores, such as taking care of children in the school`s kindergarten or tending to flowers, she is the only survivor of a brutal massacre occurred in Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars, where an expedition led by Croa raped and slaughtered all the inhabitants of Teresa`s church. Due to her assisting at the whole carnage while hidden, she became completely emotionless and stopped smiling, crying or feeling anything, and thus is presented as almost ghostly due to her quietness. Only when Croa reappears and Teresa has to recall the brutalities of her past, does she gain enough courage to face them and begin to show emotions again. She usually provides Sasha with her Soma, but can hold her own in combat by means of martial arts, a bow and huge blades concealed in her skirt.",
