In the main Pok√©mon game series, an Arbok is only acquired when an Ekans grows past level 22 and is evolved into an Arbok. It physically resembles a cobra and its name is the reverse of \"kobra.\" The face-like pattern on the inside of its hood is regionally unique.\nAlong with Weezing, Arbok is often associated with Team Rocket because of its role in the anime.",
