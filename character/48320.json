  "description" : "Chris` Cubchoo lives in Chris family`s Pokémon House. Chris would locked the door at night and returned to his own room and would only take Kumasyun for a walk every now and then. One night a Yogiras came to the window and saw Chris` Cubchoo inside. It unlocked the door and the two of them went under a nearby wall to go play in the forest.\nBeing a young boy, Chris is a bit naive and didn`t realize that his Kumasyun might want to do other things other than live in its well provided for Pokémon House. After finding out that his Kumasyun had made friends with a Yogiras, Chris` attitude changed a bit and he began contemplating the idea of going on his own journey. He then decided to practice battling with Kumasyun and if he was able to get Yogiras, he`d start a journey.\nNone of Chris` Cubchoo moves are known.",
