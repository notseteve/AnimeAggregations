  "description" : "Lambo is a cow suit-clad 5-year-old assassin from Italy affiliated with the Bovino (\"Bovino\" means \"cow\" in Italian) Famiglia. He has a huge afro (which he stores a variety of objects in, such as snacks and weapons) with horns on the sides of his head. Despite being a hitman, he lacks the emotional maturity and discipline that Reborn has and is also very conceited as well as being a crybaby. In order to prove that he is worthy of becoming his own family`s boss, he comes to Japan to kill Reborn, though he only proves that he is no match for the Vongola hitman. His main choice of weapons are hand grenades, and his future dream is to rule the world. He also possesses his family`s Ten-Year Bazooka, which replaces his present self with another version of himself ten years into the future. The 15-year-old Lambo remains a crybaby, though his good looks make him more charming to others.",
