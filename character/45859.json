  "description" : "Kenso`s Mienshao and Kenso`s Watchog had a double battle against Suwama`s Heatmor and Suwama`s Emboar at the Astilbe Town Battle Club. The battle with Suwama didn`t last very long but it garnered a lot of attention as they were both quickly overpowered after using their initial attacks. Suwama`s Heatmor knocked them both to the ground and then Suwama`s Emboar knocked them both out at the same time with a powerful Hammer Arm. After the battle though, Suwama confronted Kenso and tried to get him to give up his Pok√©mon.",
