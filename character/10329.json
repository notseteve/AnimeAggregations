  "description" : "Hagane Kotetsu is a Chuunin from http://anidb.net/ch8864 [Konohagakure]. He spends most of the time with his partner, http://anidb.net/ch17145 [Kamizuki Izumo]. Kotetsu wears a bandage across his face over his nose. At one point, http://anidb.net/ch7742 [Asuma], Izumo and http://anidb.net/ch8615 [Shikamaru] asked him about this, and pointed out that he hadn`t worn it when he was a child. Later, he agreed to take the bandage off, but then Shikamaru said that knowing what was under it would only be troublesome, much to Kotetsu`s chagrin, so the reason for the bandage over his nose remains unknown.",
