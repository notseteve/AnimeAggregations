  "description" : "Megumi is ranked 4th in school and is Jun`s older twin sister. She is the daughter of a famous vocalist and music producer and shares her brother`s love of music. A cute and nice girl who rarely joins in disputes, Megumi is always quiet and refuses to speak because she wants to save her voice for singing. She usually writes on a sketchpad to communicate with others, but will speak when deeply upset (usually in the form of a shout), which can generally have devastating after-effects. She rarely speaks to people normally on a consistent basis with the exception of Yahiro, who encourages her to sing.",
