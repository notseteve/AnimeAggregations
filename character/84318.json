Among the Imuchakk Tribe girls, she is noted to be the most beautiful.\nBefore Hinahoho went to conquer the dungeon, she seemed to like him and happily accepted his hand in marriage. Although Hinahoho loves his wife dearly, there are times when she frightens him.\nRurumu made it her job to teach http://anidb.net/ch71398 [Ja`far] and http://anidb.net/ch63160 [Sinbad] how to read, write, and use mathematics as they sailed to Reim. Although she is a little rough with Ja`far, she stated she treated him as if he were her own son.\nSource: Magi Wiki, edited.",
