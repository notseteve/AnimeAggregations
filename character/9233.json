  "description" : "The final member of the \"Idol\" team, Tycho is brash, impulsive, and utterly determined (at least in the beginning) to best Lal`C`s longstanding kill record, seeing it as a chance to wipe the normally smug look off the face of the teacher`s pet (another of Lal`C`s nicknames among the members of the Fraternity). She has a low opinion of Topless in general (despite the fact that she`s a Topless herself) due to an event in her childhood where - in spite of her powers - she was unable to cure the illness of a close friend, and is annoyed by Nono`s constant attempts to prove herself worthy to become a Buster Machine pilot. Ironically, it is Nono who later helps her change her way of thinking for the better. While it isn`t outwardly implied, the two become friends, though not on the same level as Nono and Lal`C.",
