Ash`s Fletchling evolved into Ash`s Fletchinder during a battle against Nami`s Talonflame.\nEvolving into Fletchinder\nNami challenged Ash Ketchum to a sky battle and initially chose Ash`s Fletchling to battle her but Nami`s Talonflame thought it was too weak to battle against and wanted to battle Ash`s Hawlucha instead. Ash Ketchum made a deal with her that if Ash`s Hawlucha defeated her Fiarrow, that Ash`s Fletchling could battle it also. Nami ended up winning that match and Ash`s Hawlucha was defeated. Not long after though, Nami`s Talonflame was captured by Rocket Gang and with the assistance of Ash`s Fletchling, it was set free.\nNami`s Talonflame wanted to battle Ash`s Fletchling after the events of Rocket Gang`s interference proved to it that Ash`s Fletchling was a strong opponent despite its initial impression. Nami`s Talonflame ended up being defeated after Ash`s Fletchling evolved into Ash`s Fletchinder during the battle.",
