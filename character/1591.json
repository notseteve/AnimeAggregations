  "description" : "The 16-year-old male protagonist, a bread artisan who dreams of making the perfect Japan. Initially, he doesn`t seem very bright, but when it comes to bread, he`s a genius. (He is knowledgeable about rice because he lived on a rice farm, and Japanese food in general, due to further learning and dealing with Japanese restaurants.) Azuma also has \"Solar Hands\": exceptionally warm hands that allow the yeast to ferment faster and better when he is making his bread. Eternally optimistic and cheerful, he never gets upset from challenges faced in baking competitions, but rather from emotional tragedies that occur to characters around him. He gets his inspirations for his Japan from seemingly random sources, like other Japanese foods and stories from his experienced but over-talkative grandfather, who is a rice farmer.",
