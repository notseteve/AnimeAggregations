  "description" : "Another of the Original Dozen, Westa wields authority alongside Volk, but has a much more peaceful approach to solving problems. She cares a great deal for the people of the planet, and her concern for them, combined with the fact that she does not age due to the same life-lengthening technology as Volk, has caused many of them to revere \"Goddess Westa\" almost as a deity.",
