  "description" : "A Peacemaker or human-shaped weapon programmed to destroy the Scrapped Princess. She wore one of a pair of earring charms which Pacifica gave her when she was Cin/Suin, which she continues to wear even after reverting back to her Peacemaker form. Later in the show, possibly because of her time as Cin/Suin, Cz`s mentality is affected and she begins to sympathize with the humans, and later shows some reluctance to go on a mass killing spree. This seems to develop largely from her assignment to follow Shannon (in case he should find Pacifica), as she learns of his motivations and philosophy even while stating she doesn`t care about them. (Note also in Episode 18, the two share an umbrella in a scene that mirrors Shannon/Suin`s first meeting). Cz is an artillery type cosmos guardian. She appears to look like an attractive woman with long dark hair, but wears an outfit that looks rather different from the humans and is similar to what Steyr wears. Destroyed in last episode when she purposely drops her defenses taking a shot in the head from D-Knight Shannon.",
