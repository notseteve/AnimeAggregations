  "description" : "17 years old, and a second-year student at Seisho Academy. Daisuke`s one real friend, and the only person who understands him. He acts as a buffer between the selfish Daisuke and the S.D.S. He`s always chipper and upbeat, but at the same time self-effacingly says that he \"has no luck\". He clearly remembers Milo`s words to him from the kidnapping incident, \"Accept everything\", and for this reason a part of him seems like he`s given up.\nSource: Official page",
