  "description" : "It is implied Alucard is the most powerful vampire currently in existence; he has a vast range of supernatural techniques including enhanced strength, which allows him to wield pistols too heavy for humans to handle. He fights with ferocity and often extreme cruelty, rarely shooting to kill until his target has been disabled and humiliated, while frequently giving his enemies more than one chance to kill him before retaliating. He admits he is a \"monster\".",
