  "description" : "Stresemann is a highly respected and internationally famous conductor who comes to Momogaoka Music Academy as a guest instructor. In love with the Academy`s director, he comes as a favor and is immediately pegged as an oddball lecher. Perverted, demanding, and not at all dignified, Stresemann seems to be the opposite of what is expected from a man of his reputation. He, however, immediately takes to Nodame, and even accepts Chiaki as his one and only apprentice after repeatedly rejecting his application to enroll in his conducting classes. His wild behavior constantly gets Chiaki in trouble, but he also teaches him how to feel and express music in a way that only he can. He often takes his orchestra out for mixers or group dates, and goes to night clubs and host clubs (especially Club One More Kiss) instead of attending the rehearsals he is supposed to conduct. He also gets drunk easily, forcing Chiaki to take over for him as assistant conductor.\nAdapted from Wikipedia",
