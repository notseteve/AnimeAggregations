She is the younger sister of one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Sani. She blushes whenever Toriko talks to her (even if he just says her name) or does something kind. She seems to have a weakness for sweets. She is protective of Toriko, as shown when Sani touches his cheek and comments on his skin and Rin gets flustered and tells Sani not to touch Toriko. She also seems to have been implanted with Gourmet Cells.",
