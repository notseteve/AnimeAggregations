  "description" : "This class of destroyer is the smallest vessel in the Crossbone Vanguard space fleet, only a third of the size of the flagship Zamouth Garr. Due to its small size, the Zamouth Nahda has no internal hangars or catapults, and carries its mobile suits on external storage platforms. As with other Crossbone Vanguard ships, its bridge can retract into its hull for protection, and can also detach to become an emergency escape craft.",
