She`s a member of the Eastern Forces that serve the Tenko Family.\nMiria is shown to be a dutiful and serious individual but is also still childish. She desires to become part of the Tenko Family and is willing to use any opportunity to do so. However, she has displayed a considerate side when she decides not to reveal Yuuna`s true identity as a Tenko after seeing Yuuna`s happy in the Yuragi-sou with her friends. This side of her is seen again when she chooses to help Yuuna and some of her friends despite Yuuna being chased by Ouga Makyouin, a Yatahagane, under the suspicions she is an evil entity called Garandou. She also has a fair amount of pride like disliking being called a bakekitsune, and was shocked, if not also annoyed, at Koyuzu`s skills in transformation and possession which is something she also excels at.",
