  "description" : "Laura Bodewig is a first year student at the IS academy and is the IS cadet representative from Germany. A genetically-engineered super-soldier, Laura is a member of the German military and holds the rank of second lieutenant. She has red eyes and long silver hair. Her most distinct feature is a black eye patch covering her left eye. Her left eye glows yellow, the result of a failed nano-machine experiment that was meant to help her pilot an IS better. Laura was under Chifuyu`s tutelage when the latter was in the German army and holds Chifuyu in high regard as Chifuyu helped her and was her role model when she suffered a depression for not being the strongest.\nLaura`s original purpose for coming to the IS academy is to punish Ichika, who she blames for his sister withdrawing from the 2nd IS International Fighting Tournament. She was unaware that Ichika has been kidnapped and that Chifuyu had withdrawn in order to go save him. She at first easily defeats Ling and Cecilia but loses to Ichika. In desperation, she vows to kill him and goes berserk but is defeated again by Ichika who also calms and consoles her in the Inter-IS subspace. Upon learning Ichika`s strength is his freedom to choose and helping those around him and Chifuyu`s advice, Laura realises how special Ichika really is and decides to become Ichika`s bodyguard to protect him against the other girls as his \"bride\" (a misunderstanding of her knowledge of Japanese culture).\nSource: Wiki",
