  "description" : "Yanagisawa Naoko is one of Sakura`s elementary school classmates and friends. She is also on the cheerleading squad with Sakura. Naoko loves to read, particularly fantasy stories and ghost stories. She finds mysterious situations fascinating and shows no fear of scary situations. In the 31st episode of the anime adaptation, Naoko accidentally acquires the The Create card, which had disguised itself as a book. In book form, The Create would create anything that Naoko wrote in the book, though she was unaware of it. This results in Sakura and company having to deal with a confusing area of odd mystical creatures and circumstances, including a fire-breathing dragon. When she goes to bed and closes the book, the card`s power is stopped and Sakura is able to capture it. When Naoko wakes in the morning to find the book gone, she thinks it disappeared from a supernatural experience and is happy.",
