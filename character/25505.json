  "description" : "Fuser is a huge, darkly clad and masked being, he is the evil genius in charge of the renegade Outriders. He created the Vapor Trail that allows the Outriders to cross from their dimension into the human dimension and he is the mastermind behind their insidious schemes. In the last episodes of the series it is revealed that he is a cyborg, and his consciousness also existed as the Nth Degree, a powerful computer on the Outrider`s artificial homeworld.\nRichard is the only member of the Star Sheriffs to meet Fuser one-on-one. In the episode Stampede, the two faced each other in a laser sword duel after Richard crossed into the Vapor Zone in the wake of an Outrider ship travelling along the Vapor Trail. When Richard was on the verge of winning the duel, Fuser saved himself by emptying the oxygen from the chamber where they were fighting (Outriders do not need oxygen), rendering Richard unconscious.",
