  "description" : "A half demon and one of the two sons of Sparda, Vergil and Dante. Dante operates as a mercenary, mostly accepting jobs involving the supernatural. He has a fondness for strawberry sundaes and pizza, and a source of comic relief in the series is his indebtedness and apparent lack of gambling skill. He has a pair of custom-made black and white pistols (Ebony and Ivory, respectively), along with his sword: Rebellion, which he carries in public in a guitar case.",
