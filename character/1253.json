  "description" : "Tangrowth, known as the Vine Pokémon, is the evolution of Tangela as of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl when Tangela learns the attack, Ancientpower, paralleling Yanmega`s and Mamoswine`s evolutions. Tangrowth, like Tangela, is mostly covered in thick, curly blue vines. As with Tangela, its white eyes are visible beneath them. It has thick, black legs with rounded pink feet. It also has two long, viny arms with three fingers each. Females tend to have more red on the fingers. Tangrowth uses its arms to trip prey. It also doesn`t mind if its arms get torn off by enemies, because they soon regrow. Tangrowth`s vines also seem to have morphed together, whereas Tangela`s vines are all completely separate. Tangela must learn AncientPower in order to evolve in Tangrowth.",
