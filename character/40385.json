  "description" : "Luke`s Zorua helps him by transforming into characters for his movies by using its Illusion ability. Ash first encountered Luke`s Zorua just after he finished watching the trailer for \"Miracle Fighter the Movie Part 24: The Mystery of the Miracle Shooter\" and he turned around to see the Miracle Fighter right behind him. Luke`s Zorua then transformed back into its normal Zorua state and Ash thought about catching it until Luke came running saying it was his Zorua.\nZorua was mad at Luke because she only wanted to play the role of Princess Julia in the movie and not all the other cast members. Once Cilan and his friends figured that out, they decided to help Luke with the movie which made Luke`s Zorua happy.\nLuke met his Zorua while helping out Matthew with the projection machines. Every movie, Zorua would transform into the main heroine and watch the movie. Eventually Luke figured out that it was Zorua transforming and then asked Zorua if it wanted to help him with a movie he was making. From then on, Zorua became Luke`s partner in making productions.",
