  "description" : "Koharu is a Pokémon Trainer that has a very selfish Gothita. Koharu and Koharu`s Gothita form a combo and are now visiting gyms in the Unova region. At the time she met Ash and his friends, Koharu had two badges: the Basic Badge and the Insect Badge. Koharu tends to follow the will of her Gothita and spoils it a bit by abiding by whatever it wants to do despite her initial thoughts and reactions to a situation.\nWhen Koharu`s Gothita decided that it liked Ash`s Scraggy, Koharu`s Gothita instructed Koharu to send out all her Pokémon so Ash could decide which one of her Pokémon he`d trade with. When Ash said he wasn`t willing to trade, Koharu`s Gothita got upset and in order to please it, Koharu`s attitude changed as she tried to persuade Ash by playing to his vanity. After numerous suggestions that Ash was a weak opponent, Ash agreed to battle against Koharu and if he lost he would trade his Zuruggu. Koharu lost the battle though and Ash`s Scraggy wasn`t traded to her but Koharu`s Gothita got really mad at her for losing.\nDespite submitting to Koharu`s Gothita selfish attitude, Koharu seems to be a nice trainer and was planing to head to Raimon City next as she was a big fan of Elesa. Koharu was last seen chasing after her Gothita as it ran off into the distance after it lost the battle against Ash`s Snivy.",
