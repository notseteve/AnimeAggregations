  "description" : "The Hambrabi is another prototype transformable mobile suit created by Paptimus Scirocco, whose simple design makes it more suitable for mass production. Although its generator power and thruster output are relatively low, the Hambrabi is very manoeuvrable, and - since it can use its hand weapons and forearm claws even in its mobile armour form - it has excellent melee combat capabilities. Yazan Gable and his wingmen use their trio of Hambrabis in closely coordinated team manoeuvres, employing electrical weapons like the \"sea serpent\" and \"spider web\" for tricky surprise attacks.",
