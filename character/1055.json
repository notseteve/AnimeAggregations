  "description" : "Feebas is an aquatic Pokémon which can survive in both fresh and salt water thanks to its hardy nature. It prefers best ponds that are filled with weeds. Feebas has an unattractive, shabby appearance and it looks weak and worthless, as its fins are ragged and tattered from the moment of its birth. It is hard to find, but it is an easy Pokémon to catch if encountered since it is slow and dimwitted, but not many people in the Pokémon world take the trouble to capture, study or raise it, as they find it a boring species.",
