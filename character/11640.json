  "description" : "Vincent`s personal servant. She is somehow emotionless, like a puppet and she treats Vincent`s words as law. Oz calls her \"Echo-chan\". Echo fights with blades that come out of her long sleeves. It may seem that Vincent treasures her, but he actually does not care that much. In Chapter 23, he goes as far as to poison her to prove that the antidote for the poison that he poisoned Sharon with works. Echo is shown to have her own mind when she saves the bottle of antidote that Vincent almost drops off the veranda, because she remember what Oz said the first time they meet.\nSource: Wikipedia",
