  "description" : "Sawatari Manato is a student at St. Paulia`s Private School, and is a photographer on the school paper. He`s popular with the girls on campus, but becomes interested in Meimi after she shows interest in his photography (rather than in his looks as other girls do). Unknown to Sawatari, Meimi`s interest was false, as she was trying to obtain information for a theft. He also seems to have an interest in Meimi`s friend Seira.\nAsuka Jr. and Rina both call Sawatari by the name \"Saruwatari\" when mad with him. Saru is the Japanese word for monkey.",
