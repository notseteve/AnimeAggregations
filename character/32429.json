  "description" : "A freshman and highly capable mad scientist. She was saved by http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka] when she fell unconscious during a disastrous lab experiment, and begs to repay his kindness with sex; she joined the http://anidb.net/ch37939 [Neighbor`s Club] just to get closer to him.\nAlthough there are many adult themes in the series, she is the most sexually forward member. This was clearly highlighted in her first speaking appearance, when she described the attractions of rape to Kodaka in the middle of a stunned class. She has a habit of inserting any sexual innuendo possible in her sentences, to the point where she finds it normal to convert any innocent thought into something perverted. As a fujoshi, she is a passionate consumer of BL doujinshi and magazines, is comically aroused by intercourse between mecha, and is delighted when http://anidb.net/ch32431 [Yukimura] offers to have sex with Kodaka. Rika is proud of her perverseness, as she says that she would be a boring person if people only thought of her as a genius girl. To compound her eccentricity, she speaks in the third person.\nSource: Wiki",
