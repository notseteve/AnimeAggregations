  "description" : "Hako is an ordinary member of Tool Toul To who originally wants to become Ikki`s tuner to prove her ability. She steals the original Bagram Cores (part of the Wind Regalia) that were repaired by Kururu Sumeragi and replaces them with her own copy. She later attempts to seduce Ikki, thus becoming his tuner, but she is dismissed as being inferior to Kururu and Simca. She is eventually kidnapped and becomes Sora`s tuner. She regains her ties with her team afterwards and comes to terms with herself and her own feelings of inferiority.",
