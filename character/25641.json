  "description" : "Akemi Homura is a Puella Magi who first appears in Madoka`s dream, and then transfers into her school the day after the dream. A beautiful yet mysterious individual who performs exceptionally well in school, be it academically or athletically, making her popular at school despite her awkward personality. It is unknown whom she is contracted to, with Kyuubey identifying her as an irregular. Homura has extensive knowledge concerning different Puella Magi and is well aware of the dark sides of becoming one, believing those with kind hearts are unfit to become one. As such, she tries to keep other girls from making contracts, particularly Madoka, whom she seems to know well before their meeting. Though she is seen as something of a rival, she often strives to protect Madoka and the others from life-threatening danger. Homura has a small discus-like object strapped to her left forearm and uses it like a shield, and is able to produce various military weapons such as grenades and pistols. It is later revealed that she is from another timeline, as she has the ability to temporarily stop time, allowing her to travel quickly and get an advantage on her opponents.\nSource: Wiki",
