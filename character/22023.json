  "description" : "The eldest of the Orla family, Ril has short peach colored hair and a cool and calm disposition. He wields the Rule Fragment, \"The Ring of Thunder Beasts (來獣の指輪)\", allowing him to summon magical beasts of light. The Ring is said to be on the same level of power as Froaude`s \"Ring of the Dark Emperor\". He also possesses the Rule Fragment, \"Rock Devourer (石喰い, スパンクエル, Supan Kueru)\". In addition to that, he possesses a number of crystallized \"Cursed Eyes\" which he can invoke as weapons. Ril also appears to be knowledgeable in Cursed Eyes and Rule Fragme. When he first fought Froaude, he was demonstrated to be a quick-witted and cunning opponent, and almost killed Froaude if not for the timely arrival of Claugh. Unlike his siblings, he operates alone and carries out infiltration and assassination missions for the Gastark Empire. Later, during the battle with Geihlficlant, as Ryner was covering for Ferris, he took advantage of an opening and stole Ryner`s Alpha Stigma. Thinking that Ryner`s death was imminent, as to a Cursed Eye bearer, the eyes are as important an organ as the brain or the heart, he left the battlefield together with his siblings without realizing what he did was part of Voice`s plan in triggering off Ryner`s complete awakening.",
