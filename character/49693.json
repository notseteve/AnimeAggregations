  "description" : "Kanata is a girl at Riki`s school and is the public morals chairman, which means when Haruka causes trouble, Kanata must run after her. To help Kanata, Kudryavka offered up her two dogs Strelka and Belka to patrol the school grounds and help in hunting down Haruka when she causes trouble. Kanata is Haruka`s twin sister, though this is only revealed later. She acts extremely cold to Haruka, although it is later revealed she is forced to treat Haruka coldly by her kinsmen, and actually made efforts to release Haruka from them. Kanata is annoyed at Riki`s close approach to her sister and often tells Riki to stay away from Haruka, wondering why someone normal like Riki would want to approach her twin.\nSource: Wikipedia",
