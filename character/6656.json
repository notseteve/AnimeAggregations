  "description" : "The Radish is one of the handful of Irish-class battleships which spearhead the AEUG`s space fleets. A development of the Argama, the Irish class is a more straightforward design with a greater emphasis on firepower. The jade-green Radish, commanded by former Argama captain Henken Bekkener, enjoys a status within the rebel fleet second only to the flagship Argama itself, and the two ships are often deployed together on particularly urgent missions. The Radish also serves as Quattro Bajeena`s base of operations when he`s away from the Argama.",
