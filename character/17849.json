  "description" : "Victor Sinclair, a character created for the anime adaptation, is Winner`s grandfather. Disgusted by his ancestor`s seduction, which he blames it for his family`s exile from society, he holds a strong grudge against all vampires, particularly the Markers. An expert hunter and skilled fighter, his goal is to rid the world of the Markers and erase his family`s shame. Though he recognizes that Winner only achieves his goal of becoming a vampire hunter, he has not forgotten that she did so by biting him. At the end of the anime it is shown in a very decisive manner, however, that this `goal` is born of delusion and general unhappiness with his life and possibly his harsh perceived destiny. Once a creative solution is applied to Victor`s inner problems, he displays a much kinder personality. In the anime television series, Victor Sinclair is voiced by Katsumi Chou.\nSource: wiki",
