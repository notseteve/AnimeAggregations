  "description" : "Having originally been a civilian passenger transport, the Jotunheim was drafted by the Zeon principality as an evaluation support ship. It had been unarmed until it was refitted with a mega particle cannon and four dual machine guns. Even so, it is only used for management of new weapons and collecting data as its mobility and defense are below average.",
