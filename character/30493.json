  "description" : "Ash`s Sewaddle evolved into Ash`s Swadloon during his gym battle with Burgh. Ash`s Sewaddle managed to fend off a crushing blow from Burgh`s Whirlipede SolarBeam and evolved right after the attack finished. The battle quickly changed due to the evolution as Ash`s Swadloon`s Energy Ball, which it had just learned, was a useful attack allowing it to defeat Burgh`s Whirlipede.\nAsh`s Swadloon then faced Burgh`s Leavanny but it did not fair as well. After Burgh`s Leavanny used String Shot to tie Ash`s Swadloon up, Ash`s Swadloon was forced to use Razor Leaf on itself to break free which dealt significant damage. Ash`s Swadloon was defeated by Burgh`s Leavanny`s Hyper Beam shortly thereafter.",
