  "description" : "One of the Gundam mobile suits possessed by Celestial Being. Like the other Gundams, the Virtue is equipped with a GN Drive that gives it almost limitless energy. This heavily armed Gundam is equipped with a powerful GN Bazooka and movable GN Cannons, and can protect itself by generating a GN Field barrier. Its mobility is low compared to the other Gundams, but the Virtue`s tremendous firepower is highly effective in fleet battles and attacks on enemy bases. As its weapons and field generators consume large amounts of energy, the Virtue must often pause to replenish its supply of GN particles.",
