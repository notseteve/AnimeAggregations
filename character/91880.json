  "description" : "Locus the \"Moonlight Knight\" is an apostle who serves together with http://anidb.net/ch2009 [Zodd], http://anidb.net/ch91874 [Grunbeld], http://anidb.net/ch91878 [Irvine] and http://anidb.net/ch91872 [Rakshas] under the reborn http://anidb.net/ch91874 [Griffith] in his Band of the Hawk as a general and captain of the lancers.\nLocus generally appears incredibly calm and relaxed, shifting to a focused state-of-mind when in battle. He is calculated and strategic, being able to stay alive during his battle with Emperor Ganishka. Locus also displays a sense of wisdom that is rare among apostles, as he is able to see the advantages of capturing enemy troops and re-purposing them as a part of Griffith`s army. He also believes that every warrior is equal to each other, following the logic that just because they fight for the opposite beliefs doesn`t make that person his enemy, per se.\nUntil he swore loyalty to Griffith after seeing a vision of him prior, Locus was known to have been too prideful to submit to anybody. Since then, he has placed his absolute faith in Griffith, believing wholeheartedly that his leader`s actions are for the sake of the world.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
