  "description" : "Morana`s Abomasnow was first seen stirring up trouble when Cilan`s Pansage tried to share some fruit with it but threw a punch at it instead. Morana said that it was punishment for approaching her Yukinooh so carelessly but Cilan`s Pansage was trying to be kind and wanted to share.\nYukinooh`s Ability is Snow Warning but despite the type disadvantage, Cilan`s Pansage`s sense of unity with Cilan proved to be the deciding factor in the match. Morana`s Abomasnow lost the match against Cilan`s Pansage but Morana vowed that the next time they met, she`d make sure to win.",
