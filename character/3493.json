  "description" : "First mistaken for a witch whose soul Maka and Soul tried to take. It turned out that Blair is just a cat with strong magical powers. She was supposed to be the final soul Maka and Soul needed to make Soul a Death Scythe but since Blair was not a witch, they only took one of her nine \"lives\". This meant that Maka and Soul had to start all over again from zero souls. Blair moved in with Maka and Soul for no apparent reason after they took one of her lives. Maka and Soul, as well as their friends, have quietly accepted her into their lives. Blair has taken up a part-time job in the Chuppa-cabras night club, where she often drinks with Maka`s dad.",
