  "description" : "The Citroid is an artificial life form created by Clemont. Clemont was so busy as a Gym Leader that he barely had any time for my beloved inventions. That`s when he got the idea of making a capable Gym Leader Robot that could help him with his Gym matches. It is currently the interim Gym Leader of the Lumiose Gym.\nThe name Citroid is a combination of Citron and Android.\nClemont initially incorporated his image of an ideal Gym Leader into the AI but it later proved to be too strict as it required challengers to have at least 4 gym badges. Clemont did a few tweaks to change its software to give it a more modest attitude, that the number of badges a Trainer has is irrelevant, added kindness to its strictness, to never forget to give advice to the challenger after the battle and finally compassion.\nIt has a Master Recognition Battle mode which requires an voice activation code in order to initiate the mode. During the initial setup, the Citroid was damaged and instead of Clemont having the code set as \"Croquette\" it set the password as \"Please bear with me from today on. I`m Citron, the Gym Leader!\". This caused Clemont a lot of problems as he couldn`t initiate the Master Recognition Battle mode properly. He finally figured out what happened as was able to initiate the code to do the battle to prove that he was Clemont.",
