  "description" : "July is a young child most often seen being led around by April. He is a Doll whose observation powers rely on glass as a medium. He considers November and April to be his friends, a fact that initially astonishes Misaki and November as dolls are not supposed to think outside of their programming. April and July frequent November 11`s roadside site of death with offers of a bouquet or cigarettes and a beer or two. In the third episode of the 2nd season, July assists Suou by helping her direct her new-found powers against the FSB and the MIAC, and later joins up with Hei`s group, although his motivations for joining them remains unclear. However, it is implied later on that he has fallen in love with Suou. After he and Suou are killed by Izanami, they are both seen in the alternate world Shion created, with July being a normal boy instead of a doll.",
