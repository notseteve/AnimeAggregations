  "description" : "The jovial Ryu, a Federation Forces pilot trainee, is one of the only survivors of the White Base`s original crew. Ryu`s combination of good humour and military background lets him intercede between uptight captain Bright and the ship`s civilian pilots. Despite his training, Ryu is a fairly reckless pilot, often rushing into the middle of battle in a puny Core Fighter in an attempt to help out his fellow pilots.",
