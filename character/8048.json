  "description" : "An android with incredible power, J was created in cooperation between a government facility and a civilian enterprise; androids are illegal in Judoh, but a special exception is made for J, much to the dismay of wary city officials. Despite his hulking size, J can run at enormous speeds and packs a powerful punch. However, after prolonged bouts of action, J must cool himself down by venting a great deal of superheated air from pipes mounted on his shoulders, making a sound like a howling wolf.\nJ is maintained by the Civilian Enterprises Sect technician Antonia Bellucci. It is said that J is modeled after Antonia`s father. This is probably why J seems to be so human sometimes, with a noble character and strong beliefs on things like how a man should act.",
