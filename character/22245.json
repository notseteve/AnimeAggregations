  "description" : "The Saviour Gundam is a prototype mobile suit created by ZAFT as part of its Second Stage series. This transformable machine is designed for aerial combat, and it can change into a mobile armor form to carry out high-speed hit-and-run attacks using its powerful beam cannons. Because its development has fallen behind that of the other Second Stage machines, the Saviour escapes capture at Armory One, and Chairman Durandal subsequently offers it to the former Justice Gundam pilot Athrun Zala.",
