  "description" : "Heidayu was a member of Kagetomo`s ninja corps and he pledged eternal loyalty to him. While the rest of the ninja corps captured Hanzo from the ninja village, he stalled and bought enough time for them to complete that task.\nWhen the people from the Ninja Village came to rescue Hanzo, Heidayu battled against Ash and Sanpei. He lead for most the battle until Ash`s Frogadier evolved into Ash`s Greninja and became much stronger.\nIppei defeated Kagetomo in a Pok√©mon battle and as a result, Kagetomo realized he wasn`t strong enough yet but he also had a change of heart. He wanted to reconsider and rediscipline himself as he couldn`t get Hanzo`s words out of his head about use his powers for the sake of others. He then said he wanted to see what society is striving for. Heidayu said he`d follow Kagetomo anywhere.",
