  "description" : "Radolf Schneizen is a cardinal in the Elemia Church. He has looked after Aurica for some time. He is also a Reyvatiel supporter, unlike many other characters in the game. He is a very serious man, but he also is very stubborn and will not take back the words that he says easily. He fights using a Grathnode-enhanced spear. Radolf also used to have a partner Reyvateil and lover called Fayma, but he was separated from her once he reached the Cardinal rank.",
