He managed to make it back to dry land but Mareanie was still attached to the helmet. After a battle with Pikachu which they actually won, Mareanie continued to follow James and he decided to capture it.\nIt likes jumping on James`s head and poisoning him because it makes him look like a Mareanie and more specifically he then resembles James`s Mareanie first love.",
