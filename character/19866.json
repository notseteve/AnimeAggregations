Years prior to the 2nd War, she met and saved Marco, a man of the then-dispersed Chess Pieces. The two eventually fell in love with each other and one day, held their wedding in a small church. However, in the middle of the ceremony tragedy befell: when Eileen and Marco finished exchanging wedding vows and rings and were about to kiss, they were interrupted by a hostile group of villagers. The mob, who were Chess victims still living in vestiges of the war, were on a witch-hunt for the Chess and knowing Marco`s former affiliation, took him captive. For she loved him despite this, Eileen desperately beseeched for her fianc√©`s life, protesting Marco had already defected from his organization, and that the war was already over. In response, a representative man of the group told her as long as a Chess was still alive, the war would not end.",
