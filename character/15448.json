  "description" : "The younger sister of Reishirou. She is also part of the First Student Council, but is unable to see Aine or Asura Machina as she is not directly involved with them. She has a good relationship with Aine before she became a Burial Doll, and was glad that Aine was happy being with her brother. She appears to have a crush on Tomoharu, as she blushes when he is around and wore her hair in a manner that Tomoharu complimented (although she refuses to admit this).",
