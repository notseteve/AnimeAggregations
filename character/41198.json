  "description" : "Simon was caught in a thunderstorm and a tornado was approaching him as he watched in the field. Simon`s dad quickly picked him up and threw him in a storm celler and told him not to come out as he was going to check on the neighbors. Scared and wishing for his dad, Simon heard Pok√©mon voices and he could understand them. When the storm was over, people came to get him but the farm was destroyed. It is unknown if Simon`s Father died in the storm or not.",
