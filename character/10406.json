  "description" : "Lan Fan is a retainer of the Xing Empire`s Yao Clan, a personal bodyguard of http://anidb.net/ch10402 [Prince Ling] and the granddaughter of Ling`s other bodyguard, http://anidb.net/ch10405 [Fuu]. Fiercely loyal to her prince, Lan Fan`s devotion to Ling borders on romantic infatuation, as insults to his name cause her to fly into a rage (overwhelming her better judgment and dulling her usually sharp combat abilities) and she becomes flustered when unmasked in his presence.",
