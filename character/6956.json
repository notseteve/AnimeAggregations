  "description" : "Lind is a first class goddess of the special duty category, a Valkyrie.\nIt`s said that she`s the most extreme goddess because of the intense training she went through by herself.\nOther names of her are \"The Fighting Wing\" (戦う翼, Tatakau Tsubasa) and \"One-Winged Angel\" (片よくな天使, Katayoku na Tenshi). The latter name derives from the fact that her angel has only one wing.\nLind has a third name due to her being special in some way but that`s something you can find out yourself by watching http://anidb.net/a5426 [Aa! Megami-sama: Tatakau Tsubasa].",
