  "description" : "The Company contains thousands of elemental users, and most are hostile. They wish to bring complete destruction to those who dwell on the surface. Their hatred for the surface world stems from the belief that they were abandoned by them, which really isn`t true since only the scientists actually knew of their existence underground. They are also the people who want to awaken the dragons (called \"ron\") to complete their revenge and are willing to sacrifice Ruri to accomplish their goal. Chelsea and Sheille both turn against the company in order to get Ruri (maiden of life) to safety and away from the company.",
