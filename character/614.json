  "description" : "Wobbuffet is a stiff, blue, balloon-shaped Pokémon based on the late Japanese comedian Sanpei Hayashiya (林家三平) (1925-1980). Hayashiya`s trademark routine involved him putting one hand to his forehead and saying \"Sou nansu, okusan\" (そうなんす, 奥さん) (\"So it seems, madam\"). This is why, in the Japanese Pokémon anime and movies, Wobbuffet is often seen putting a hand to its forehead and shouting \"Soooooonansu!\" (which was translated as well for the English adaptation, where it indeed says \"Woooooobbuffet!\"). It is voiced by Kayzie Rogers.\nWobbuffet hates light and shock, so it lives in the quiet darkness of caves and only comes out at night. If attacked, it inflates its body to bolster its amazing ability to counter-attack using the moves Counter and Mirror Coat, rather than offensive battling like most other Pokémon, for it won`t attack on its own. It does nothing but endure attacks in this fashion, suggesting that Wobbuffet either has an inability to tolerate aggressive behavior on its part, or that it is simply built to withstand attacks. However, it will not endure an attack on its valued, sensitive tail. When that happens, the Pokémon will try to take the foe with it using Destiny Bond. To keep its pitch-black tail hidden from the sight of potential attackers, it lives in black caves and atmospheres as described above.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Jessie has owned a Wobbuffet ever since she accidentally exchanged her Lickitung for it in the episode Tricks Of The Trade. Wobbuffet is her equivalent of Misty`s Psyduck — it has a habit of popping out of its Pokéball at inopportune times without being called, including at the end of Team Rocket`s motto.",
