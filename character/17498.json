  "description" : "Michiko is the Onishi Office`s secretary but in effect serves as Oonishi`s personal assistant. She looks up to Oonishi and faithfully fulfills her responsibilities in an effort to repay his trust in her. Privately, she is Oonishi`s lover. Her existence seems to give brief moments of relief to Oonishi, who is constantly under great pressure both mentally and physically. Her gentle, \"straight-A-student\" appearance, however, could be deceiving. She is a full-fledged member of the Organo and thus not just a pretty face in the office.",
