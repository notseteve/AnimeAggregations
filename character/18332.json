  "description" : "Ten`i, a girl encountered by Kan`u`s group working as a chef at a tavern in the Gi kingdom in Shin Koihime Musou. Sousou learned about her when Rinrin accidentally blurted out liking Teni`s food better, so Sousou gave her a test to compare her cooking skills against her own. Sousou was not so impressed at first, until Kan`u`s group noticed Teni prepared the dishes with food they liked at her tavern, and Sousou conceeded defeat. Then when a raging bull crashed the scene, Teni surprised eveyone with her immense strength when she literally grabbed the bull by the horns and hurled it out of Sousou`s palace, earning her an invitation to join Sousou`s army.",
