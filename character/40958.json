  "description" : "Also known as Lord Mathias or Mathias-sama, he is the Leader of the Religious Organization which supports the Knights of the Silver Tree.\nIt is also revealed that he is a fake Leader that was only chosen for his exceptional memory, because a new true leader hadn`t been born at the time that the previous leader died.\nThe Organization is trying to kill him so that René can take the title, but in Season 2`s episode 5, he kills the High Elder. He places an Artifact chip created by Erenfried on his neck to receive powers. Due to the chip, half of Mathias is his own self, half is controlled by the chip (therefore by Thanatos).\nIn season 2, he was killed by Nyx/Erebos when trying to protect René.\nSource: Wiki",
