  "description" : "Migeira is not featured in the manga. His weapon, one of the Five Muramasas, is a 5-barreled gun called the Hashagou that he wears on his right arm. Its ammunition seems to be his soul or spiritual power. Migeira says that the first Muramasa was taken to China, and changed by Western alchemists into the form of a gun that he later tracked down. He also has the ability to see \"the future\" (or more correctly, the proper timeline that historically \"should\" have happened) and belongs to Kyou no Miyako, a secret order dedicated to governing the path of history. Because Kyou inhabits a body with two souls, this has caused a disturbance in the time line that Migeira seeks to rectify. He seems nonchalant most of the time, but sometimes gives wise advice to the characters or speaks passionately about his own sense of justice.",
