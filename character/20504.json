  "description" : "Alice is another anime-only character, and is a member of the Uzuki clan, which is associated with the rabbit of the Chinese Zodiac; she has a unique `bunny ear` hairstyle when she dons her combat gear. While the Uzuki clan is heavily involved with assassinations and Alice is considered one of their best, she breaks away from her family and goes on the run, aspiring to becoming a successful musician. Eventually, Alice meets and befriends Saigou, leaving her open to blackmail from her own clan. She receives the order to either kill Koushi or be responsible for Saigou`s death. After nearly succeeding in the deed, Alice is stopped by Saigou, who tells her - through interpreter Momoko - that her hands were made to create music, not shed blood. Thanks to the other young martial artists` intervention, Alice finally manages to leave her clan behind and goes to France to study music.",
