  "description" : "Oluolu`s Snorlax is a Pok√©base player who is currently busy playing the game in the pro league as a member of the Koikings team.\nDuring the match verses Team Rocket, the strategy of Team Rocket was to always hit the ball towards Oluolu`s Snorlax because it was always sleeping even during the game and it appeared to be very slow. That strategy seemed to work as Team Rocket scored a lot of runs during the game and the ball would bounce off of Snorlax`s stomach and onto the field. In the bottom of the 9th, the ball hit his bat and it used the Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake to quickly run around the bases and flatten Wobbuffet to score the game winning run at home plate.",
