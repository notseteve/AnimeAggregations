  "description" : "Fuurinji Hayato is Miu`s grandfather and the undefeated elder of the Ryouzanpaku Dojo, who is said to have beaten 500 Shaolin masters to near death. He is also known as the `Invincible Super Man` (無敵超人, Muteki Choujin, lit. \"man with no equals\"). His kicks have speeds that are still a blur even when viewing a replay of it at 1/1000 of the normal speed. If necessary, he is able to intimidate the other masters in order to maintain peace. Even using just 0.0002% of his power, he can easily overwhelm both Ken`ichi and Miu at the same time and rip a tree in half.",
