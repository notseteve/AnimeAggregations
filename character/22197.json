  "description" : "This is another model of land battleship used by Andrew Waltfeld`s forces. Like the Lesseps, these vessels use scale motors to travel through the desert sands, but they`re smaller and less heavily armed than Waltfeld`s flagship. Waltfeld deploys two such ships, the Petrie and the Henry Carter (both named after prominent Egyptologists), against the Archangel and its Desert Dawn allies.",
