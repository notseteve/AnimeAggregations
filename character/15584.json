  "description" : "An 800 year old Old Blood born in Poland on April 1 called Red-eye Zelman, and is the bearer of the god`s flame and a legend of the Dark Ages. Zelman has many other titles including the ancient dark hunter, the follower of the Fire God, the red-eyed murderer, and the prince with blood-colored eyes. He is also one of the rulers of the Special Zone. He comes from a glorious bloodline linking to the great warrior, Asura and is noted to be one of the last of that bloodline.\nHaving inherited the special blood of War God Asura, Zelman has a power called Eye Ignite, which enables him to create and control fire.\nZelman Clock has a slightly wild sense of charisma, but his real self is someone with no morality and is a complete sociopath. Even so, despite his hatred and strong emotions, he is someone who values, above all, freedom and lives only according to his existence as a vampire. He taught Kotaro that a vampire`s fate centers around blood and blood only. Also, before his confrontation with Jiro, despite his sense of anticipation of the confrontation, Zelman is able to hide it and keep it under control. He is the only one of the vampire leaders who willingly accepted Jiro and his brother to the Special Zone as he enjoys their personalities.\nHe is a leader of the non-officially-sanctioned group called The Coven. Because he had to prove his bloodline, and had to go through a fight, he was the only one that was left; which is also due to his lifespan of 800 years.",
