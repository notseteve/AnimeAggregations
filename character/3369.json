Despite this, she attends Midori Middle School, one of the toughest elite schools to get into in the area. She initially adores Reborn, but after she is saved from drowning by Tsuna, she diverted her adoration towards him instead. She loves and is overprotective of children and is usually the one to babysit Lambo and I-Pin with Kyoko.",
