  "description" : "As the daughter of Ian, she was part of Celestial Being by default and learned much about engineering, GN Technology, and programming while growing up, and now joins the crew of the Ptolemaios. Normally at the operator`s chair but also a mechanic with the inherited knowledge and skill of her father. She brightens up her surroundings with her cheery expressions and behaviour; she particularly appears to enjoy asking others if they are lovers based on her \"maiden`s intuition.\" Her carefree behaviour even when the situation is bad constantly makes Ian angry and scolds her about it.",
