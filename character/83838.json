  "description" : "Sawyer`s Clawitzer was the second Pokémon sent out to battle in the first 2nd 3-on-3 battle of Ash vs Sawyer. It replaced Sawyer`s Doublade who was defeated by Ash`s Noivern.\nIt proved to be a very effective Pokémon in the match as it quickly finished off Ash`s Noivern and then faced off against Ash`s Hawlucha. Sawyer had already devised a tactic to defeat Hawlucha and he lured it high into the air and used the super effective Ice Beam against it to 1-hit KO it. Ash`s Greninja then entered the match and with its first attack, it knocked out Sawyer`s Clawitzer.",
