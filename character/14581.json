  "description" : "Ruby Moon is one of two magical guardians created by Eriol. The counterpart to the original guardian Yue, Ruby Moon is genderless but prefers to act as a female. When Eriol transfers to Tomoeda Elementary, Ruby Moon created a false form named Akizuki Nakuru and enrolls in Seijou High School, entering the same class as Touya, Sakura`s brother, and Yukito, the false form of Yue who is unaware of his true nature. As Akizuki, she acts as a general annoyance, deliberately interfering every time Touya tries to talk to Yukito about the latter`s dwindling energy. She claims she wants to consume Touya`s energy herself, though it is never stated that she actually has a need for it nor why she couldn`t simply steal it. When Touya is finally able to speak with Yue and give him all of his magical energy to sustain Yue`s life, Akizuki gives up her pursuit. In the final battle, Ruby Moon battles Yue and initially appears to be winning. However, Yue is able to get past her due to his greater determination and desire to protect Sakura.",
