Her grandfather, a former nobleman who became a knight was one of the founders of the Independent Trade Cities during the Valbanil War which since then, the Cambell family have served as knights protecting the city`s independence. When her father died of an illness, Cecily took up the role of the head of house, and thus became a knight.\nWhen the anime begins, she is portrayed as inadequate and doesn`t fight well. Cecily later improves significantly. However, the manga and light novels depict her as a strong, smart girl with great leadership skills; the viewers are shown this in an early chapter when she leads a group of knights and mercenaries against a band of thieves and monsters. This version of Cecily learns from her mistakes quickly and is a skilled sword fighter. In both versions, she is prideful person and takes offense of any negative remark from Luke. As the series progresses, she develops romantic feelings toward Luke.",
