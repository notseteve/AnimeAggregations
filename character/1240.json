  "description" : "Carnivine resemble venus fly traps; in fact, the Japanese name for this Pokémon is derived from the scientific name of the plant. Capable of levitation, it attracts its prey with its sweet-smelling saliva, then chomps down. It takes a whole day to eat its prey. Its diet consists chiefly of bugs (presumably weak ones, as ironically, Bug-type attacks are super effective against Carnivine).The only place Carnivine is obtainable is in the Great Marsh in Pastoria City.\nIn the Anime, James from Team Rocket has a Carnivine who always bites his head. This Carnivine is one of James` childhood Pokémon friends whose Poké Ball was hidden inside a box of bottle caps at his family`s cottage in the Sinnoh Region. James found it after years of separation. Like James` two Pokémon before it, Carnivine has a tendency to affectionately attack James when released from its Poké Ball. This follows the pattern of his earlier Grass-Type Pokémon, Victreebel and Cacnea, who used to attack him.",
