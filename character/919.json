  "description" : "Ludicolo is the final evolved form of the Lotad species line. Ludicolo is a large, bipedal creature with a duck-like mouth on its body which looks like a pineapple, and the lilypad on its head carried over from its previous stages of Pokémon evolution resembles a sombrero hat, and pancho-colored plumage. Ludicolo can derive much energy and vitality from cheerful and upbeat music. Upon hearing such music, for example during festivities or mountain hiking expeditions, Ludicolo is driven into the open and starts dancing rhythmically. The principle behind this phenomenon is that the melodious sound waves are supposed to stimulate Ludicolo`s cells into making it more powerful.\nIn the Pokémon anime, the Lombre in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Ludicolo. Like many of the Ludicolo species, Brock`s Ludicolo is very cheerful and is frequently seen dancing joyfully around.",
