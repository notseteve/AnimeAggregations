  "description" : "The QF-2001 is an unmanned stealth fighter produced before the United Nations Wars began in 2000. As a predecessor to the http://anidb.net/ch48793 [QF-3000E] used in Space War I (circa 2009) and the http://anidb.net/ch48628 [Ghost X-9] (circa 2040) the QF-2001 Ghost pioneered many of the conventional technologies for modern unmanned stealth fighters. The Ghost`s large single engine, low mass and upward-canted forward-swept cranked gull wing makes the unmanned fighter very fast and agile. The armament of the QF-2001 Ghost remains classified however, observers have noted two open ports on the forward ventral hull along side the forward landing gear as well as four closed ports that resemble micro-missile launcher doors on either side of the rear ventral fuselage. QF-2001 Ghost fighters were depoyed aboard the http://anidb.net/ch50482 [CVN-99 Asuka II] during the events surrounding the island of Mayan in 2008.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/qf-2001-ghost.htm",
