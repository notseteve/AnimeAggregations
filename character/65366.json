  "description" : "The old woman from Kalos lives with her husband near Shoyo City. She enjoys cooking, especially macarons. Her husband had been battling with her for a long time but the day before Clemont and his friends met him, the two of them had got into an argument and neither wanted to apologize.\nClemont`s Chespin could smell the macarons she was cooking that day and quickly followed the smell to her house. The two of them became friends quickly. Wanting to knock her husbands down a peg, she agreed to battle him with her secret weapon, Clemont`s Chespin in a Pokémon battle. The old man agreed but with the stipulation that she would forgive him for what he said the day before. Clemont`s Chespin was too fat to battle though as it had been eating too many macarons. Clemont ended up intervening and got it to rull to reduce its belly fat. The match had to be called as the old man`s back gave out as he was trying to command Mafoxy to use Mystical Fire.\nThe old man returned to his house and had bought his wife a cake as make-up gift. He had planned to apologize, no matter if he won or lost the Pokémon battle between them.",
