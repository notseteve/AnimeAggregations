  "description" : "Jinnai is a low-ranked homunculus in the LXE who, like Kinjo, is sent to spy on Papillon. When Kinjo fails to kill the Alchemy Warriors, Jinnai kills Kinjo to prevent him from talking, then later that night uses his Buso Renkin, Noisy Hamelin, to control the students at the Ginsei High dorm to try to take Kakugane LII from Tokiko. He retreats after being injured by Tokiko, then attempts to eat Chisato in her dorm room, but Tokiko forces him out into the forest where she cuts off his arms and legs with her Valkyrie Skirt. After he promises to tell her about the LXE, Tokiko returned his severed limbs, but deliberately attaches his arms and legs to the wrong places. Angered by this, he attacks Tokiko again and she kills him. According to Watsuki, he based Jinnai on the character Otowa Hyoko from Rurouni Kenshin.",
