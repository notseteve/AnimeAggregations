  "description" : "Nezumi Otoko is a rodent-like youkai-human halfbreed. He has been alive for three hundred and sixty years, and in that time has almost never taken a bath, rendering him filthy, foul-smelling, and covered in welts and sores. While he is usually Kitarou`s friend, Nezumi Otoko will waste no time cooking up vile schemes or betraying his companions if he thinks there`s money to be had or a powerful enemy to side with. He claims to be a college graduate of the University of the Bizarre (怪奇大学, Kaiki Daigaku).\nNezumi-Otoko first appears in the story The Lodging House (Rental manga version) as Dracula IV`s minion.",
