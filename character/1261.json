  "description" : "Mamoswine, known as the Twin Tusk Pokémon, resembles a cross between a pig and a woolly mammoth. Mamoswine`s name is derived from the words mammoth and swine. The tusks are much larger than those of Piloswine and seem to be shifted downward. The tusks of the male are larger than those of the female. The tusks are made from solid ice instead of dentin like most teeth are. Mamoswine were common around the Ice Age but their numbers dwindled as the climate warmed up. It is the evolution of Piloswine from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl onwards. It evolves when Piloswine is leveled up while knowing the move Ancient Power. In order to teach it this move, the player must dig up a Heart Scale in the underground, give it to the Move Maniac in Pastoria City and request Ancient Power from the list of past learned moves. However, Ancient Power is also an egg move for Swinub.",
