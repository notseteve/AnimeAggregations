  "description" : "Gothorita lives with Yuto on Milos Island in the Unova region and is one of his partners. Yuto explained to Ash and his friends that according to the Milos Island legend, the Pokémon which helped Landlos was a Gothimiru. Yuto`s Gothorita was out looking for a Revival Herb for Yuto as normally Yuto`s Lilligant would do the searching but it was ill at the time. Yuto introduced Ash and his friends and Yuto`s Gothorita grew fond of Iris`s Axew.\nRainmaking Ritual\nYuto knew the rainmaking ritual that was supposed to produce rain on Milos Island. He took bundles of grass to Landlos` shrine and lined them up. He lit the grass with two rocks and he explained to everyone that once the grass was burning, they`d tell Landlos their feelings through Yuto`s Gothorita so Landlos would bless them with rain on Milos Island so the land would be fertile again and the Revival Herbs would grow. The ritual that Yuto`s Gothorita helped performed seemed to work until Tornelos interfered with it.\nMedium Ritual\nYuto`s Gothorita also played a large role in the Medium Ritual as it was able to use its powers to convey Iris` feelings to Landlos to summon it.\nIt tried to help out battling against the legendary Pokémon Tornelos and Voltolos but its attacks weren`t powerful enough to do any damage to them. It was able to give the Revival Herb to Landlos to heal it just like the legend of Milos Island said and Yuto`s Gothorita was the one who lent power to it.",
