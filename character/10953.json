  "description" : "Gaia, Ortega, and Mash, a trio better known as the \"Black Tri-Stars,\" are perhaps Zeon`s most famous ace pilots after \"Red Comet\" Char Aznable. During the Battle of Loum, they used their famous jetstream attack manoeuvre to capture the Federation`s General Revil. On the eve of Operation Odessa, they`re transferred to Earth to shore up M`quve`s defences, and now the White Base and its pilots will experience the jetstream attack first-hand.",
