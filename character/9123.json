  "description" : "The \"crow princess\". A humanoid female from an alien race of crow tengu, she is destined to mate with the man that awakens her from her slumber with a kiss. Unfortunately for her, that person turns out to be Ataru. Although she has no real desire to sleep with him, for the sake of her race, she goes to great lengths in an attempt to turn the perverted letch into a man worthy of fathering her children while fighting off both Lum and Shinobu. Her father, apparently, was Yoshitsune Minamoto, one of the legendary figures of Japanese history, whom Kurama considers to be her ideal man. Future efforts to find a husband also failed due to some kind of flaw. Mendou was too similar to Ataru, Ryuunosuke was actually a girl, and Rei turned into a hideous ushitora creature. It did not help matters that all of the individuals she sought out to be her mate happened to live in the same area as Ataru, who still believed himself to be the one to father her children.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
