  "description" : "As Masami Kurumada uses the revered Osamu Tezuka`s Star System, (A stable cast of characters which play a different or similar role in the author`s various works, sometimes with the same personality and sometimes with an entirely new one), he designed Aiolia`s appearance very similar to Zaji, the main character in Raimei no Zaji, a manga that Kurumada wrote and drew years before Saint Seiya.\nIn his manga, Kurumada gave Aiolia blonde hair. In the anime adaptation, due to a relative excess of yellow tones in Kurumada`s design, Aiolia`s hair color was modified to light brown to achieve a better color balance and contrast.",
