  "description" : "Kirigaya Kazuto, who uses the portmanteau \"Kirito\" as his character name, is a \"solo\" player who has been branded a \"beater\" (a combination of beta tester and cheater) by the players in Sword Art Online. When Kayaba announces that the players of Sword Art Online can no longer log-out without clearing the game, he quickly overcomes the shock. He power-levels to improve his odds of survival in the game, and emerges as a frontline floor-clearer known as the Black Swordsman. In SAO, he is the sole «Dual Blades» skill user. During his time in SAO, he falls in love with a female player, Asuna, and even marries her in-game.\nSource: Wiki",
