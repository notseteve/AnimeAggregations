He says that he was originally bisexual, but became homosexual after his wife`s death because he could never love another woman. In contrast to Haruhi`s practicality and lack of interest in material things, he is rather bad with money, and buys girly clothing for Haruhi in the hopes of getting her to dress more cutely.",
