  "description" : "The unified world government that launched the space settlement program and now rules over both Earth and the space colonies. Its main decision-making body is the Earth Federation Assembly, which meets occasionally to pass new legislation.\nThough not as cruel and aggressive as the Principality of Zeon`s leaders, the bureaucrats who rule over the Earth Federation are corrupt, weak-willed, and insensitive to the space colonists` desire for independence. After the One Year War, the Federation decides to concentrate its energies on reconstructing Earth instead of the space colonies, further increasing political tensions.",
