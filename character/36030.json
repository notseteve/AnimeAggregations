  "description" : "Ooshima Genzou became President of Yamato Constructions after retiring from the Ministry of Construction. Using his bureaucratic connections, he pushed Yamato Constructions into profitability by snagging lucrative government contracts. His hidden agenda, though, was to take over Yamato Constructions by acquiring shares through various fronts. This share acquisition was funded by illegally siphoning money from Yamato itself. His plans came to naught, and he was dismissed as President at the board meeting where he intended to dismiss Yamato Morinosuke as Chairman.",
