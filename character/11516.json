  "description" : "She is a bourgeois-only child. She loves women regardless of age. In regards to coming in late, sleeping in class, generally being a delinquent and failing grades, she is ahead of the curve. However, it seems that she used to be a perfect student straight out of some movie. Although Shinobu is involved in a harem with most of her classmates, she is in love with Momoko Naitou the most.",
