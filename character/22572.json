  "description" : "Mandi`s Exeggutor is the Pokémon Mandi decided to use first against Ash in the first round of the Kanto Pokémon League.\nExeggutor was up against Ash`s Krabby and started off well as its Psybeam to force Krabby to jump into the water. Then, using its Psychic ability, Exeggutor created a whirlpool in the water, trapping Krabby inside. As Krabby struggled to get out of the whirlpool Exeggutor started to bombard the pool using its egg-bomb attack that made Ash attempt to switch Krabby out, although unsuccessful due to the whirlpool trapping Krabby inside.\nA smug Mandi was caught off-guard when Krabby managed to compose itself, launch out of the water and used Vicegrip on Exeggutor`s leaf, clamping on hard as Exeggutor tried to shake it off. A quick leer attack, followed by a Stomp KO`ed Exeggutor and Krabby had won its first ever battle.\nMandi looked on as he watched Krabby evolve into Kingler but quickly regained his flair as he release his second Pokémon, a Seadra.",
