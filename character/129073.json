  "description" : "Jun Suzaki (洲崎 遵 Suzaki Jun), also known by his stage name \"ZACK\", is one of the guitarists of Fantôme Iris.\nWhile blessed with high sensibility and an astounding musical talent, he was born with a weak body that hindered him in doing most things. While usually a frail and timid child who shuts himself in his room to play games, he switches to ZACK onstage or in his games and gets his adrenaline pumping so much you`ll be hearing lots of censor beeps if ever he will be broadcasted on TV.\nHis ZACK persona is an abandoned vampire who was picked up by FELIX from the dredges of despair and neglect.",
