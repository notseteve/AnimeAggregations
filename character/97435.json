  "description" : "Nazami Enec was a member of the http://anidb.net/ch97462 [Four Imperial Knights] of the http://anidb.net/ch95432 [Baharuth Empire]. Like the other Four Imperial Knights he was selected by http://anidb.net/ch95433 [Jircniv] to be a member due to his skills rather than his background.\nWhen http://anidb.net/ch72784 [Mare] and http://anidb.net/ch72777 [Aura] visited the Imperial Palace to warn Jircniv, Nazami came out to confront the trespassers. Jircniv ordered http://anidb.net/ch95434 [Fluder] to tell Nazami to withdraw but Mare cracked the earth before he can be told to do so. Nazami was swallowed by the resulting earthquake along with several Royal Guards and subsequently killed by Mare`s spell.\nSource: Overlord Wiki",
