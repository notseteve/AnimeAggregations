  "description" : "Deino is a Pok√©mon characterised as being blind. Deino is based on a dragon, specifically an infant form of Yamata no Orochi. Its blindness and the fact that it is only found in the Victory Road cave may mean it suffers from subterranean blindness. Deino may also be partially based on various cave salamanders due to their blindness. It has four legs. Its skin color is blue, and a thick black fur covers most of its face and its neck. There are 6 purple spots in the fur, and the fur makes the shape of a horn on the top of its head. There is a short tail on its back. It likes to bite at anything that comes close due to the lack of their senses. It also can not aim due to the fur on its head covering its eyes obscuring its vision. Its primary habitat is caves with abundant water sources. Its name comes from dino & ein, which means \"one dinosaur\".",
