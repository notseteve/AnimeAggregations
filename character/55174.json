  "description" : "Knuckle Bine (ナックル=バイン) is a Beast Hunter and Morel`s pupil. Despite appearing to be an aggressive man, Knuckle is very compassionate and easily moved to tears. He also gets along well with animals, having the habit of taking care of abandoned pets. Knuckle`s Nen ability is Hakoware: Bankruptcy, Chapter Seven (天上不知唯我独損), where by lending some aura to his opponent via a punch, he attaches a small indestructible Nen-creature called Amortizing Power Redirector (ポットクリン) or A.P.R. for short. It follows the opponent wherever they go and grows each successive time Knuckle hits them and by 10% interest on the borrowed aura every ten seconds. The opponent pays Knuckle back by hitting him, but he will not take damage until the debt is fully paid, and if the aura count exceeds their total remaining aura, the opponent goes bankrupt. At this point A.P.R. transforms into Individual Ren Suppressor (トリタテン) or I.R.S. for short, which attaches itself and forces the debtor into Zetsu unable to use Nen for 30 days.\nSource: Wikipedia",
