  "description" : "Sugar is a female snow fairy in training, working to learn how to be a full fledged fairy. She comes to the human world for the final part of her training, requiring her to find a \"Twinkle\". Sugar acts much like a toddler, with a clumsy nature who often tries her best at things but messes them up because she doesn`t always think things through. She loves to kiss anyone she is fond of when happy. After Saga first feeds her a waffle, she comes to love treats, though she mispronounces their name as \"waffo\".",
