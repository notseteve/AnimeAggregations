  "description" : "Fuu is the leading lady of the show, a fifteen-year-old girl of samurai lineage, but brought up in poverty. After a not-so-successful stint as a tea house waitress, she saves Mugen and Jin from execution and recruits them as her bodyguards to help her on a quest. She is searching for the Samurai who smells of Sunflowers, but never explains what a sunflower smells like or what the man looks like. Mugen and Jin are often reminded of their life-debt to her when they wish to fight each other, much to their chagrin. Without her father around to support them, Fuu and her mother led a difficult life until her mother died of illness.",
