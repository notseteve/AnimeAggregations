  "description" : "Lawrence III is a Pokémon Collector who captured the three legendary bird Pokémon Moltres, Zapdos and Articuno in the Orange Archipelago. He began his collecting with an Ancient Mew card and legendary Pokémon were always his passion. His goal was to use the legendary birds to summon Lugia so he could capture it.\nHe was very familiar with the ancient legend regarding the Legendary birds which states: Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice or lightning, lest these titans wreak destruction upon the world in which they clash. Though the water`s great guardian shall arise to quell the fighting, alone its song will fail, and thus the earth shall turn to ash. O Chosen One, into thine hands bring together all three. Their powers combined tame the Beast of the Sea. He thought that he was the Chosen One when he read this legend.\nMoltres, Zapdos and Articuno all attacked his flying ship enough to disable it and cause it to crash but that did not stop Lawrence from attempting to still capture Lugia. Realizing that it would be captured, Lugia attacked his airship and destroyed the remains, thwarting Lawrence`s attempt to capture Lugia. Lawrence vowed to restart his Pokémon collection though after he picked up his Ancient Mew card off the ground near the ruble of his ship.\nIn the fifth Pokémon movie, Lawrence III appears in a book during the ending credits that Annie and Oakley were reading.",
