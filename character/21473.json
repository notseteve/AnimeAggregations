  "description" : "Extraordinarily skilled in air combat, and with stunning looks, she is an ultra ace called the \"Star of Africa\".\nWhen Marseille was young, her powers were too much for her to control, a trouble-causing problem child who clashed with those around her. But after meeting one teacher who changed her life, she set her sights on joining the air force.\nEven in the military she continued causing problems with her rowdy lifestyle, and her disregard for formation fighting led to her engaging enemies on her own. However, when serving in North Africa far from European civilization, she became much more composed, even aloof.\nShe is often regarded as humanity`s most skilled marksman, such is her skill that it almost appears as if her targets dive into her line of fire by themselves.\nHer victory count by `42 was over 100, but while the number of Neuroi appearing in Africa was relatively low, they were comparatively more threatening and even formidable Neuroi than those in European skies; thus her score is often said to have a value of two or three times higher.\nIn October 1942, during a fierce battle in a newly-arrived Striker, Marseille`s Eagle familiar \"died\" in a freak accident. Without the familiar`s magic support, the engine output could not be regulated, and the engine burst into flames, while Marseille was saved by her wingman and evacuated out of battle.\nMourning the death of her war companion and familiar, Marseille had a small pyramid-shaped grave marker constructed directly below the site of the battle.\nShe is named after Luftwaffe fighter pilot and flying ace Hans Joachim Marseille.",
