  "description" : "Kuro Sakura, more often called Dark Sakura, is a version of http://anidb.net/ch1905 [Matou Sakura] after being consumed by evil. Any further details are spoilers to the Heaven`s Feel route of the Fate/Stay Night visual novel and http://anidb.net/a10755 [its anime adaptation].\nIn Heaven`s Feel, it is revealed that Sakura is not biologically a member of the Matou family; as the Matou no longer had heirs capable of magecraft, http://anidb.net/ch37277 [Matou Zouken] took her for adoption. This is also referred to in http://anidb.net/a8160 [Fate/Zero].\nTo make Sakura compatible with his family`s magecraft, Zouken implants worms in her. To increase their efficiency, he regularly has her abused in several ways. Along with the worms he implanted in Sakura, he also placed fragments of the Holy Grail from the 4th Holy Grail War in her, in order to turn her into a version of the Holy Grail for his own use. In doing that, he places a link between her and the evils that reside in the Grail.\nThroughout the course of the 5th Holy Grail War, Zouken uses Sakura and http://anidb.net/ch37943 [his own Servant] to crush the enemy camps. Sakura absorbs not only several Servants but even innocent people; in the process, she also regurgitates the previously-absorbed http://anidb.net/ch38 [Saber] as http://anidb.net/ch37946 [Saber Alter]. As the story progresses, she quickly falls into despair, and eventually gives in to the evil in her. Upon doing so, she becomes Dark Sakura, a rage-driven version of Sakura that is only interested in bringing the evils in the world to life through the activation of the Holy Grail.",
