  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch6889 [Anthy]`s older Indian brother, the acting chairman of the academy, and the closest character to a main antagonist the series has.\nIn his youth, Akio and http://anidb.net/ch8696 [Dios] were apparently one and the same, but he became corrupted and lost his purpose as a \"prince\". Given the origin of his name and his role in the story, Akio may be compared to a fallen angel.\nIn order to regain the power he lost when he lost his nobility, he creates the Duelling Game in order to create a Duellist with a sword noble and powerful enough to break the Rose Gate sealing his lost power. In the film, \"Dios\" is merely an illusion created by Anthy to hide her brother`s flaws so she can have a hero to believe in.",
