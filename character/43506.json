  "description" : "Uvogin was one of the original members of the Troupe from Meteor City. Out of all of the Phantom Troupe, he was the strongest in terms of raw physical power. Uvogin was so strong, that direct hits from bullets, sniper bullets, and even anti-tank rockets don`t do visible damage to him. Like all of the Troupe, he never hesitates to kill, and particularly enjoys combat against skilled opponents. Although he prefers to fight alone, Uvogin becomes stronger when fighting with a partner, usually Nobunaga, because he fights better when there is someone else to protect (although he never admits this). Seeking revenge on Kurapika for capturing him after his battle with the Shadow Beasts, Uvogin tracks him to the hotel where Neon Nostrade and the rest of her bodyguards are staying. They fight one-on-one in a small canyon on the outskirts of Yorknew City. Kurapika eventually captures Uvogin with his Chain Jail, and questions him about the location and abilities of the other Phantom Troupe members. Uvogin refuses to answer any questions, responding only with \"Kill me.\" Kurapika then pierces Uvogin`s chest with the Judgement Chain ability, giving Uvogin the condition that he must answer all questions truthfully. Kurapika once again asks him the location of the other Troupe members, to which Uvogin only smiles and says to Kurapika \"Go to hell, you bastard.\" Kurapika`s Judgement Chain pierces Uvogin`s heart, instantly killing him. Uvogin is buried by Kurapika at the site of their battle. He was the eleventh member of the Troupe. Nen type: Enhancement\nSource: Wiki",
