  "description" : "Large-scale construction in space was just one of many new endeavors brought about by the development of OverTechnology. To assist in zero-g construction operations, the U.N. Spacy contracted equipment manufacturer Glamor to build a multi-purpose craft for use in space. The Glamor Spider Bug was developed to meet the needs of construction in space and to assist with any other general-purpose functions. With four large manipulator arms, a heavy-duty grasping claw and a large fuel tank, this one-man space craft was soon employed in hundreds of operations all throughout the Sol system. The U.N. Spacy often kept these units aboard many of their capital spaceships and a Glamor Spider Bug was seen inside the hangar of ARMD-01 when Space War I began in 2009.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/spiderbug.htm",
