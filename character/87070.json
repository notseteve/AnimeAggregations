  "description" : "Ash`s Rowlet was obtained in the forest near the Pokémon School on Melemele Island. It is an easygoing glutton that still exhibits incredible amounts of power when fighting for its friends. It enjoys roosting in Ash`s backpack and is often seen there while traveling.\nIt hatched from an egg with a group of Pikipek and despite the Pokémon type difference, it became a well liked family member of the nest which also included a Trumbeak and a Toucannon. It would often go on food scavenges with the flock at a certain time of the year. It had mistaken a wind chime for a berry and it had to go out again to find food but the second time it went out it mistook Mallow`s Bounsweet for food as well. Ash though took pity on it and gave it some food including a watermelon which Rowlet took back to the nest and was congratulated for bringing. Ash though wanted to catch the Rowlet, so he followed it back to the nest. When Ash decided that it should stay with its family in the nest instead of trying to catch it, Toucannon nudged Rowlet out, telling it to go with Ash. Moments later, it let itself be caught by the Poké Ball.",
