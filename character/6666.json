  "description" : "The Gabthley is a prototype transformable mobile suit designed by the brilliant Paptimus Scirocco. With its shoulder-mounted cannons and powerful fedayeen rifle, it excels at long-range bombardment, and its beam sabers and the grappling claws built into its legs make it dangerous in close combat as well. In its insect-like mobile armour form, the Gabthley exhibits remarkable agility thanks to its dozens of rocket engines and manoeuvring verniers, and this high-performance machine proves to be a worthy adversary for the AEUG`s Zeta Gundam.",
