  "description" : "Drasna`s Noivern was first seen by Ash Ketchum on television during an interview with Drasna when it was announced that she would face off against Ash Ketchum in a Pokémon World Championships Hyper Class battle. It made it`s first anime appearance briefly during the GOTCHA! music video.\n-- Pokémon World Championships Hyper Class Battle VS Ash --\nWhile at the Lumiose Gym for training, just before this match, it learned the move Meteor Assault. The first match up was Ash`s Sirfetch`d verses Drasna`s Noivern. Noivern controlled much of this battle as its Boomburst proved to be hard on Sirfetch`d. It initially blocked it with its shield but the audience had to cover their ears it was so loud and it caused the ground to rupture and a rock hit its shield and knocked it out of its grip. It then lost its leek as well, hampering its normal battle stance but it recovered them but had taken significant damage in the battle and was recalled for Ash`s Dracovish. Drasna ended up also recalling Noivern.\nDrasna`s Altaria battled Dracovish, and as it was nearing defeat, it was recalled and Ash`s Sirfetch`d used Meteor Assault to knock out Drasna`s Mega Altaria but it also was knocked out in the process. Sirfetch`d initially was going to rest in its Poké Ball, but it wanted to see the rest of the match from the sidelines. Dracovish then faced off against a weakened Noivern and the two clashed with Dragon Rush and Dragon Pulse and Ash`s Dracovish was the one left standing which gave Ash Ketchum the match victory.",
