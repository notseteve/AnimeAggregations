  "description" : "Cécile Croomy is Lloyd`s subordinate in Camelot and one of the Lancelot`s developers. She is a capable scientist in her own right, having designed the energy wing system used on the Guren Seiten and the Lancelot Albion. Cécile is a kind-hearted woman and a good friend to Suzaku, often helping him with homework. She also acts as Lloyd`s conscience, not hesitating to scold him or physically punish him for his unintentionally rude remarks or treating Suzaku as a \"part\". Cécile is a capable Knightmare Frame pilot, managing to single-handedly hold the entire contingent of Black Knights sent to occupy Ashford Academy during the Black Rebellion at bay using a Sutherland modified with equipment from the Lancelot. Prior to joining Lloyd in the military, she studied at the Imperial Colchester Institute.[4] Following Lelouch`s ascension to the throne, she follows Lloyd and Suzaku and willingly accepts Lelouch as the new emperor. A recurring joke is that Cécile is a bad cook, though no one has the heart to tell her; her recipes include onigiri mixed with blueberry jam and sandwiches made with ginger, sugar and wasabi.",
