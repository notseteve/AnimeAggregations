  "description" : "Chroniko is a girl Kaiba meets during a stop Neuron makes. She sells her body (literally) so that the money can support her family and hopes that someday her family will become wealthy enough to buy her a new body in the future. However, she is killed by a corrupt doctor (by simply releasing her mind from storage) as her family doesn`t have any intentions of keeping her, and her body is sold anyway. Before her body is taken by the buyer, Hyo-Hyo places Kaiba`s mind inside her body, and Kaiba uses this disguise to avoid capture and get back aboard Neuron.",
