  "description" : "Essentially the last in the \"Gaza\" line built by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War in U.C. 0088, the AMX-008 Ga-Zowmn is actually quite a radical departure from its AMX-003 Gaza-C and AMX-006 Gaza-D predecessors. The Ga-Zowmn is also a transformable unit, and both its mobile suit and mobile armor modes are armed with an improved hyper knuckle buster beam rifle and a pair of 9-tube launchers equipped with large missiles. The Ga-Zowmn is also armed with beam sabers and vulcan guns in its forearms for close-range and melee combat. However, its heavy firepower make this general purpose mobile suit more appropriately used as an offensive mobile suit. In U.C. 0096, the Ga-Zowmn remains in service with the \"Sleeves\" faction of Neo Zeon.\nSource: mahq.net",
