  "description" : "Shimazu Toyohisa is the main protagonist and leader of the http://anidb.net/ch86429 [Drifters]. Historically, he died in 1600 during the Battle of Sekigahara. When he first arrived in the new world, he was critically injured, only to be brought to http://anidb.net/ch79269 [Nobunaga] and http://anidb.net/ch79270 [Yoichi]`s hideout by the young elves, http://anidb.net/ch81509 [Marsha] and http://anidb.net/ch81508 [Mark].\nAlthough impulsive and reckless, Toyohisa possesses a fearless, determined, and chivalrous spirit, assisting the elves and dwarves by liberating them from the Orte Empire. Born and raised in a war-torn era, Toyohisa has a keen sense for battle and tactics, though he remains unaware of these talents himself. Toyohisa primarily uses a nodachi in battle, though he is seen carrying a wakizashi. He also carries a Tangeashima on the back of his waist, which he only uses when his swords are infeasible to use against his enemies.\nSource: Wikipedia",
