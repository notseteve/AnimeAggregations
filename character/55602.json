  "description" : "Chimera ants are species of insect, extremely dangerous and ranked first among insects that should be quarantined. They have voracious appetites and can consume several times their own weight within a single day. Chimera ant queens possess an entirely unique method of reproduction, known as phagogenesis, a fictional term describing the process by which chimera ants reproduceâ€”through eating. By eating other creatures, a chimera ant queen imparts the characteristics the ingested creatures onto the next generation of chimera ants it gives birth to. To take advantage of the genes of a particular species, chimera ants have been known to feed until the fodder species is driven to extinction. After tasting humans, the ants focus their efforts on gathering humans. This leads to them learning nen, which increases their strength, but also forms conflict, as their \"past memories\" as humans causes them to strive for individuality.",
