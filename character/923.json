  "description" : "Taillow is a common bird Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Its Japanese name comes from tsubame (swallow). It is a migratory bird that dislikes cold seasons. It migrates to other lands in search of warmth, flying over 180 miles a day on some occasions. It will courageously stand their ground against foes, taking on Pokémon like Skarmory with an equal footing. This gutsy Pokémon will remain defiant even after a loss. This however is in stark contrast to when it becomes hungry; it cries loudly. As a result of its relative youth, it sometimes becomes lonely and cries at night. It feeds on Wurmple that live in forests.\nIn the Pokémon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum caught one and used it throughout the third-generation story arc, during which it evolved into a Swellow.",
