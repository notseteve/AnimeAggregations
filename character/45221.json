  "description" : "A new high-class mobile suit of the Jegan series, developed by Anaheim Electronics as part of the Earth Federation Forces` UC Project. It was intended to be an escort machine for the Unicorn Gundam. Because the Unicorn Gundam`s operating time in Destroy Mode is limited, the Jesta`s main mission is to suppress the enemy`s regular forces, creating conditions that allow the Unicorn Gundam to directly confront enemy Newtype weapons. In other words, the Federation Forces expected this mobile suit to prepare the stage for \"Newtype hunting.\" These machines are currently assigned to the Ra Cailum for evaluation tests.",
