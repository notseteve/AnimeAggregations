  "description" : "* Ability: Change towels into iron\n* Ability Level 2: Make his steel towels into powerful magnets.\nSano can change towels into iron by holding his breath, however sharp-eyed fans can see that sometimes it appears to be voice-activated instead. But after he gives the commands, he is sometimes left with a second or two to stop breathing in.\nSano, a 9th grader at Inaho Junior High School, was known as the Genius of Robert`s Ten while he was part of it. But he had joined because the leader of Robert`s Ten (Karlpaccho) had placed a Death Pentagon on Sano`s King of the Celestial World Candidate Inumaru that would kill him by removing all his blood unless he listened to Robert.\nSano can be creative with his power, creating shields, springboards (spring) and even boomerangs which he calls \"boomerang cutter\".\nHe has a burn over his left eye which was caused during an accident with a hot spring. Still, he does love those hot springs and hopes to get the blank talent to obtain the talent of discovery in order to find a hot spring of his own.\nHis Level 2 makes his steel towels into powerful magnets. Seems to possess a ridiculous amount of his necessary towels, pulling them out of his robe in rapid succession. Sano is seen teaming up with Rinko in various episodes. It seems he has a crush on Rinko.",
