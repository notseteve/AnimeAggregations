  "description" : "Himiko adheres closely to Kaon and is one of Mika`s many lovers, although the relationship is not romantic; rather, Himiko is Mika`s subordinate in all things, with Mika using her as she sees fit. Himiko has even mentioned that her name was `assigned` to her by Mika. She is based on the character Himeko Kurusugawa from Kannazuki no Miko and has been said to be Himeko`s reincarnation. She certainly initially seems to display Himeko`s lack of self-confidence and strong emotional bond with Chikane`s counterpart, Kaon.",
