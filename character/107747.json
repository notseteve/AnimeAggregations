  "description" : "Stonjourner is a Rock-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nStonjourner`s body is made of boulders and stones. Occasionally, it will unleash a burst of speed to perform dynamic feats with its legs. Most of the time, it prefers standing in a field watching the sun`s progress, preferring a quiet life. Curiously, once every year on a certain day, the Stonjourner from all over gather to form an evenly squared ring or circle. No one knows the reason why they assemble in this formation, leading to many theories, notably the position of sun, the earth`s energy, and other factors.",
