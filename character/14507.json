  "description" : "Maya is the younger brother of Kira. Red-haired, he is half human half angel, his mother being the human. He left Heaven with Kira and wanders around Earth in the hopes of finding their mother. He was very upset when Kira told him that they were leaving (especially since Maya wishes to be one of the Saint Beast so that everyone who bullied him - for being half human - will look at him with respect), and needed convincing by Judas who got hurt in the process. He is very close friends with Gai. He is the son of Lucifer.\nAttribute: Sunlight\nAbility: Manipulating spirits\nImage Color: Orange",
