  "description" : "A runaway senior high school student. During a family dispute concerning what seems to be her missing cat named `angel`, Miyuki stabbed her father (believing him to be responsible for the disappearance), and has stayed away from her home since, losing a substantial amount of weight. She found a personals ad in an old newspaper in the course of the film that hints that her father wasn`t responsible for the disappearance of her cat, and that the cat seems to have come back. That ad is the reason why she decided to call her father again.",
