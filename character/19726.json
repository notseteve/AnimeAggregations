  "description" : "Wife of the Cross Guard soldier Jake and mother of Jack, she resides on a small farm with her son and later, when he`s away, a pair of werewolves who once attacked their farm. Jack is very close to her heart, especially after Jake was killed by the knight Vizel in the first War Games, and she at first discourages him to get in any fights with any opponent who may try to kill him, even if facing them is the right thing to do (when the werewolves were terrorizing their farm, she happily tolerated their cruel gorging for fear that Jack would get hurt if they tried to stand up for themselves). However, after Jack`s triumph over the werewolves, and later during Jack`s first match in the War Games she realizes that the time has come for Jack to become a man and that she should support him in this. One of her regrets is that while she taught Jack everything she knew about farming, she never taught him the proper way to treat a lady, and Jack is thus a little bit of a pervert. Jack`s mother also takes Pano in hand and considers her like a daughter, (or more like a daughter-in-law, as a wife for her son).",
