  "description" : "Andrew Graham is the Gundam fighter for Neo-Canada. While Argo Gulskii and his pirate crew were escaping from the space police, their ship collided into the station where Andrew and his wife, Norma were working as space police. Norma was sucked out into space despite Argo`s attempt to rescue her. Andrew blamed Argo for the death of his wife and entered as a Gundam fighter in a quest for vengeance. Domon would later facilitate an unofficial match between Argo and Andrew, which resulted in a draw. Afterward, Nastasha explained Neo-Russia`s ruling Norma`s death as an accident. Andrew refused to believe this and returned to fight Argo in the finals. It wasn`t until the two were matched against berserker Allenby that Andrew remembered the entire event; that it had been an accident. Realizing the error of his ways, he protected Argo by absorbing a permanently crippling blow from Allenby. Unable to pilot a Gundam any longer, he is last seen boarding a plane back to Neo-Canada for medical treatment.\nHe piloted the GF13-037NCA Lumber Gundam (Grizzly Gundam in the dub).",
