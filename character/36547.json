  "description" : "Akizuki Ryou is the cousin of Akizuki Ritsuko and an idol from 876 Production. He is calm, soft, and all-around a cool and collected boy. In many ways, he is the opposite of his sometimes-harsh cousin. He carries an air of femininity, due to which he tends to be asked out by male classmates.\nDeeply worried by his feminine image and hoping to become more popular with the girls, Ryou has been considering becoming an idol for a long time, but when he visits the 765 Production office to discuss this idea with his cousin Ritsuko, she appears skeptical towards his plans. However, she is prepared to introduce him to Okamoto Manami, a manager at 876 Production. Manami, in deep trouble because of an 876 idol having become unable to perform at a live that is about to take place, is glad to accept Ryou as a substitute. Much to his disturbance, he has to go on stage dressed as a girl.\nRitsuko, noticing Ryou`s charming on-stage appearance, decides that he should make his debut with 765 Production after all. Ryou immediately refuses because Ritsuko wants him to debut as a girl idol, and he does not like the idea of being toyed with by his cousin. He chooses to join 876 Production instead so he will be able to debut in his own way.\nHowever, when he is officially being taken in by 876 Production, president Ishikawa decides that Ryou will continue to perform as a female idol for the time being. His fans and his fellow 876 idols Hidaka Ai and Mizutani Eri are not aware that Ryou is actually male.\nSource: iM@S wiki",
