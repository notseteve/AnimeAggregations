  "description" : "Beshimi, the smallest of the Oniwabanshuu, uses his speed to compensate for his lack of strength. Beshimi received no prosperous government job offers because he had competency in one skill. He is a bottom-ranked onmitsu. His favorite weapons are darts, with which he poisons Yahiko, and later on in the anime jams Kanryuu`s gatling gun. He was gunned down by Kanryuu shortly afterward to help Kenshin defeat him.\nWatsuki stated that Beshimi was \"largely created on-the-spot\" and does not have a motif. Watsuki described the sketched out character sans an already-created personality as being \"kind of timid.\" Not originally intended to be a standalone character, Beshimi became shorter than Kenshin. Watsuki said that Beshimi`s shortness and timidness gave him a group of fans who write to Watsuki saying \"Beshimi KAWAII\" (\"Beshimi is cute!\"). Watsuki said \"not too sure how to feel about that one...\".",
