  "description" : "School librarian and Natsuru`s friend, she is also a Blue Kämpfer like Natsuru. Normally very shy and soft-spoken, she becomes foul-mouthed, bitter, vindictive, and trigger-happy upon transforming into a Kämper. She explained most of the rules of being a Kämpfer when Natsuru`s own Messenger gave no such details. She is a Gewehr type Kämpfer who uses an automatic handgun and appears to be ambidextrous. She later begins to harbour feelings for Natsuru (normal form), eventually becoming jealous and easily irritable when he talks about another girl (most if not all of the time being Kaede) in front of her or when another girl takes an interest in him (whether that interest is romantic in nature or not).",
