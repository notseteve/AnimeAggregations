  "description" : "Tamano Hinagiku is the tomboy of the team. She is blunt, outgoing, athletic and can appear to be rude to people who just met her. Hinagiku`s courage often gets her into trouble, and she enjoys endlessly teasing her friends. Even so, underneath all that strength, there is really a sensitive and understanding girl. Hinagiku lives in a family of four: herself, her younger brother, her father and her mother who is a tomboy just like Hinagiku.\nHinagiku works for the school newspaper, with no real definite position. She often switches around with Yuri. Besides that, she also practices Judo, and is excellent at it too. She has her heart set on Yanagiba Kazuya, the star player of the Saint Flower Garden soccer team. But of course, there is also Takuruu, who has been Hinagiku`s close friend since childhood...",
