  "description" : "Satou Sei is the exact opposite of most of the characters in the series: loud, rough-around-the-edges, she loves doing what she can to push other peoples` buttons. She especially finds joy in teasing http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Yumi] (and also enjoys irritating http://anidb.net/ch1193 [Sachiko] in the process) as she likes to see their reactions; Yumi affectionately calls that her \"old man\" behavior. However, Sei is one of the wisest and most caring characters in the series. Though seeming to have a playful and laid-back attitude, Sei has experienced many tragedies in her life, especially in her second year. Sei believes that http://anidb.net/ch1197 [Shimako], her petite s≈ìur, should learn to solve her problems on her own, because that way she`ll become stronger.\nWhile the relationship between Sei and Shimako seems cold, the truth is that Shimako is extremely devoted to Sei. Their relationship, as Yumi noted, is something that cannot be easily understood. After graduating from the high school division of Lillian, Sei studies English and American Literature at Lillian University.\nSource: Wikipedia",
