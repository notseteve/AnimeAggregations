  "description" : "A 14-year-old girl whose life changes when she encounters the Puella Magi Homura and the familiar Kyubey, who offers to transform her into a Puella Magi herself. She sees herself as a person without special qualities or talents, and after seeing Mami fighting against witches, wants to help people as a Puella Magi the same way Mami does. Madoka becomes uncertain about becoming a Puella Magi after Mami`s death in battle, though she still accompanies her friend, Sayaka, on witch hunts. She is averse to fighting and wishes that everyone would get along. She is implied to have large amount of magical potential within her, and Kyubey is particularly interested in forming a contract with her; however, she has yet to take him up on the offer.",
