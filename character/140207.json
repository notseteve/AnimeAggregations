  "description" : "In Episode 14, he calls the military to bring Sonic to the White House for a party (who refuses because of a planned outing with Chris` friend, Helen), and goes as far as to get the reporters purposely drunk (in the dub, it`s toned down) so they`ll stay. In Episode 21, he initially decides to call the military in (since Sonic refuses to race against Chris`s uncle, Sam Speed), but decides against it and secretly calls Eggman and asks for his help. At the end, Jerome is exposed for making the deal, and is fired. Occasionally, one will see him as a homeless man in later episodes.\n(Source: MyAnimeList)",
