  "description" : "Kenso is a young Pokémon trainer that had a double battle against Suwama at the Astilbe Town Battle Club. His name was only revealed in the Japanese closed captions and was not revealed in any episode dialog.\nHis battle with Suwama didn`t last very long but it garnered a lot of attention in the Battle Club as Ash and his friends could hear people cheering in the hallway and then came to watch the battle. After loosing the battle, Suwama confronted Kenso and tried to get him to give up his Pokémon. Kenso`s timid nature was apparent as he didn`t stand up for himself and Iris butt in and got mad at Suwama for trying to take Kenso`s Pokémon.",
