  "description" : "The first Angel is Adam. It appeared just before Second Impact as a \"giant of light\" that resembles an Eva, and was also shown to have four wings (shown separately). All of the other Angels (apart from Lilith, Adam`s \"equal\") are descended from Adam, although it is not made clear whether this is in a biological sense or a metaphysical sense. Adam`s descendants possess the \"Fruit of Life,\" the source of the Angels` power and immortality (also known as the SÂ² Engine).\nAdam was discovered in the White Moon, buried under Antarctica. The Katsuragi Expedition attempted a \"contact experiment\" with Adam using the Lance of Longinus, which went out of control and triggered Second Impact. Adam`s body was reduced to an embryonic form, and its soul was resurrected into Kaworu Nagisa. Adam`s body was later retrieved and used as the basis for the Evangelions, with the exception of Unit 01.\nLater, Ryoji Kaji delivered Adam, encased in dura-bakelite, to Nerv commander Gendou Ikari, who at an unspecified later time had Adam grafted to his right palm. The series did not reveal what purpose this served, but in End of Evangelion, Gendou tried to physically merge Rei with Adam by pushing his right hand into her body.",
