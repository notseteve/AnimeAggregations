  "description" : "Kikyou Rio is a first-year university student taking up Political Economics and the keyboardist for the band Argonavis.\nRio excelled at everything since his childhood and was called a \"child prodigy\". He hoped to be a baseball player in the future, but right before he was able to participate in Koshien, he was injured and he abandoned that path. Although he doesn`t reveal his emotions, seems apathetic to people, and doesn`t get close to anyone, he responded easily to Yuto Goryo`s scout. Since joining the band, he has been giving his all. He`s also the son of the director of a famous confectionery company in Hakodate.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream! Wiki",
