  "description" : "Yoshida is another close friend of Sawako. She is the tomboy of the group. She has a soft spot for innocent mannered people, so she takes a near instant liking to Sawako. In Kurumi`s fake rumours it was passed around that she was a former Yankee, though Chizuru just takes the rumour as a means of scaring people off or as a joke for her friends. Chizuru is mostly only the slower side of things; she did not realise that Kazehaya liked Sawako until late in the series, after they started their second year of high school.\nShe is a close childhood friend with Sanada Ryu, who is also the son of her favourite ramen shop`s owner, and went to the same middle school as Kazehaya. She has a crush on Ryu`s brother, Tooru.",
