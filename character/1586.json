  "description" : "Later, the helmet-less Enki has been redeployed as the degraded \"Enkidu\" and sports a new sickle-like weapon, which is affixed to its head. When wielded, it provides an alternative to the dual swords the Enki usually resorts to in melee combat. Furthermore, it is also capable of shelling from afar by physically launching munitions from the same point on its head, once the sickle has been removed.",
