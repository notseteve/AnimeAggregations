  "description" : "Saionji Haruto is an heir to a rich family and Student Council President. He, along with Hiruda, are transported to End Earth before the other main characters. When he first encounters his old friends in End Earth, he is revealed to be an enemy. He became the Emperor of Baelgard, and goes by the name \"Traihard\".\nLike Souma and Kiriya, he is also a Soul Blader, and chooses to draw swords from Baelgard`s four guardians, which includes Hiruda Reia. Seeing Soul Bladers as \"chosen ones\", he offers Kiriya and Souma to join him in his crusade. Saionji plans to conquer all of End Earth, under the pretense that he is actually \"saving\" it from darkness. His plans, however, are thwarted by Killrain`s release of dark energy. After Hiruda reverts back to her normal self, Hiruda attempts to rescue Saionji when he is linked to the dark tower, with his life in danger. It is then that Saionji realizes her true feelings for him, and in return, he seems to develop feelings for her also, resulting in him being able to draw his Holy Grail from her heart.\nIn the end, he decides to stay in End Earth, together with Hiruda, Xecty and Jin-Crow in Baelgard, to restore the forest back to its former glory.\nSaionji is an extremely talented swordsman, he was capable of defeating Kiriya in a duel with normal swords.\nSource: Wikipedia",
