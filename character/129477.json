  "description" : "So is Haruto`s father and Sae`s husband. After hearing his wife being startled by Ash Ketchum, who came to eat some Oran Berries just outside their house, he told him he could have some of the berries and he then went back inside to continue painting. Sae apologized for her husbands abrupt behavior as he had become a little unfriendly.\nHis son died a year earlier. When Ash told So that Haruto had asked him to return it from the Mankey he got it from, he thought Ash was lying but then Sae explained to Ash what had happened and that was the hat her son used to wear. She would work in the city and So would work in his atelier, so it was rare for them to be together and the one day the were all together, Haruto was wearing that hat and they were looking up into the sky.\nAfter they lost their son, So only drew pictures of the sky as Haruto he loved looking at the sky. After returning the hat, So planned to paint not only the sky, but also Haruto`s favorite forest and Pok√©mon.",
