  "description" : "Sidoh is the Shinigami whose Death Note was stolen by Ryuk. By the time he realises this, however, the note has already changed hands several times, ending up in the hands of Mello`s gang (more specifically, Mello`s subordinate, Jack Neylon). After repeatedly hounding Ryuk for its return, he tracks down the gang to get it back. In order to regain his Note, Sidoh agrees to help Mello`s gang against Near`s SPK and the Kira investigation team. He wears heavy clothing, obscuring most of his features, and his head is wrapped in bandages.",
