  "description" : "Kusanagi Hokuto is an elementary school student chosen by Dendou to be one of its pilots during a Garufa raid on Earth. Hokuto is intelligent and studious, with great skill in using computers and an interest in Soccer. His level-headed and incisive demeanor contrasts and complements that of his fellow Dendou pilot Izumo Ginga, who tends to be short-tempered and impulsive. Hokuto has great talent in being able to reproduce the body movements of others, allowing him to synchronise with the martial artist Ginga`s controls while piloting Dendou.",
