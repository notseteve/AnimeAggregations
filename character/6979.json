  "description" : "Also known as Golden Witch, the Witch in Gold, or the Endless Witch, Beatrice is a witch who has lived for over a thousand years. She is said to appear as a cloud of golden butterflies, and has the power to summon higher demons among the seventy-two pillars to serve her. It is said that humans can summon her and get their wish granted in exchange for compensation, though she often acts whimsically. Her \"Endless Magic\" allows her to kill anyone indefinitely, by killing and resurrecting them endlessly, regardless of the methods or circumstances.",
