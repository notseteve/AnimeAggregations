Within Snake, however, he serves under http://anidb.net/ch8972 [Liang Qi], whom he is in love with, as an adviser. He is often her primary victim of venting frustrations from being unable to win over http://anidb.net/ch8970 [Alphard]`s attention, usually as airsoft gun target practice. However, he does not mind it, as he is a masochist. Publicly, Cummings is accompanied by a Snake member named as his personal bodyguard.\nHe eventually kills Liang Qi in order to free her of her pain; in return, she grants his request and says she loves him.\nSource: Wikipedia",
