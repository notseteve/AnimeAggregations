  "description" : "Sophocles`s Vikavolt is the evolved form of Sophocles`s Charjabug. It rescued Horacio from falling into a chasm ravine just after it evolved. It then flew across to get the Bug Stone and gave it to Horacio as Charjabug had already evolved and didn`t need it.\nIt battled against Mina`s Ribombee in the Top 16 round of the Alola League. Mina`s Ribombee showed off its fast movements and its ability to dodge moves making it hard for Vikavolt to land any attacks with it zigzagging all the time until Vikavolt anticipated Ribombee’s movements and caught it with its pincers. It used Signal Beam while caught and knocked out Ribombee.\nIn the Alola Pokémon League quarterfinals third match, Kiawe`s Charizard battled against Sophocles`s Vikavolt. Sophocles had thoroughly researched Kiawe’s battle strategies so that his Vikavolt would put on the pressure against Charizard, who was the stronger and more experienced battler in the match-up. Charizard endured a make-or-break moment when it burned off the Savage Spin-Out Z-Move. For a lot of the match, Vikavolt was really pressing its attack, while Charizard was only playing defense. Vikavolt had learned the new move Wild Charge and that surprised Kiawe but totally met his every expectation for a good battle. Charizard and Kiawe used Supersonic Skystrike which was too strong for Vikavolt`s Wild Charge and it was knocked out.",
