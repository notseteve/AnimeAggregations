  "description" : "Hatsuya is a Level 2 power user who was on the receiving end of a lot of bullying. He became hateful towards Judgment for always showing up late or not at all. When he obtains the Level Upper to enhance his ability to use aluminium objects as explosive devices, he starts to attack various Judgment members. His last attack was on Kazari, but she was protected thanks to Touma`s Imagine Breaker, and Hatsuya is subsequently beaten by Mikoto. He later falls unconscious as a result of Level Upper`s side effects.",
