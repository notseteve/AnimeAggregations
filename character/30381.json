  "description" : "Kureha is the younger sister of Kinjirou, who is a first year in high school and loves martial arts. She is a member of the crafts club. After watching and following Kinjirou and Subaru, believing him a male pervert cross-dresser, attacks Subaru to reclaim Kinjirou, only to be quickly defeated in turn. After this incident, still believing her a male, she has fallen in love with Subaru, much to Kinjirou`s chagrin. While tomboyish most of the time, she tends to try and act feminine when Subaru is around. Due to her father dying from an illness she gets extremely worried whenever her brother gets sick.",
