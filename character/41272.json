  "description" : "A boy with dark messy hair and round glasses. He is a student at Lutwidge and serves Eliot. He has a calm and collected demeanor and is hardly rattled by anything. Leo is very observant and discovered Oz`s identity as an intruder. Despite being Elliot`s servant, he doesn`t always take his side and will make him apologize if needed. Also, Leo could hit Eliot if he`s doing or saying something wrong to his eyes. He is rarely seen without Eliot. Leo carries a gun and is apparently hopeless with it and swords, according to Elliot.\nSource: Wikipedia",
