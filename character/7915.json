  "description" : "Kaori is mainly in Shiori`s story, but is regularly seen due to her being Nayuki`s best friend and Yuichi`s and Nayuki`s classmate, as well as the class representative. She is very smart and knows a lot about the schoolmates and townspeople, but doesn`t appear to be aware of any of the supernatural things that happen, even after Yuichi`s caring saves someone close to her. Her surname and appearance indicate that she is Shiori`s sister, and Shiori affirms this, but Kaori vehemently denies it. Jun Kitagawa once commented how she started to act differently once they entered their second year in high school.",
