  "description" : "Yamask is a Ghost-type Pokémon introduced in Generation V.\nIt evolves into Cofagrigus starting at level 34.\nIn Galar, Yamask has a Ground/Ghost-type regional form. It evolves into Runerigus when the player travels under the stone bridge in Dusty Bowl after Yamask has lost at least 49 HP from attacks and did not faint in the same battle or since.\nYamask is a shadow-like Pokémon holding a mask that has a face from its time as a human. It has two shadowy, tendril-like arms and large, red eyes. It also has a small tail-like appendage that holds the mask. Yamask is capable of speech when possessing a human, but not in its regular form.\nDue to being a human long ago, it has memories of being a human. If someone wears the mask Yamask carries, they will become possessed by the Yamask in question. Sometimes, it looks at this mask and cries, apparently in longing. Yamask is known to wander the ruins of ancient civilizations.\nThe Yamask of Galar have purple eyes and a small piece of an ancient stone tablet is directly attached to its tail. The tablet bears cursed engravings, and is said to be absorbing Yamask`s dark power.",
