  "description" : "Sanctuary is a fictional location from the manga series Saint Seiya, later adapted to anime. It is also the residence of an organization with the same name.\nThe leader of the Sanctuary is Athena in her human reincarnation. But since Athena only descends down from Olympus as a human incarnation only once every roughly two hundred years, the charge was left mainly to the Pope, the highest rank of the Sanctuary, and her second in command, followed by 88 Saints and more soldiers.\nThe goal of the Sanctuary is to protect Athena and maintain peace of the world in secret, with least to no interference on most of the affairs around the world in which most of the world population can solve problems on their own. Sanctuary will intervene only when the things that threaten to destroy peace of the world cannot be handled by any other means but the power of Cosmo, most of them cataclysmic and are of divine forces.",
