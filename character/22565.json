  "description" : "Otoshi`s Marowak is used in a battle against Ash`s Bulbasaur and Pikachu. However, after defeating Bulbasaur, it is quickly defeated by Pikachu. After realising that all of its hard work earning the badges was lost after Otoshi`s were stolen, it left him. After seeing a few random trainers training with eachother in the forest and remembering times with Otoshi, it decides to return to him and ends up saving his Doduo from Jessie`s capture. It defeats Team Rocket quite easily, gets the badges back, and goes on with Otoshi to the Indigo Plateau.",
