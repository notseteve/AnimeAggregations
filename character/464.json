  "description" : "Dragonair is the evolved form of Dratini. They look like desert serpents with a long, noticeable, light-blue and white body. They have a small horn on the forehead and two wing-shaped protuberances on the sides of the head which are often said to be ears, but are in fact wings, as evidenced in the short film preceding Pok√©mon: The Movie 2000. They have a blue orb placed at the neck and another two near the tip of the tail. Dragonair can discharge energy through the orbs to envelop itself in a gentle aura. This aura, which makes its body shine slightly and gives it a mystical appearance, is said to enable the Dragonair to control the weather in the immediate area and change it in a matter of minutes.\nDragonair live in large bodies of water such as the lakes or the sea. They store an enormous amount of energy inside their bodies, and seems to manifest itself in two distinct fashions. Even though they lack large wings, Dragonair have been seen flying with the wings on the side of the head greatly enlarged.",
