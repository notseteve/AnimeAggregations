  "description" : "An elegant, introverted girl with long groomed black hair and a red hairband. Yukiko usually wears either a red cardigan over her school uniform blouse or a pink yukata, and is sometimes also seen carrying a paper fan, which she uses in battle, or a red umbrella. Her family owns a famous ryokan in the city and Yukiko is always busy preparing herself to take over the business. She is named the next owner of the ryokan and feels oppressed by her expected duties. Despite her elegant appearance, she carries a whimsical side prone to fits of laughter.\nHer Persona is Konohana-sakuya of The Priestess Arcana, resembling a Tokusatsu heroine and being almost completely pink in color, her uniform is reminiscent of a high school cheerleader`s uniform. Like Yukiko, it appears to carry a pair of fans. Yukiko is skilled with healing and fire spells. Konohana Sakuya will evolve into Amaterasu once Yukiko`s Priestess Social Link is maxed out.\nHer Shadow takes the form of a caged red lovebird with Yukiko`s hair, that is able to summon a prince-like Shadow to assist it. It represents her resentment towards having her destiny already chosen for her as inheritor of the Amagi Inn and her desires to be rescued and taken far away by her \"prince\" Chie, as she feels \"caged\" in Inaba. Her Midnight Channel dungeon is a pink Romanesque castle filled with medieval furniture.",
