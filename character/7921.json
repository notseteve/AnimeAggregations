  "description" : "Undead (Pai`s \"Wu\").\nYakumo`s father was an archaeology professor who went to Tibet to study the legend of the Sanjiyans, but died a natural death after he met Pai, while he was trying to get out of Yunnan (a province of China, near Tibet). Yakumo carries his father`s legacy: the promise to make Pai human.\nAt the start of the story he is 17, but later had to quit high school due to the pressures of being an immortal. He worked part-time in Culture Shock, a gay bar in Shinjuku (he has no homosexual inclination, though). Later, he worked as an employee of Yougekisha.",
