  "description" : "She is Eitarou`s familiar described as being \"She is a relatively ethical character in the show.\" She is actually a type of demonic beast, called Vergest, and she is known to be the strongest among them all. Eitarou has her dressed up as a dog-girl maid and is very devoted to him, but will not hesitate to harm him if he strays off because of his perverted ways. She is a very capable fighter, able to fight on-par with Tanarot with the ability to make copies of herself and fights with a spear which also has a broom on the other end. It is hinted that she might have feelings for Takuto as she was annoyed that he referred to her as a \"mother figure\" and has a picture of when they went out on their \"date\" stickered to her weapon.\nSakuma even made a bunch of miniature versions of her. All of them function properly except for one that is comically seen tripping and needing the help of the others and even a giant robot version. He is proud on how detailed he is at designing these robots from the same type of underwear she uses to the placement of her birthmarks, only to be harmed by Eneus before he describes where that birthmark is. Eneus is constantly lecturing him about his hobbies.",
