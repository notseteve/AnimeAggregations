  "description" : "Yuusaku`s childhood friend who transfers into his class midway through their second year of high school. She is very beautiful and even works as a model, though after she transfers school, she temporarily stops modelling. However, she still continues to go to the gym readily and maintains a slim figure. She is always kind and generous towards others, though this is merely a deception. In truth, she is arrogant and will not hesitate to use abusive language towards others. During her first meeting with Taiga, Ami shows her true colours, but the tables are turned when Taiga throws a counterattack back at her. Since then, Ami and Taiga have been enemies, though Ami still sometimes envies Taiga since she can always be honest. Ami has a love interest in Ryuuji, asking him if he would love her real self, going as far as to bet Taiga to a swim race for the chance of having Ryuuji all to herself at her villa. She has recently shown a deeper affection for Ryuuji when she states that Minori will not be good for him, comparing the two to her being the sun and him the moon, and if he is with her he would burn out. Then states that a person more suited for him, would be her.",
