  "description" : "Ogasawara Sachiko is a student in her 2nd year at the Lillian Girls` Academy. Though prim, elegant and somewhat aloof, Sachiko has both a rough and a very sweet side. She is afraid of heights and dislikes men, to the point where she will do anything she can to avoid interacting or being near one. She is very protective of her petite sœur, http://anidb.net/ch1192 [Fukuzawa Yumi], and cares deeply about her. Unfortunately, she often has the same problem that Yumi does—she does not share most of her problems with her sœur, causing many misunderstandings.\nSachiko is slated to marry her cousin and fiancé http://anidb.net/ch15124 [Kashiwagi Suguru] after she graduates. This has caused her some distress since, because although she initially cared deeply for him, but he did not reciprocate. They now have a complicated relationship.\nSource: Wikipedia",
