  "description" : "Saori Vageena is one of the active female members of the anime forum that Kirino wound up frequenting, and organized the get-together in Akihabara where she met Kirino and Kuroneko for the first time. She is the peacemaker of the group, and her friendly disposition helps to defuse tensions between Kirino and Kuroneko, keeping their arguments about each other`s tastes from getting out of hand. She tends to speak in a very quirky way, always using a very polite and antiquated mode of Japanese generally heard today only in samurai movies. Not much is known about her for certain, not even her real name (Saori Vageena is her handle on the anime board and evidently a pseudonym), but brief scenes of her at home show her in what looks a large mansion, attended by maids and butlers, implying that she is very wealthy, although neither the Kousaka siblings nor Kuroneko seem to be aware of this.",
