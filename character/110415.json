  "description" : "Hermann von Lüneburg was an Imperial rear admiral who defected twice. He was one of the former regimental commanders of the Rosen Ritter Infantry Regiment, which comprised of children and former citizens who defected from the Empire. The reason for his defection back to the Empire is unknown but it was speculated that Lüneburg returned to the Empire because his blood lineage was related to that of the ruling Goldenbaum Dynasty.\nGineipedia",
