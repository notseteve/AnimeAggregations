  "description" : "Bianca only recently started traveling as her father just wouldn`t allow her to start a journey when she wanted to. She is fully motivated for battling and getting gym badges but considers herself quite lazy when it comes to cleaning chores. She is also very eccentric and clumsy. Her purse contains many items that she carries around with her but the inside of it is quite dusty. When she originally met Iris and Dent, she told them she had two badges at that time.\nWhile on route to Shippo City, Ash and friends bumped into Bianca. She had been looking for Ash to deliver a badge case to him from Professor Juniper. Before she could deliver it to him a Chillarmy took the badge case because it was dirty. She instantly fell in love with the Chillarmy and decided she wanted to get it. She attempted to capture it by setting traps but it wasn`t until she took out the monster ball to catch it that Chillarmy noticed was dirty and ended up capturing itself.\nBianca and Ash had battle after they got their Pokémon healed at the Pokémon Center. Pikachu battled Bianca`s Chaoboo but Pikachu proved to be a superior opponent with its Volt Tackle and Bianca was defeated.\nBianca is also a main character in the 5th generation games Black and White. Players encounter and battle her throughout the game.",
