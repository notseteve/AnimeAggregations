  "description" : "Mamoru Takamura (鷹村 守, Takamura Mamoru?), voiced by Rikiya Koyama, is a strong boxer that has never lost a match. He has an incredible athletic ability that shows through in his strength. Takamura also has an insatiable appetite for women, which is only overshadowed by his obsession for victory. At one point, he single-handedly knocks out an adult bear while sustaining gashes on his arm and most notably on his chest. The weakened bear is eventually killed, and he is dubbed \"The Bear Slayer\", he honors it by wearing its pelt, and the scars proudly.\nHe originally is a delinquent that often gets into fights. Because of his strength, he often leaves the victims with serious injuries. He was disowned by his family due to a brawl initiated by Takamura that happened during a rugby match (with his older brother competing), when fans started booing Takamura`s brother, by the time the brawl was over, at least 20 people were beat up. After that incident, he continues to fight until he meets Coach Kamogawa. After weeks of training, and without a single spar, Takamura defeats his first opponent in 25 seconds of the first round by KO. His aspiration is to conquer the World Title in several weight classes, from Junior Middleweight and up.",
