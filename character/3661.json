Mimiru plays as a \"tough-it-out-through-anything\" player, who is poor at planning things out and following through on them. She meets Tsukasa and soon becomes one of the few he trusts and he eventually sees her as a friend. She also teams up with Bear, who she refers to as an \"old man\", and spends considerable time in the series attempting to figure out what Bear`s career is in real life.",
