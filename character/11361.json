  "description" : "Musubi (Sekirei #88) is the main heroine of the series. She met Minato when she literally fell out of the sky while being chases by other Sekirei.\nMusubi specializes in hand-to-hand combat which utilizes her greatly enhanced strength, enforced by the heavy combat gloves she always wears. Musubi`s `uniform` consists of a short red skirt and her upper clothes resemble those traditionally worn by a Miko. During periods of anger or jealousy, an image of a ferocious bear appears behind her, which is a result of her being Miya`s disciple. She is quite naive, often saying things she doesn`t understand and is the most \"childish\" of Minato`s Sekirei, even more so than Kusano, yet at times can be insightful. Musubi is the most \"competitive\" of Minato`s Sekirei, often showing great eagerness to fight other Sekirei, but never fails to be polite as she would usually ask for permission first before fighting them. She eats a lot and is a fairly decent cook, but she can only cook curry in large amounts. Musubi`s known attacks are the Kuma-ken (Bear Fist) and Kuma-ryusei (Bear Meteor).",
