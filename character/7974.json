  "description" : "Kooan is the youngest of the sisters and represents a counterpart of Hino Rei. Her name is short for kouankou (紅安鉱), the Japanese word for kermesite.\nKooan, like all of her sisters, is very vain about her appearance to the point of swearing death upon anyone who smudges her make-up or ruins her hair, and she relies on her charms to get what she wants. She believes that she and Rubeus are in a relationship, and competes with her sisters for his love.\nHer attack is Dark Fire, in which she threw blue fire at her target.\nSource: wiki",
