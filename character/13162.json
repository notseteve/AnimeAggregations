  "description" : "Rygart is the series` main protagonist at the age of 25. He was born an un-sorcerer, meaning that he can`t use magic, unlike the majority of the worlds populace. Before he left to see Hodr, he worked on a farm with his brother who`s also an un-sorcerer, because of this, his father sold all Quartz operated tools and worked with tools without Quartz. After his father took out loans, he was able to attend a military school where he befriended Zess, Hodr, and Sigyn where the four of them were known as \"the four problem children of Assam`s Military School\", him being known as the \"King of Make-up tests\". He hates violence and believes he can win via his opponent tiring out before him. He later becomes the pilot of the Dirfringe, an ancient mecha designed for only an un-sorcerer`s use as a Heavy Knight for Krisna. He originally joins the war to protect his brother and friends but later admits he`s really fighting to protect Sigyn.",
