  "description" : "Gouda Kazundo is a fictional character in http://anidb.net/cr871 [Shirow Masamune]`s Ghost in the Shell anime series. He is the primary antagonist of http://anidb.net/a1176 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG]. In the series, Gouda is head of a data manipulation division within the Cabinet Intelligence Service.\nWhile on a mission, Gouda was involved in an accident and had to have cybernetic parts installed. He was horribly disfigured, but, curiously, chose not to repair his face with easily available cybernetic parts. During a failed training exercise by the Japanese military for its new helicopters, Gouda was dispatched to approach http://anidb.net/ch1588 [Aramaki] with a plan of action to protect the people living in the Refugee Residential District. Gouda later becomes a main suspect in the Individual Eleven case by http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9]. He is the head of the Strategic Influence Investigation Commission within Japan`s Cabinet Intelligence Service, a position which gives him the power to carry out his plans. In addition, he has a valuable ally in Chief Cabinet Secretary Takakura, who aids Gouda`s cause, seemingly to further his own political aspirations.",
