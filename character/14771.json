  "description" : "Rockin` Robin is the mentor of Vanilla and Chocolat. He also records their progress in stealing hearts, for he is an expert. He is a popular rock star in the Human World (Note: Rockin` Robin and \"Rock`n Lovin`\" have the same spelling in katakana). Although he may seem a bit rude and obnoxious, he has a caring heart, although he rarely displays it. According to Blanca, Robin is actually 6800 years old and uses facial masks to retain a youthful and attractive appearance. He seems to be particularly afraid of swords and sharp objects as shown when Chocolat and Vanilla try to learn fencing in the anime. In the manga he loses his life sacrificing himself for Chocolat in the final battle.",
