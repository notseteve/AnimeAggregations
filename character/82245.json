  "description" : "A rouge magic user with a cocky attitude (like most of them), Hellhound attacks with a flaming dog he that commands, hence his name.\nKazuma uses Daiki to lure him out and get him talking about how he got his powers. After hearing what he needs to from him, Kazuma easily disables Hellhound, but a chance encounter distracts Kazuma so much that Hellhound is able to escape.\nSource: MyAnimeList",
