  "description" : "As the primary transport carrier for the Varauta forces the Large Battroid Transport Carrier is somewhat deceptively named in contrast to it`s ubiquitous deployment. Though it transports Battroids, the Transport Carrier can also operate as a support carrier for launching fighters (with many linear catapults) and features fighter command and control equipment. The Transport Carrier also possesses powerful weaponry and heavy armor that allows the ship to engage other warships in combat. In a transport role, the Large Battroid Transport Carrier can hold up to 100 vehicles stowed in the cargo bays.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/varauta-largebattroidtransportcarrier.htm",
