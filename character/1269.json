  "description" : "Mesprit, known as the Emotion Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon that is part of the Psychic-type Lake Trio along with Uxie and Azelf. Mesprit`s name comes from the word sprite, a tiny fairy found in fantasy and fairy tales, or spirit, as its spirit often exits its body, leaving it on the bottom of Lake Verity. It has a small blue body about the size of Mew, and is identical to Uxie and Azelf except for its head. It has a pink head with a jewel embedded in its forehead, and four long ears drooping down its head looking like those of Lucario.\nMesprit is referred to as \"The Being of Emotion,\" and said to have taught humans to sense emotions such as sorrow, pain and joy. If a human touches it, three days after the touch, the person will lose their emotions. Cyrus is one example. When you attempt to capture it, it will roam around Sinnoh. It is thought to have come from the same egg as Uxie and Azelf.",
