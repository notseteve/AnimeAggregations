Kyoshiro believes that he sacrificed himself in an attempt to quell the great catastrophe of ten years prior to the main time line of the story. Soujirou, however, has stated that for all his positive traits, Kazuya was a fool. Mika has added to this that Kazuya was as ruthless as a demon behind his eternal smile and tendency to always be victorious in any challenge. Kyoshiro looks up to him and makes every effort to emulate him, something his brother Soujirou has advised him against and which arouses Mika`s hatred for him.",
