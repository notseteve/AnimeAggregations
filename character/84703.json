He is Bak Chang`s great-uncle.\nZuu Mei was once the greatest sorcerer of the Chang family and worked at http://anidb.net/ch32502 [Central] as a powerful official, where http://anidb.net/ch32795 [Malcolm C. Lvellie] was one of his students. It was during his time at Central, when he was a darker, more power-hungry person who only cared about the status of the Chang Clan, that he proposed the basic idea of the Second Exorcist Project. He was the smith who forged http://anidb.net/ch84620 [Kanda]`s Mugen, and he also taught http://anidb.net/ch32507 [Jeryy] how to cook. During Kanda`s childhood, Zuu Mei was frequently his confidant, assuring Kanda that the lotus blooms he was seeing were only illusions.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
