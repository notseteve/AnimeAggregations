  "description" : "Assistroid, short for assistant android, are helpers to the Catians. They were created from soil, which was rearranged through nanomachines and as such can perform various advanced operations, including teleport.\nAlthough highly advanced they are not provided with a language function and usually express themselves through the use of placards.\nSince Elis created 20 such assistroids and they all look the same, they were given later on numbers to differentiate between them.",
