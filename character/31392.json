  "description" : "Maruyama Silvia, nicknamed \"Sylvie\", defends Japan from the sea using a submarine. Despite her occupation as a member of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), she cannot swim. She has a somewhat curious affection for tangerines, and is frequently depicted eating them. Her clover pin is grey. One quarter English residing from Osaka, she acts casual and even a little loopy. In the manga, she`s crazy about fishing. Her transformation is different than the others, because right after the hat goes on her head, it flies up a bit, and the red part extends and droops down. Her name in the English-language subtitles is alternately written `Sylvia\", though the opening credits show her name as \"Silvia\". In episode 20 when they come face to face with Naru, Silvia makes plenty of allusions to Love Hina (such as, \"When I close my eyes, memories from another life come back to me\") because the japanese voice actress who played Naru plays Silvia, hence, the past allusions, though the same voice actress isn`t the case for the english version. In the anime, she is known to referring to herself as \"I, the officer...\" or the girls as \"We, the officers....\" In the manga, she uses a \"surfer\" dialect, using terms such as calling Mao and Misora \"dudettes\" or \"girlfriends\" in comparison to her Japanese use of \"-yan\" instead of \"-chan.\"\nHer baton activates the Restriction Barrier.",
