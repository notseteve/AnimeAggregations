  "description" : "Claudette is the oldest daughter of the Vance Family. Because she is an illegitimate child of the Count, she is not in the line of succession, and was raised without the care and devotion shown to her two half-sisters. She is charged with protecting Leina, the future countess, and wields a zweihander named Thunderclap which she can use to control lightning.\nIn Queen`s Blade Rebellion, Claudette became Queen after Leina renounces the title to continue wandering the world. However, her strictness led to her becoming a ruthless tyrant, banning the Queen`s Blade tournament as she proclaims herself to be \"chosen by the Gods.\" Along with a new set of armor, her Thunderclap sword also gained a significant upgrade through the power of the \"Wizard Stones\" (courtesy of Ymir), and can now manipulate lightning without readying the sword.\nClaudette`s name is taken from the ancient Roman Emperor Claudius.\nSource: Wiki",
