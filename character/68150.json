  "description" : "Seiryuu is stubborn, anti-social and has a bad temper. He holds a deep hatred for Guren due to his attempted murder of Seimei and considers Masahiro to be unworthy to be Seimei`s successor. Seiryuu even went as far as to say that if Guren ever harms a human again, he would personally kill him. He attacks with blasts of lightning and fights with a large two handed scythe. His second name from Seimei is Shouran (宵藍). Seiryuu cares about Seimei`s wellbeing more than any of the others. However, he always shows his care through anger.\nSource: Wiki",
