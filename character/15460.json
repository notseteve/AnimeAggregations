  "description" : "Yukionna is Rikuo`s trusted attendant and part of Rikuo`s new \"Hyakki Yakou\" who follows him to school disguised as Tsurara Oikawa, a normal schoolgirl. She is affectionate towards Rikuo and even gets jealous when other girls pay him attention. This is also reinforced by the fact that other characters express how bad a situation would be come if Tsurara were to see what other female characters did to Rikuo. She also admires Rikuo`s youkai form, because she finds him very reliable and magnificent. She is overprotective of Rikuo when he is his \"day\" or human form and expresses great concern for his well being, which is the reason why she is always around him at school (which causes misunderstandings and concern on Kana`s part). She also acts as a cook and, though her food is delicious, most of the time it is chilled or cold.\nShe also has a fear of Yura as she is an onmyouji and a rivalry with Kana (going so far as to nearly freeze her), however she protects as her death would sadden Rikuo. She is in Kyoto protecting the Investigation group along with Aotabou. Later, she rejoins Rikuo but is kidnapped by Tsuchigumo.",
