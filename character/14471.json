  "description" : "The most outspoken of the Rowdyruff Boys and most likely acts as their leader, although the boys often act in unison. Like the original, he wears a hat, but his hair is much shorter. He also has a band-aid on his cheek. His weapon of choice is Momoko`s curly straw, which he uses as a spitball shooter. He is represented by a triangle.",
