  "description" : "Melissa is Carossa`s twin sister. She is easily frightened but is far more reasonable and cautious than her brother. She later gains a crush on Michael, much to Carossa`s chagrin. When in armor battle, she and Carossa operate in sync, allowing them to seamlessly combine into one armor for greater strength and defense. The two are also the final product of twin genome project in the wind valley city.\nArmor: Sen of Saturday resembling a chakram\nSide Note: It can be accurately assumned that both Carossa and Melissa were conceived and created in the twin city that L and R Driver came from, for the purpose of testing and assimilating control of the Sen and Sin armors(as it was built for two). And as such that would make them the last living twin specimens to survive the testing and pathological destruction that everyone else inside.",
