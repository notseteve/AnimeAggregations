  "description" : "Meowscarada is a dual-type Grass/Dark Pokémon introduced in Generation IX.\nIt evolves from Floragato starting at level 36. It is the final form of Sprigatito.\nMeowscarada is a humanoid feline Pokémon with light green fur covering most of its body — stopping just above its long, dark green legs - and a short, fluffy tail. The fur is especially longer around its ears, thighs, and arms, the latter resembling poofy sleeves. Its face has lazy pink eyes and a small pink nose, and is covered in a four-pointed mask-like shape, with a pattern of three green diamonds on it. Each of its hands has three fingers tipped with green claws, as well as a pink paw pad. On its neck is a pink collar resembling flower petals, which holds together its cape. The cape is lined with reflective fur, is black on the outside and green on the inside, and splits into two near the base, with both parts of the cape ending in fleur-de-lis shapes.\nMeowscarada carries a four-petaled green flower, whose stem is hidden by the reflective fur on its cape, creating the illusion of floating. The flower can blossom into a round, pollen-filled flower bomb, with a two-tone green and black zigzag pattern on the outside, and six petals adorning the top. In a battle, Meowscarada stealthily plants these flower bombs onto its foes before setting them off, catching the foes unawares.\nMeowscarada is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Flower Trick.",
