  "description" : "Dry and deadpan, slacker Yue is best friends with Nodoka and Haruna. Often prodding Nodoka into escalating her tense relationship with Negi, Yue supports her buddy to the point of sometimes complicating matters. A lover of books, though a pretty indifferent student, Yue is the leader of the Dummy Force; the group of five girls from 2-A with the lowest grades. There is a chance that Yue has the slight tingling of feelings for Negi, but her loyalty to Nodoka helps keep her emotions in check.",
