  "description" : "Karl, Robert`s second in command, has the power to copy another person`s power. The condition is that he has to spend 24 hours within 10 meters of them. He used this to acquire the powers of all of the other members of Robert`s Ten.\nHe has two powers from outside the Ten which are the power to change the opponent`s thoughts to a cell phone Text-message and the power to reverse one`s position with the opponent`s.\nHe uses all of these powers in combat and may actually have had more, but it is unknown as he was knocked out by Ueki`s Masshu. Karl is a very sneaky (yet ironically loud) type who isn`t above underhanded tactics to get what he or Robert wants.\nIn the manga, he is portrayed as somewhat girl-crazy, and even in the anime he says Robert`s Ten should have more girls in it.",
