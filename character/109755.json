  "description" : "One of the \"Mad Cows,\" a duo that once controlled the entire Gangnam area. He`s been working part-time jobs to pay the medical bills for his partner in the duo Woo Seung-Tae , who fell ill with an incurable disease, but the part-time work available to high schoolers is barely enough to cover the daily medical bills and won`t cover a cure. He joins GOH after being told that he can save his friend if he wins.\nSource: Official page",
