  "description" : "The Selecao are twelve individuals (including Akira) which are each given 10 billion yen by the mysterious Mr. Outside for them to spend. This huge sum is in digital currency only and cannot be exchanged for real world money. The Selecao are allowed to spend the money how they see fit, but they must make use of the money to find a way to save the country. The supporter who is hiding as one of the Selecao will be sent by Mr. Outside himself, to assassinate one of the other participants if they try to escape, use the money wrongly or fails with his/her mission to help society; it is also mentioned that when one of them successfully saves Japan, the other remaining ones will be eliminated as well, regardless of their less than complete successes.\nNote: The name Selecao comes from the Portuguese word Seleção (Selection).",
