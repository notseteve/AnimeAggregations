  "description" : "The titular Drifters are heroes, leaders, and great warriors from different eras and cultures that have been brought to an unknown world by http://anidb.net/ch83939 [Murasaki], where they are meant to fight the Ends. A common element to the Drifters is that, although they are driven by violence, victory, and conquest, most of them are not cruel and do not tolerate the hurting of innocents. Unlike the Ends, the Drifters have no magic abilities unless they were born with them, and therefore must largely rely on their technology and tenacity to survive.\nSource: Wikipedia",
