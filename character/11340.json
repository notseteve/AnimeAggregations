  "description" : "Sakurai Shizuku is http://anidb.net/ch11337 [Kanade] and http://anidb.net/ch11338 [Yukino]`s younger sister, from whom she hates being apart. She is a lot more level-headed than her sisters, and she is deeply affected by the actions of Yukino, who she seems to care about more than Kanade. Unlike her sisters, she buries all her emotions deep down without expressing them, but they later resurface in various ways, such as her skipping school.\nSource: English Wikipedia",
