  "description" : "Team Skull Grunts are nasty bunch of people that will force people into battling them if you don`t watch your words and then try to take their opponents Pok√©mon as their prize for winning the battle.\nWhen she first met Meowth, she was enamoured with Meowth by praising it and fawning over it. She wanted to get it because it could talk but Jessie though wouldn`t allow her to take it. Her attitude towards it completely changed though when Meowth won the competition to get the Dark Crystal and she said she hated it.",
