  "description" : "Team Rocket`s Pelipper dropped the Rocket Gachat at a Poké Mart in Vermilion City and Grookey got out of its Poké Ball. After wandering a bit, it arrived at Go`s bedroom and grabbed Goh`s arm and it was still there when he woke up in the morning. Grookey`s not just a mischief-maker and quite stubborn. It lost its stick when Team Rocket tried to recover it and then Goh went looking for it in the morning to return the stick. Grookey broke the Team Rocket Poké Ball and allowed itself to be caught by Goh instead.",
