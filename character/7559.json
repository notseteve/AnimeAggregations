  "description" : "When San (サン) was a baby, the wolf goddess Moro attacked her parents, who were found damaging the forest. San`s parents threw her to Moro as a sacrifice to save their own lives. Moro raised San as her own daughter, and in turn San treats Moro as her mother and Moro`s two natural pups as brothers. The wolf pups accept San as a sister.\nSan`s primary concern is protecting the forest and the animals she lives with. San rejects her own humanity and even thinks of herself as a wolf, even resorting to her animal instincts when she is frightened or angry. She has attempted to assassinate Eboshi of Irontown many times, as San believes that Eboshi`s death will result in the end of Irontown and human growth into the surrounding forest. It is only by Ashitaka`s affection for her that she slowly comes to acknowledge her human side as well.\nAfter the battle for the Forest Spirit`s head, San tells Ashitaka that he is very dear to her, but since she cannot forgive the human race for what they have done to the forest, she will continue to live apart from the humans. San returns to the forest and Ashitaka remains in Irontown.",
