  "description" : "A handsome boxer with an admittedly unimpressive record of 3-3-0 (3KOs), Oda is Makunouchi Ippo`s first opponent in the professional ring. Oda boasts a crushing right straight that easily knocked out his first few opponents; but it was soon revealed, to Coach Mikami`s dismay, that he hated to train. Instead, Oda often chose to spend time with his girlfriend -- the coach`s daughter, Reiko. Later, when he risked losing both Reiko`s favor (she had heard how others mocked Oda for losing his fighting will) and the Nishikawa gym`s support, Oda threw himself into training and regained the spirit of a boxer.\nVoiced by: Nobutoshi Canna",
