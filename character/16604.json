  "description" : "Volcan`s younger brother. Dortin and Volcan are often viewed as comic relief throughout the series. They are two trolls who are always low on money, and seem to always find a way to mess up whatever Orphen is trying to accomplish. They work in Cleao`s basement, cutting up food and whatnot; she is their employer. As for his character, Dortin is the voice of reason (that is never paid any attention to) on his and Volcan`s quests. He is kind and knowledgable, though some consider him something of a nerd. When Volcan messes up, Dortin always tries to tell Orphen he had no part in Volcan`s schemes, but they both wind up being victim`s of Orphen`s magical blasts anyway. Dortin is shown to be quite caring and loyal, as he begs Orphen for help in saving his brother from mushroom poisoning and, later, in defying Volcan`s \"order\" to run from danger when a friend needed his help. In the novels, he and Cleo depart, but not before he bestows a surmountable emount of magical power to her so that she may grow as a sorceress.\nSource: Wikipedia",
