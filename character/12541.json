  "description" : "The most powerful Black Knight after Avaritia. She fights using two Japanese swords that are similar to Misuzu`s. She is in fact the only Black Knight who has no association with Index. Rather, she is actually Kusakabe Misao, the Kusakabe onmyoji that Misuzu admires. She reveals that her two swords were part of Kusakabe`s treasures. The swords she has, Onikiri and Kumokiri, in additions to Misuzu`s, were once referred as Kusakabe`s Seven Swords. After she took the two swords and leave her clan, the swords that Misuzu has then become Kusakabe`s Five Treasures. In the game, she looks down on all the \"fragments\" and Kakeru except Shiori because only Shiori is strong enough to fight her. She is also the only member of the Black Knight who is actually alive or living without burden.
