  "description" : "The Phantom Thieves of Hearts are a group of Persona Users led by Amamiya Ren. Sick of the hypocrisy, deception, and corruption around them, they are devoted to stealing the corrupt hearts of those they consider evil people, and in so doing change society for the better. The ethics and morality of what they do has polarised people and society, with some feeling them to be heroes who bring criminals who might be otherwise untouchable to justice, and others feeling that they are criminals themselves who have no right to forcibly change people`s hearts.",
