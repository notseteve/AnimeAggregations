  "description" : "Opera is an adventurous woman who journeys to find her true love, Ernest. Opera, as well as Ernest, are from the planet Tetragenes, and are stranded on Expel. She will go anywhere to find him, just to be near him. Opera is very brave, passionate, and devoted.\nNote: interestingly enough, this character`s name actually has absolutely nothing in common with the similarly called car (the Opel`s \"Vectra\" model, which was produced from 1988 to 2008). Star Ocean EX is an animated adaptation of a video game (\"Star Ocean II: The Second Story\" entry of the famous franchise, to be precise) and this character was planned to be named \"Opera\" right from the very beginning of the development of the said title, quite a few years before anime adaptation was made. The extreme similarity between this character`s name and the car`s model name is purely coincidental due to bad translation.",
