  "description" : "This mass-produced mobile armour is the backbone of the Earth Alliance space forces. In addition to a pair of built-in vulcan cannons, the Moebius can be equipped with a variety of missiles and heavy weapons, and its standard armament is a powerful linear gun capable of destroying an enemy mobile suit or blasting through a warship`s hull armour. However, the overall performance of the Moebius is hopelessly inferior to that of the mobile suits used by ZAFT.",
