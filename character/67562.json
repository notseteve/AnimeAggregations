  "description" : "Miette is a Pofflés Chef that participated in a Pofflés Contest in a town near Shoyo City which she specifically came to and competed against Serena.\nShe could see that Serena liked Ash Ketchum and she wondered if he had a future bride. Ash Ketchum confused by the question stated he didn`t which left the door open for Miette to distract Serena in the contest.\nAfter they couldn`t find any berries for the second round to use as ingredients for their Pofflés, Miette and Serena decided to work together to find some until they managed to find some and defeated Rocket Gang who had been taking them.\nAfter loosing the Pofflés Contest, she said she would continue her journey and keep studying Pofflé making. She also told Serena that if she continued to keep her head in the clouds, she`d steal Ash Ketchum away. The two shook hands and parted ways.\nShe also participated in the Tripokalon in Fujo Town where Serena was also a competitor. Beforehand she told her that she`d settle her score with her and might make a move on Ash Ketchum, too. She won the Pofflé round and advanced to the performance round but ended up loosing to Serena who managed to get the most votes. Despite loosing that day, Miette vowed to win next time and that she hadn`t given up on her competition of gaining Ash Ketchum`s affection either.",
