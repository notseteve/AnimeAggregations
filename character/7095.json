  "description" : "Fine is one of the Twin princesses of Sunny Kingdom. She has red eyes and red hair. She is also referred to as one of \"the most unprincess-like princesses in the history of Fushigi-boshi\". Fine is often afraid of things and whines frequently. Because Fine is a glutton with a love for sweets, she will eat any delicious cake she sees. She is also fairly athletic, but is not very good at dancing, like her sister Rein. Nevertheless, she is very friendly and kind, and cares very much about the people she loves. Fine is always slow on what others are thinking. She was the first one to figure out that Eclipse wasn`t as bad as everyone thought he was, which soon lead her to fall in love with him. Fine usually do whats best for her with out thinking but Rein stops her.",
