During the battle, Paeta was severely injured and forced to give command of the fleet to a staff officer, http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. Yang subsequently led the 2nd Fleet in a successful counterattack, and was able to withdraw from Astarte with minimal casualties. For his actions while in command of the 2nd Fleet, Yang became a national hero.\nThe surviving remainder of the 2nd Fleet was later incorporated into Yang`s 13th Fleet under the order of http://anidb.net/ch750 [Dwight Greenhill].\nSource: Gineipaedia",
