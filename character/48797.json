  "description" : "The Re-Entry Pod is the standard trans-atmospheric carrier craft for the Zentradi mecha forces. Simplistic in design, the Re-Entry ship is one large cargo hold with the craft built around it. It features a single large entrance/egress hatch in the front of the craft and four retracting landing struts. Numerous powerful thrusters are situated all around the craft and the ship is capable of rapid descent from space as well as quick lift off into orbit. These ships were used extensively during Space War I.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/reentry-pod.htm",
