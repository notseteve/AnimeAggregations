  "description" : "Shiftry is the final evolved form of the Seedot species line. Shiftry`s appearance is based on the Tengu of Japanese mythology, with a long nose, white hair, feet resembling Geta sandals, and large fan-like hands being elements based on how Tengu are commonly portrayed. It is a mysterious entity in the Pok√©mon world said to arrive by the chilly winds of Winter, and it is said to be a fearsome guardian of the deep forests it holds sway over from its homes on the tops of toweringly tall trees in dark forests. Its hand fans, which are larger on males than on females, are capable of whipping 100-mph gusts of wind, and it possesses a degree of Extra-sensory perception, able to read its foe`s mind and take preemptive actions most other Pokemon would be unable to do in time. Nuzleaf is a generally strong pokemon but doesnt learn any \"good\" attacks until it reaches a generally high level.",
