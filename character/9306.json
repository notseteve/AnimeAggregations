Despite her claims to have never met Sanpeita before moving to his house, she seems to be somehow familiar to him. She also wears the same bandages on her cheek just like the girl from ten years ago. Another appearance they share in common is their hair color. In eleventh episode of anime her real name - Mei Mishima was revealed. Several characters have seen her before, but none question Sanpeita directly inquiring who she is.",
