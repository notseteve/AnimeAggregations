  "description" : "Bewear is a dual-type Normal/Fighting Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Stufful starting at level 27.\nBewear is a black and pink Pokémon resembling a bear. Its legs and the front of its body are black, while its head, back, and tail are pink. Across the top of its head is a white band with two tufts of fur on each end. This white marking gives it the appearance of wearing a headband with decorative bear ears. It has a short, white muzzle with a triangular black nose. There are pink paw pads on its front paw, and white digital pads on its hind. It has a short tail with dark pink rings.\nWhile Bewear may appear friendly, it is actually a very dangerous Pokémon. It must never be approached carelessly, even if it is merely swinging its arms around in a friendly fashion. It shows affection with a fond embrace, but its hugs have incredible force. Trainers of this Pokémon must teach it how to restrain itself when showing affection.",
