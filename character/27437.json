  "description" : "Shelmet, known as the Snail Pokémon is a Bug-Type Pokémon based on a combination of a giant tube worm or nautilus, and plate armor. Physically, it is a bivalve or snail-like Pokémon, with a gray shell much like that of a knight`s visor although it has a more conventionally snail-like swirl of its shell further back. Shelmet`s shell has protrusions on the underside, which it apparently uses as legs. Its inner body is pink with a long, puckered mouth, and green markings below its eyes.It closes the lid on its helmet-like shell as a defensive tactic, and can spit a poisonous sticky fluid. For some reason, Shelmet evolve when put near an electric line with Karrablast. The name has been derived from the combination of \"shell\" and \"helmet\".",
