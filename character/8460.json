  "description" : "Interpol inspector Zenigata has made it his mission in life to arrest Lupin. He would love to arrest the other members of Lupin`s gang, but Zenigata is really after the mastermind himself. Lupin and Zenigata appear to be the worst of enemies, but they are, in a manner of speaking, friends; something Lupin shows openly (often by greeting Zenigata with mock affection), but it is an idea Zenigata is extremely reluctant to entertain. Similarly, he is often awed by Lupin`s genius, but refuses to show it.",
