  "description" : "Matsuri is a strange girl Yorito meets early on in the story. She is a \"Calamity of the Night\", otherwise known as a Yaka, and has lived for hundreds of years. She cannot come in contact with direct sunlight as it harms her. Matsuri is fascinated by Yorito`s photographs. She has never seen a blue sky, only a deeply cloudy daytime sky or the night-time sky. She has a particular fixed memory of seeing a moonlit sky from some sort of well or hole in the ground. Matsuri does not have much common sense and will often break machines in Yorito`s house after kicking them too hard; she believes that any device can be fixed by kicking it. She has extreme fondness for tomato juice. Her ability is the power to make an object rapidly decay and transform those who have died into Yaka.",
