  "description" : "Golett, also known as the Automaton Pok√©mon, is a species that appears to be based on a golem. On its head, there is a fin-like structure & its both eyes glow in yellow color due the energy inside. It has strap-like objects covering its body, whose center is a blue square with a yellow swirl in the center. It has four large stones, two on its arms and two acting as its feet. It has a strange energy burning inside it, and so far, no one has been able to identify this energy. Its name is a combination of golem & lett, meaning a young golem.\nAccording to the staff of Game Freak, Golett and its evolution were created by James Turner, an American graphic designer.",
