  "description" : "Kinomoto Nadeshiko is the mother of the series titular character, Kinomoto Sakura, who died seven years before the series starts. Only seen in flashbacks, photographs, and as a spirit, Nadeshiko was a high school student and professional model when she met and fell in love with Fujitaka Kinomoto, who was her teacher.\nThough Nadeshiko has died, her love for Fujitaka and her children, and vice versa continues to live on. She frequently visits the family as a winged spirit, though initially only Touya can see her. Throughout the series, she worries over Sakura as the young girl begins gathering the Clow Cards. When the Illusion card tricks Sakura into walking off a cliff, Nadeshiko`s spirit grabs her arm and keeps her from falling until Yukito arrives to catch her. Later in the series, when Sakura develops a high fever, Nadeshiko appears and puts her hand on Sakura`s forehead, lowering the fever.\nThe family is shown to also still love her, most noticeably through a picture kept in the dining area near the kitchen table. Fujitaka changes the picture each morning and Sakura always greets the picture while coming to breakfast.",
