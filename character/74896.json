  "description" : "Tierno`s Raichu is one of the new companions Tierno got after the summer camp ended. Tierno has taught it his rhythm strategy and dance moves. Tierno revealed it when he thought that since Ash Ketchum was going to challenge the Miare Gym, it might be better for him to train with an Electric type as his opponent.\nIt was captured by Team Rocket and shocked the other Pok√©mon in the cage while attempting to escape. After escaping and reuniting Tierno, it participated in a double battle against Pikachu and Ash`s Goodra. It got knocked out by Dragon Pulse.",
