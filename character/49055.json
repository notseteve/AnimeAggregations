  "description" : "The RC-4E Rabbit is a small spacecraft typically used for reconnaissance and light personnel transport. The Rabbit features two large communication antennae and a large sensor mounted on top of the craft as well as four large thrusters of flight and two landing struts likely responsible for the ships name given the resemblance to a rabbit`s feet. The ship is large enough to carry 4-6 passengers (including flight crew) and some small storage for minor equipment. During an unauthorized pleasure flight around Saturn by http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] in Space War I, 1st Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] pursued http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou] in an RC-4E Rabbit to order him back to the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross]. The Zentradi then conducted an operation to capture the two craft and although the Rabbit was initially able to evade, the craft could not outrun the pursuing http://anidb.net/ch49049 [Nousjadeul-Ger] power battle suits over time.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/rabbit.htm",
