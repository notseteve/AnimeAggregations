  "description" : "Formed from the crystallization of all forms of human emotion, Koseki Bijou is \"The Jewel of Emotions.\"\nOver years and years, emotions of beauty and filth alike have woven into her under immense pressure, resulting in an unmatched brilliance.\nHer ancient, mystic brilliance caused strife between the masses of the greedy, who fought over ownership of her. This led to her being imprisoned in secrecy, far from the reach of humans.\nIt seems as though when she encounters people, and particularly their good emotions, her radiance shines even brighter.",
