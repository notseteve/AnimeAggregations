  "description" : "Leina Ashta is Judau Ashta`s younger sister and servers as the driving force and motivation behind most of his actions throughout the series. She grew up with her older brother in the space colony of Shangri-La. The two lived together and alone for much of the time, their father having departed with an unspecified return date. Leina is an essentially reasonable and responsible individual - the exact opposite of her irresponsible older brother. In some ways she even takes care of her older brother, though he does his share for her as well.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
