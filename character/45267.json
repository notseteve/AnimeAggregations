  "description" : "A prototype mobile suit which the Sleeves stole from Anaheim Electronics in U.C. 0094. Its movable frame is partly made from psycho-frame materials, and the improved responsiveness and strength data obtained with this machine was later used to complete the Unicorn Gundam. As the personal machine of Full Frontal, leader of the Sleeves, its overwhelming fighting strength and crimson body remind all those who see it of the famous \"Red Comet.\"",
