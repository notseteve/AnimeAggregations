  "description" : "Graveler resembles a large boulder with four arms and two legs. It lives and feeds on rocky mountains. It will climb the slope of a mountain daily, snacking on small rocks along the way, and roll back down once it has reached the peak. Though it is not very fast when walking, a Graveler rolling down a mountain trail is a very dangerous thing to encounter. Carefree by nature, Graveler ignores most obstacles that may appear in its path, such as grass, trees, boulders or even hikers, since it can roll through or over them more often than not. It is not essentially harmed rolling down the slope, even if the odd jutting piece of its body gets broken off. Machop are known to use Graveler as training weights.",
