He`s intelligent and a quick-thinker, but often loses his cool so he never gets to show off his intellect. He considers Futa Kaminoshima, his childhood friend, as his one true friend while he often ends up quarreling with Yamato Tsubaki. Aoi Wakakusa will be the first one to scold him whenever he messes up in performances. He also gets extremely flustered whenever someone praises him.",
