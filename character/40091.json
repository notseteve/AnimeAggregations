  "description" : "He is Natsume`s father (whether biological or adopted is left in doubt). Early in the warring states era, he helped a http://anidb.net/ch40093 [monk] revive Natsume from her bones using the Hanbon ritual. He also picked up the ritual from the monk and began using it to revive various dead people and animals. Since the original ritual used a mermaid`s liver, Natsume was able to live on, but the products of this man`s revivals all returned to bone within a short while.",
