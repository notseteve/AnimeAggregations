  "description" : "Fura Taishi, as a teenager, attended Seishin Senior Highschool along with http://anidb.net/ch76602 [Arima Kishou]. Though he never liked school, he usually went shopping and did all the housework, since his mother never did. He had two childhood friends; http://anidb.net/ch76472 [Ryou], with whom he played baseball, and http://anidb.net/ch76471 [Aki], a girl whom he had a crush on. When Ryou associated himself with a gang of bikers, this led to his death, as he was stabbed by the Kagune of a killer Ghoul, Lantern, whom Arima was currently investigating. Witnessing his friend`s tragic death, Fura grew heated for vengeance, and pleaded with Arima to help with his investigation, wanting to know about ghouls right away. Thus, he eventually undertook the career of Ghoul Investigation.\nSource: Wikipedia",
