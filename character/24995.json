  "description" : "Falco is the original Fang King and a Gravity Child. He is originally a slim and slender blond, who wears a fine suit and bowler hat. He is capable of firing several \"solid\" Fangs simultaneously without injury. He quits after the destruction of Sleeping Forest and becomes a weak visual novel playing old man with a pot belly. Falco holds the Gram Scale Tournament`s \"Eternal Seed\", meaning he always has a reserved spot in the tournament as the team \"Inorganic Net\". Inorganic Net is a digital copy of the original Sleeping Forest within a computer. He also has the authority to give his spot to others, given they`re capable of defeating Inorganic Net. Falco was responsible for the protection of Skylink (for an unknown duration of time), which is a component of the Sky Regalia.",
