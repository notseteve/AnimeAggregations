  "description" : "Uchikoma is a green 1-man tank (walker/roller) briefly used by members of http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9] in the TV Anime http://anidb.net/a4414 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. Solid State Society]\nAt the end of the TV series http://anidb.net/a1176 [Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG] the http://anidb.net/ch9577 [Tachikomas] sacrifice their AI`s in order to prevent a nuclear detonation. They are replaced by Fuchikoma/Tachikoma hybrids, referred to as Uchikomas, similar to the Fuchikoma think-tanks used in the original Ghost In The Shell manga.\n\"Uchikoma\" is the correct pronunciation, as clearly indicated in Japanese literature dealing with the subject, where they are referred to as Uchikoma. The subtitles on volume 7 of the Region 1 DVDs, released by Bandai Entertainment, unmistakably call the new think-tanks \"Fuchikoma\", which is incorrect. The packaging art for the model kit, however, clearly labels the units \"Uchikoma\".",
