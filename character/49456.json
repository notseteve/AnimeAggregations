  "description" : "With each new class of variable fighter the UN Spacy has found it useful to assign modified variants to team leaders and flight commanders. The VF-19S is a variant built in line with that official doctrine and features several improvements from the standard Excalibur model. A new head unit was built to replace the standard \"F\" series model, but in addition to the standard central beam gun the VF-19S features four additional fixed anti-aircraft laser cannons mounted on the sides of the head turret. The VF-19S weighs slightly more than the standard model Excalibur (8.62 metric tons) but more than offsets the little additional weight with significantly improved engines. Two Shinsei Industry/P&W/Roice FF-2550J engines provide the VF-19S with 12,900 kg [x g] more thrust. The VF-19S, like the VF-19F, appears in standard blue mass production colors but the \"S\" model includes gold highlights unlike the \"F\" model silver highlights. Second Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch43874 [Docker] of Emerald Force was noted for flying a VF-19S during the Protodeviln War in 2045-2046.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/vf-19s.htm",
