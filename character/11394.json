  "description" : "Barret Wallace is a playable character in Final Fantasy VII. He is the leader of an eco-terrorist group called AVALANCHE, trying to prevent Shinra from using Mako, the Planet`s life source, as a form of energy. However, his seemingly benevolent cause of fighting for the Planet is a cover for his true personal vendetta and anger, which he later must come to terms with. Despite his brash and sometimes violent attitude, Barret has a good heart, and is torn between fighting and caring for his adopted daughter Marlene.\nSource: http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Barret_Wallace",
