  "description" : "Tobi is a Dragon Knight who mastered the technical side of the future timespace. Although weak in combat, Tobi proven to be an invaluable member of the knights. She was one of the Dragon Knights who left La`cryma with Atori, but allied with Karasu. Tobi remained in our timeline and eventually faded away once the danger ended. Tobi has not shown any spin weapons, though it is assumed she has one. Tobi is Japanese for kite. Tobi is quite petite, most likely the youngest of the Dragon Knights, and has relatively dark skin. She is adorned by purple hair worn in a style similar to a bowl-cut, though at both sides in the back it is tied into short braids bound by what appear to be wide, tight-bound rubber bands, or some form of clasp or ribbon. She has brown eyes with nearly stick-straight eyelids, resulting in a somewhat feline appearance.",
