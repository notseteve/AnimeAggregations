  "description" : "Shelgon cells are continually changing to prepare for evolution into Salamence. Even though this Pok√©mon`s shell is heavy, it makes up for it by drawing in its stubby legs and rolling around. This shell is very thick and strong, similar to bones. The shell protects disruption of its internal cell development. When it is finally ready for evolution, its shell sheds instantly. While in this stage of its evolution, Shelgon fasts in order to grow hardier from hunger. It grows tired easily due to its lack of food and its heavy shell weighing it down.",
