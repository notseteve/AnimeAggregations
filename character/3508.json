  "description" : "The seventeen-year-old Death Scythe in charge of Europe. Dressed in a priestly garb, Justin is devout in his services to the Shinigami. Justin is the youngest in Shibusen`s history to become a Death Scythe, which he achieved at the age of thirteen. He did all of this without the aid of a partner. His weapon form, the guillotine, fits his title of \"executioner\". Justin has the ability to read lips, but due to his constant usage of earphones and Shinigami wearing a mask, he cannot understand Shinigami. He tends to pray and give thanks to his god, Shinigami, for everything, and also tends to speak loudly due to his constant use of headphones. He travels by means of a dune buggy with a coffin on wheels connected to it. He is coloured with blonde hair and he is wearing an ecclesiastical hat, usually worn by monks from European churches.",
