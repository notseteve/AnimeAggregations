  "description" : "Orange League Final - Vs. Ash Ketchum (Rocky Field)\nAfter Gengar confused Tauros Ash quickly recalls Tauros and sends out Lapras in the water pool in the middle of the stage.\nLapras goes underwater to dodge Gengar`s initial attack and then resurfaced to shoot a water gun directly at Gengar who only manage to get out of the way after taking some damage. Gengar shoots Night Shade at Lapras who counter attacks with Ice Beam, the two attacks collide with each other and the resulting explosion eliminate both Pokémon which meant Drake has lost three Pokémon and Ash had only lost one.\nAfter Ash had won the battle against Drake he called out all of his Pokémon that participated in the battle on the stage as Drake presented him with the Winner`s Trophy. Then Ash, Pikachu, Tauros, Lapras, Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charizard all had their handprints set in stone to be remembered in the Orange Island Hall of Fame.",
