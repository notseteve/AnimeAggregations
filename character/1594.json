  "description" : "This nation is the dominant power in the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance], and the creator of the http://anidb.net/ch1507 [Archangel] and the prototype Gundams. Before the war, the Atlantic Federation was the most influential of the sponsor nations which funded the construction of the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs] and then forced their Coordinator inhabitants into economic bondage. When the leadership of the United Nations was wiped out by a terror attack at the lunar city of Copernicus, the Atlantic Federation took the lead in organizing the http://anidb.net/ch1542 [Earth Alliance] and issuing a declaration of war against the http://anidb.net/ch1571 [PLANTs].\nThe Atlantic Federation was originally formed from the nations of Britain and North America. At the beginning of the first war it expanded its territory by annexing the http://anidb.net/ch1601 [United States of South America], but this conquest is eventually undone when the Junius Treaty restores South America`s independence.\nDuring the first war the Atlantic Federation`s major military base, the JOSH-A facility in Alaska, doubles as the headquarters of the Earth Alliance forces. After the destruction of JOSH-A, its functions are transferred to Heavens Base in Iceland.",
