  "description" : "A Catholic witch hunter who thinks that Haruo was sent from heaven and needs protection from witches (especially Ayumi). She works with Ayumi, Yuri, and/or Maika when she feels that they have a common cause. Marin is an incompetent and clumsy fool who injures herself more in her attacks than any of the \"evil-witches\" that she so adamantly hunts. It`s unclear whether Marin has deeper feelings for Haruo, or if she just admires him for what she calls \"keeping away evil witches\". Marin has never purified any other witches (if you don`t count the witch she purified in Michiru`s world).",
