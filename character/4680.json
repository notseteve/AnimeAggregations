  "description" : "Asuna Kagurazaka`s mouth may be big, but her attitude is bigger. A quick tempered redhead with a tough exterior, Asuna`s brash personality serves her well in her constant struggles with her class rival, Ayaka. Asuna usually reserves her softer side for the unrequited longings she expresses toward Professor Takahata, her former teacher. It doesn`t sit well when the manly object of her affection is replaced with a new instructor! Little Negi Springfield. Her misfortunes seem to stack up when the kid is around, and her hostility and suspicion toward the brainy boy lead her to a startling discovery! She soon finds Negi`s destiny in her hands. Will she take the steps to make the magician to disappear?",
