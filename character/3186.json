  "description" : "A beautiful maid, also assigned to the Fujiwara household. She is tasked with both the Fujiwara`s daily care, and keeping Kogarashi under control. She has great skill as a maid and guardian, demonstrating ninja-like abilities. Fubuki is usually serious and calm, but isn`t above flattery and can be prideful at times. Both in the manga and anime, she is quite reserved about showing her attractive body and will quickly punish Kogarashi for his antics with a nail-studded baseball bat or kunai... or any other weapon she carries in her arsenal.",
