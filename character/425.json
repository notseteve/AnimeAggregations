  "description" : "An African-American soldier stationed in Japan at Misawa Air Base, near Hachinohe, Ozuma proves a difficult opponent for Ippo in the first round of the Rookie King Tournament. While fearsome in fights, Ozuma`s usual personality is almost unnervingly polite and outgoing. He boxes in order to earn money for his gym, his coach and his training partners, whom he treats like his own family. Ozuma wields an explosive hook equal even to, if not better than, Takamura`s.",
