  "description" : "Marianne vi Britannia is the fifth wife of the Emperor of Britannia and the mother of Lelouch and Nunnally, titled the 98th Empress of the Holy Britannian Empire. She is nicknamed \"Marianne the Flash\" for her piloting skills, having been the test pilot for the Ganymede Knightmare Frame with the support of the Ashford Foundation, which was then a contender in the development of the first Knightmare Frame prototypes. Bismarck Waldstein claims that the only person he had to use his Geass against before Suzaku was Marianne, which shows that she must have been particularly skilled. When Lelouch was a child, she was assassinated within the Aries Palace, purportedly by terrorists, and the culprits were never found. The fact that the impenetrable security of the palace was powerless is what convinced Lelouch that her murder was no random act of terrorism.",
