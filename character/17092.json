  "description" : "This mini-version of http://anidb.net/ch1656 [Sadaharu] is the defending Inugami aka Dog God, while http://anidb.net/ch1656 [Sadaharu] is the attacking counterpart. When `awakened`, has the ability to transform into a strong ferocious single-horned version just like http://anidb.net/ch1656 [Sadaharu] but still maintaining its mini size. Its eyebrows are typically upside down in relation to http://anidb.net/ch1656 [Sadaharu]`s, although when http://anidb.net/ch1656 [Sadaharu] gets mad, its eyebrows have been known to look like Komako`s.",
