  "description" : "Very little is known about Kortopi. Exceptionally short in stature, he also has a thick and messy mane of hair covering his entire head, obscuring everything except for an occasional glimpse of his left eyeball. He is the weakest in the Troupe in terms of raw physical power. In fact, his Nen abilities so far suggest that he is not involved in combat at all, but rather theft and subterfuge. His Nen ability is called \"Gallery Fake: Divine Left Hand, Demonic Right Hand\", which allows him to make perfect copies of any object by touching it with his left hand and producing the copy with his right. The size of the object doesn`t matter. He can also make copies of living humans, but they`ll be immobile and lifeless. He`s also able to know the exact location of any copy he has created by touching the original object. The copies vanish after 24 hours have passed.\nNen type: Conjuration\nSource: Wiki",
