  "description" : "The engineer and creator of Wing Gundam and Heero`s mentor, he is an expert in the field of beam weaponry. His distinguishing features include mechanical-looking goggles and a cybernetic right arm. Quirky but affable, Doctor J is immensely proud of Heero`s abilities and encourages the young man to choose his own fate, including protecting Darlian and rejecting Operation Meteor. It was J who chose Heero`s codename, which he thinks is highly appropriate.",
