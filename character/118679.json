  "description" : "O-Taku is God`s younger brother, thus following him around most of the time, yet it is hinted that he does not concur with the majority of his actions. When idle, he is mostly seen playing videogames on his handheld. Takes a liking in O-Jou and thus dislikes Beso. Although he`s not a principally bad person, he doesn`t really follow altruistic motives either.\nSource: Wikipedia",
