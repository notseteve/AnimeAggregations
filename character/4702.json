  "description" : "The prankster twins Fuka and Fumika are some of the smallest and, frankly, most immature girls in 2-A. Their youthful nature might be the reason that the duo get along with Negi so well. After setting a booby trap on Springfield`s first day as a teacher, the Narutaki twins set quite a precedent of unpredictability for the lad. Fans of loooooong campus tours as members of Mahora`s Walking Club, you can often find the twins goofing around with their friend Kaede. Fumika tends to go along with her older and more outspoken sister Fuka`s plans, but make no mistake! Both of these girls are capable of trouble!",
