In the manga and both animes Alexander and Nina grow very close to the Elric brothers, but their friendship was not able to last as http://anidb.net/ch10887 [Shou Tucker] needed to present an astounding alchemic breakthrough to the military or have his license revoked, so in order to keep it he transmutes Alexander and Nina together to create a talking (yet imperfect) Chimera, when the Elric brothers discover this Edward beats Shou to near death for having done such a cruel thing. With no idea on how to restore Nina and Alexander the brothers leave the rest in the hands of the military, but the State Alchemist killer http://anidb.net/ch6593 [Scar] soon arrives and kills Shou Tucker and once he sees the http://anidb.net/ch10892 [Nina/Alexander chimera] he notices the pain the creature is in and kills it in an act of mercy.",
