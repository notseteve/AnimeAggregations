  "description" : "Elle`s Fennekin evolved into Elle`s Braixen while changing from a PokéVision creator to a Pokémon Performer. It has quickly become a major player. Elle still regularly uploads PokéVisions though despite participating in the tournaments. At the time of the Pokémon Summer Camp, Elle held the title of \"Kalos Queen\" as she had won each tournament three or more times and had entered the Master Class. Elle`s Braixen was seen at the award ceremony with her.",
