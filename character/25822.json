  "description" : "Kirigakure Shura is an Upper First Class Exorcist and Rin`s mentor. She trained under the guidance of Fujimoto Shiro to obtain the title \"Meister\" in Knight and can draw a demon sword from a symbol above her chest when she states \"Devour the Seven Princesses, slay the Serpent\". Frequently chipper and obnoxious, Shura is carefree about her job, known for drinking and oversleeping. She appears to harbor a dark past, as she claimed Shiro \"came and rescued\" her.",
