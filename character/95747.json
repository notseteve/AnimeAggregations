It was tasked with eliminating any ghouls fleeing through the underground tunnels and defeating the Non-Killing Owl in case it penetrated from underground. The squad made its first appearance before the final battle against the One-Eyed Owl during the conclusion of the Owl Suppression operation. The squad would later appear during the Auction Sweep operation as part of the S3 Squad.\nSource: Tokyo Ghoul Wiki",
