  "description" : "Kanoe Yuuko is the ghost of a girl who died in Seikyou Private School fifty years ago under mysterious circumstances. She is responsible for many (but apparently not all) of the many supernatural incidents that have been taking place within the school ever since. She is mischievous and enjoys playing tricks on people, and seems to have taken a liking to Niiya Teiichi, the first person in some time who is actually able to see and touch her, and is jealous when other girls try to get close to him. She founded the Paranormal Investigations Club to learn more about the mysteries surrounding herself.",
