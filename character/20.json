  "description" : "Ivysaur is known as the Seed Pok√©mon. While almost the same as Bulbasaur the bulb on its back has grown. Having grown much larger, the bulb forces their legs to become stronger and thicker to accommodate the weight, and makes it harder for them to stand on their hind legs. Both the Ivysaur and the bulb grow stronger and larger from sunlight. When the bulb is ready to bloom, they will spend more time lying in sunlight, and the bulb will give off a sweet scent.",
