  "description" : "Bernhard von Schneider was an Imperial commander who was most notable for his role as the leading adjutant, subordinate, and a close confidant of High Admiral http://anidb.net/ch202 [Willibald Joachim von Merkatz], serving him faithfully from at least the Battle of Astarte (796 UC) to the Battle of Shiva (801 UC). During the late Allianceâ€“Imperial War, the Imperial Civil War, and the following standoff between the New Galactic Empire and the http://anidb.net/ch6227 [Iserlohn Republic], Schneider was essentially apolitical and was mainly loyal to High Admiral Merkatz, providing him with assistance and counseling.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
