  "description" : "Kaede is http://anidb.net/ch10909 [Kikyou]`s younger sister and assists her with various tasks such as gathering herbs or holding her arrows. After Kikyou`s death, Kaede becomes a miko in her own right and defends the village against demons. When Kagome arrives, Kaede recognizes her as the reincarnation of Kikyo. After Kagome frees InuYasha, Kaede puts the \"Beads of Subjugation\" onto him to give Kagome the power to control him with a spoken word. Kaede is well-respected and held in high regards by the villagers and the members of InuYasha`s group, which she often advises about demons and other spiritual anomalies. Though InuYasha is easily annoyed with her, he listens to her when necessary and doesn`t hesitate to protect her from a threat.\nKaede loses an eye sometime during her life. In the manga, her eye appears to be freshly bandaged and bleeding shortly before Kikyo`s death, suggesting that the wound occurs when \"InuYasha\" (really http://anidb.net/ch11091 [Naraku] in disguise) attacks the village to steal the Shikon Jewel; supplementary information states that she \"lost her elder sister and her eye in an incident fifty years ago.\" The anime simply says that she lost it during a demon attack on the village.",
