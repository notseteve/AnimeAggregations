  "description" : "The girl who works as a `B-Cuber`, an online video streamer. Her videos are badly rated and viewer count is sluggish. She is an adventurer registered in the guild but was rather reclusive up until recently, playing video games at home. While her online rank is low, she boasts high shooting skills because of her excellent kinetic visual acuity acquired through these games. If you give her a gun, she will easily decide things with a headshot.\nSource: Official page",
