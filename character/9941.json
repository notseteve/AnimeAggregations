  "description" : "Queen of the Kendappa tribe in the east, Kendappa-Ou is the royal musician. Despite her favoured position at Taishakuten`s court, she hid Souma in her flying castle after her tribe was wiped out and also helped Yasha-Ou and Ashura when they passed through her kingdom. However, she does not believe that the Six Stars can triumph over Taishakuten, who she says is the strongest person in Heaven. Instead of allying herself with her friends, she reveals herself to be one of Taishakuten`s shitennou, Jikokuten, the shitennou and bushinshou of the East - a position her father had held before being killed by Taishakuten. Impressed with Taishakuten`s strength, the only trait which she admires, she swore herself to his service when she was just a small child. Her harp, her constant companion, serves also as the hiding place for her sword.\nUnable to go back on her word, believing that all of the Six Stars will be killed anyway, she decides to kill Souma, whom she is in love with, herself. She commits suicide right after, saying there is no point in living in Heaven without her.",
