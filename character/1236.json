  "description" : "Skorupi is the pre-evolved form of Drapion, and unlike its adult form is a Bug/Poison type. Skorupi seems to resemble a standard scorpion, only with 4 legs, instead of 8. Its tail is used for gripping prey and injecting poison into them. It ambushes prey by hiding in the sand and waiting patiently.\nSkorupi has 2 abilities: Battle Armor, preventing critical hits on Skorupi, and Sniper (a newer ability) , which triples the damage of an attack instead of doubling it during the case of a critical hit. The only place you can get some Skorupi is in the Safari Zone.",
