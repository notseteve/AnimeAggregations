  "description" : "Sakaguchi is the owner of the kendo equipment shop that Kojirou takes his kendo team to for purchasing equipment. While Sakaguchi`s kendo skills are only seen in a series of flashbacks in the anime, it is apparent that he is incredibly skilled at kendo, strong enough to make all of the members of Kojirou`s team complain about him. He has a fondness for mochi, although Kojirou`s kendo team tends to eat all of Sakaguchi`s mochi during their visits to his shop. He is also, as Kojirou puts it, \"very competitive\".\nSource: wiki",
