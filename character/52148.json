  "description" : "Diana is the top student of Luna Nova who is greatly admired by her classmates and teachers alike. She is always surrounded by her two biggest fans, http://anidb.net/ch54621 [Hanna] and http://anidb.net/ch54620 [Barbara].\nHailing from Great Britain as daughter of a noble family of witches, she has a serious and arrogant nature and oftentimes clashes with http://anidb.net/ch52146 [Akko], whom she holds in disdain for her impulsive nature and admiration of http://anidb.net/ch53389 [Shiny Chariot]. Despite this, Diana is secretly a childhood fan of Chariot herself, and gradually develops a grudging respect for Akko.\nSource: Wikipedia",
