He aspired to imitate the works of Ogata Kenzan, a famous potter from the Edo period. He has a younger sister, http://anidb.net/ch148745 [Rin].\nBecause he was very skilled his works catched the eye of some swindlers who coerced him into making counterfeit Kenzan pottery by threatening to hurt his little sister. He did so for a time but then left Kanagawa, where he lived, and came to hide in Tokyo. There he was again found by the same criminals and only with the help of Souichirou and his brother http://anidb.net/ch145958 [Reijirou], http://anidb.net/ch145181 [Chuuzenji Akihiko], http://anidb.net/ch145957 [Kiba Shuutarou] and http://anidb.net/ch148744 [Imagawa Masasumi] was he able to finally leave his past behind him.
