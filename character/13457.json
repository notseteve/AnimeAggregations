  "description" : "Nicknamed Tama, he is the turtle given to Keitarou by Mutsumi. Keitarou points out that the turtle is male, but the girls are convinced he is a `she` and so `he` is referred to as `she` throughout the manga. She is an `onsen kame` or hot-springs turtle, and like others of her species, it appears that she can fly. Su, Mutsumi, Seta, and (later in the series) Keitarou appear to have the ability to speak with Tama-chan, and Su occasionally develops the urge to eat her, though sometimes it is just to tease Shinobu (in the manga, it is said on a side note that Su drops this habit in order to wait for Tama-chan to reproduce). She appears in Negima on Chizuru Naba`s apron on the back cover of volume 8, in chapter 85 of volume 10, and in other places as pictures.",
