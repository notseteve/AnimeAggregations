  "description" : "Spiritomb, along with Sableye, shares the distinction of being one of only two Pokémon with no weakness. Since it is a combination Ghost/Dark type, no attack is \"super effective\" against it under normal circumstances. In addition, both Spiritomb and Sableye are, due to their typing, completely immune to Counter and Mirror Coat (unless moves such as Foresight or Miracle Eye are used), but not Metal Burst. Moves like Foresight and the ability Scrappy can negate its immunity to Fighting and Normal, allowing opponents to hit the Fighting weakness of its Dark typing. Its ability, Pressure, doubles the PP cost of any moves used by a foe. This ability, combined with its resistances and wide movepool of defensive moves, makes it a highly effective \"tank\".\nAccording to its Pokédex entry, Spiritomb is a single entity composed of 108 evil spirits. Spiritomb has a strange connection to the number 108, being 108 kilograms (238.1 lbs.), #108 in the Sinnoh Pokedex, and having 108 as its base stat in defense and special defense. The number 108 is sacred in Hinduism and Buddhism. The entry also mentions that it was bound to a fissure in an Odd Keystone as punishment for misdeeds done 500 years ago. Also, if you take the difference between Spiritomb`s level-up moves (6), and multiply it by the total number of moves it can learn through level-up and egg moves (not counting repeats, 18), you get 108.\nChampion Cynthia of the Sinnoh Pokémon League uses a Spiritomb in her team. It is level 61.",
