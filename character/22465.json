  "description" : "Cissy sent out her Blastoise at the beginning of her second challenge, the Pokémon Wave Ride race but just as she did Team Rocket appeared and captured it in their net. Cissy`s Blastoise proved to be too strong for Team Rocket though as it broke out of their net and then used Hydro Pump to send them blasting off again.\nBlastoise proved that it was also a fast swimmer and a strong Pokémon during the Pokémon Wave Ride race against Ash`s Lapras. It bashed Ash`s Lapras quite a few times but it wasn`t able to completely stop it. It managed to make it around the flag first but on the home stretch Ash`s Lapras managed to use an Ice Beam to freeze the water so it could go faster and win the race. Cissy`s Blastoise barely lost though as Ash`s Lapras won by half a stroke.",
