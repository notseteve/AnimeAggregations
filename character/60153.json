  "description" : "Yukiya`s Golurk participated in the that participated in the Pokémon Sumo which was part of the festival on Harvest Island that celebrates the harvest of fruit. Since no Pokémon attacks could be used in the tournament, its sheer size gave it an enormous advantage. During the Pokémon Sumo, Yukiya`s Golurk was first matched up against Meowth who was dressed up in a Golonya costume. The match only lasted one move which sent Team Rocket flying into the sky. Yukiya`s Golurk made it to the finals where it was matched up against Ash`s Pignite. Yukiya thought he could easily defeat Ash`s Pignite, but its agile moves proved to be too much for Yukiya`s Golurk and Ash defeated Yukiya to win the Pokémon Sumo. Since Pokémon attacks were banned from the competition, none of Yukiya`s Golurk moves are confirmed.",
