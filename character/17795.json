  "description" : "Lestrade-keibu is http://anidb.net/ch17793 [Holmes]` go-to guy in the police force, and also the first to call on Holmes for assistance on a case. Though he is a well-meaning and passionate police officer, he`s not the most attentive of people, and he also has a hotheaded and impulsive nature as well. He is usually assisted by several policemen in trying to catch and arrest http://anidb.net/ch17794 [Moriarty], but they always fail at trying to catch him and they seem to always end up landing themselves into comedic situations.\nSource: Wikipedia",
