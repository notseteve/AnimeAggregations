  "description" : "Iris is the waitress at Clyde`s bar with unrealized romantic interests in Gene. Their relationship is comically unconsummated, very similar to that between Moneypenny and James Bond: although he is never involved with her, Gene is not above flirting with Iris and occasionally rubbing her rear end (this was cut from Cartoon Network airings). Likewise, Iris has feelings of envy when she sees Gene with other women, such as Hilda or Melfina. Her last appearance in the series is in the final episode, when she goes to the spaceport with Clyde to say goodbye to Gene before he sets off into space once more.",
