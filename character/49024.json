  "description" : "During development of OverTechnology gained via research of the fallen Alien Space Ship-1, the U.N. Government decided to attempt incorporating early discoveries into existing human technology. Destroids and variable fighters were still several years away from being realized so the new technologies developed by the OTEC research institute would be used to build a fighter called the F-203 Dragon II. The F-203 began design only a year and a half after the establishment of OTEC and was formally adopted as the main fighter of the U.N. Forces in 2003. Built as a delta wing aircraft with OverTechnology, the F-203 was stronger, faster and more efficient than previous fighter aircraft. The craft was much more maneuverable than conventional fighter aircraft and was light despite equipment for V/STOL capabilities. http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] flew an F-203 during his service as a fighter pilot in the United Nations Wars.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/dragonii.htm",
