  "description" : "A Titan pilot distinguished by his superb fighting skills and sheer aggression. Yazan joins the crew of the Titan cruiser Alexandria around the time of the attack on Von Braun City and becomes the ship`s resident ace pilot, eclipsing the hapless Jerid Messa. Brutal and bloodthirsty, he lives for the thrill of the hunt, and despises cautious commanders who try to spoil his fun. He`s later joined by a pair of equally cunning and sadistic wingmen, Ensigns Dunkel Cooper and Ramsus Hasa.\nSource: Official Site",
