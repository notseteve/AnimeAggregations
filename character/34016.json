  "description" : "Hinaga Rieko is an elderly woman living in the countryside where Keima`s grandparents also live. While visiting his grandparents to celebrate the Obon festival with the rest of the Katsuragi family, Keima and Elsie meets Rieko and her granddaughter Airi, a little girl who speaks very scary things. At first, Keima and Elsie believes Airi has a spirit inside of her after seeing a ghost-like apparition of her appearing at the village cemetery at night but upon further investigating, Keima learns the apparition is actually Rieko due to the fact she looks similarly to her granddaughter when she was younger. As he meets Rieko at the cemetery, Elsie talks to the spirit possessing Rieko`s body and convinces it to leave and surrender as Rieko is too old to bear children. At the cemetery, Rieko`s apparition, now in a form when she was a teenager, explains to Keima the gap in heart was because she feels lonely and misses her family and friends who are either old, have left or passed away. However both she and Keima agrees that she was able to live a long and happy life before her apparition departs. In aftermath, Keima explains while she is no longer possessed by a spirit, the gap in Rieko`s heart remains but she has accepted it and moved on with her life just like his grandparents.\nThe cause of Rieko`s negative emotions was her loneliness being without her loved ones and a wish of a return to the time of her youth.\nHer surname is derived from Hinaga Station (日永駅, Hinaga-eki).",
