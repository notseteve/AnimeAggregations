  "description" : "Servine, a Grass Snake Pok√©mon, is the evolution of Snivy. Servine resembles a grass snake, and its appearance is very similar to Snivy except its back is grown by three palmate leaves with three prongs each. During a battle, it can run as if gliding from the ground that may bewilder its enemies. It evades attack by passing overgrown plants and then whipping the foe quickly.\nIn the anime, a Servine is first seen battling against a Dewott in one of the Battle Clubs in the Unova region. Trip`s Snivy was revealed to have evolved into a Servine some time before Trip`s second battle against Ash Ketchum.",
