  "description" : "Shizuku is a Mizuchi (Water dragon demon) in the form of a black, short-haired small girl with snake tongue that can stretch rather far, similar to that of a chameleon, and can breath underwater. Shuzuku usually has a stoic expression, and is almost always completely soaked with water. Shuzuku`s entire family was killed by demon slayers, giving her somewhat of a grudge against them. She first meets Yuuto at a river, where she warns Yuuto that if he continues to go along with his demon slayer heritage, she would kill him. To make sure of this she invites herself to live in Yuto`s house and starts to like him romantically. On numerous occasions takes opportunities to flirt with him in front of others. After meeting one of the descendants of the now extinct Jibashiri demon slayers that killed her family and intervention by Yuuto, she finally lets go of her grudge. She often ends her sentence with nano (なの).\nHer ability, beside doing house chores, is to manipulate water and use it as weapon or medium, even healing Yuuto wounds. She can revive her body after being sliced into two and is a very strong opponent around environments with plenty of water. As a drawback, she is extremely sensitive to heat.",
