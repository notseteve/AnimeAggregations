  "description" : "Sometime in the past, Doma and his crew surrendered to Ace after he defeated them.\nDoma and his crew are first seen, along with a fleet of 42 other infamous pirate crews, allied with the Whitebeard Pirates, attacking Marineford to save Portgas D. Ace from his execution. When Whitebeard decided to attack personally, he is seen holding his sword, ready to fight alongside his \"father\".\nHe has recently been shown in combat during the war against the marines. He wields two swords while his pet monkey that clings onto his neck wields a pistol, helping him in combat. He`s later seen among the group of New World captains who were backing up Luffy and Ivankov on Whitebeard`s orders.\nWhen the Blackbeard Pirates launched a barrage of bullets and blades at Whitebeard and killing him with it, Doma was seen crying. Later, when Shanks arrived, Doma was seen showing shock and unease. ",
