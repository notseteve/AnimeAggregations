  "description" : "Sagi is a little boy who appears in the room where Dead Peppers grew in Herba`s Mansion. He actually turns out to be the manifestation of a Sagiso Flower that Lisa had raised as a child and was forced to leave when she moved to her mother`s home, with Lisa feeling guilty for not recognizing Sagi until it was too late. In the language of flowers, the Sagiso means \"my thoughts will follow you into your dreams\".",
