In the past, he led team http://anidb.net/ch89129 [Excellent Era] to three consecutive titles as League Champions and was honored with the title of MVP three times as well. He won the title of Rising Star twice, and One Hit One Kill and King of Dueling once.\nThe team Excellent Era manager made him leave the club after they found a replacement for Ye Xiu. As a collateral, he was forced to retire from his professional gaming career. Shortly after that, he found a job at Happy Internet Cafe, where he worked as a manager. Possessing over 10 years of experience in Glory, he threw himself into the newly opened 10th server. With his past memories and an incomplete self-made weapon, he once again began his journey back to the top.\nSource: Gravity Tales, edited.",
