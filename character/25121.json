  "description" : "Meruru is the main character in Kirino`s favorite anime Stardust Witch Meruru. This metafictional anime seems to be a pastiche of the various clich√©s prevalent in the magical girl genre. She is voiced by Tamura Yukari, who, not coincidentally, also voices Kirino`s friend Kurusu Kanako.",
