  "description" : "Zangoose, although a quadruped, can easily stand on two feet when angered in battle. Zangoose`s main means of defense are its agility and its sharp claws. Its speed is matched only by Scyther`s. Many of the attacks a Zangoose learns naturally involve the use of its claws. The characteristic a Zangoose is most famous for is its relationship with Seviper. Simply put, the two species are mortal enemies. The hatred a Zangoose holds for a Seviper is deep and goes so far back that it is practically instinctive.\nThe Zangoose is a big, white, catlike creature with huge claws - purple or black, depending on the artist - and tufts of hair pointing back from the head instead of ears. It is, as said before, a milk white - except for the red markings on its fur.",
