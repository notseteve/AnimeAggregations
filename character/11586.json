  "description" : "Aine is shown to have once been a living girl like Misao. She is Reiko and Reishirou`s cousin. While waiting on a ship for Reishirou, the ship was attacked by a demonic being. Reishirou was able to save Reiko, but Aine was horifically impaled by shrapnel from the ship. In order to protect her spirit, Reishirou used the Extractor to use her as the Burial Doll for his Asura Machina, Hisui. Aine now appears in ghost form in a snow flake decorated costume.\n(1st Stage)\nA member of the Homemaking Club. Tuna Rider.",
