  "description" : "Hayashi Tadaaki is the coach for the http://anidb.net/ch37969 [Seimei High School] kendo team. He is extremely strict with his students, and verbally and physically punishes them when they lose a match, even if it is against a stronger opponent. His tough training regimen often causes students to quit the kendo team, although he does not regret this, and considers quitters to be weak. After the practice with Muroe High, however, he seems to be willing to take it just a little bit easier on his wards.",
