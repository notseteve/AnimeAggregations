  "description" : "The previous successor to the Hokuto Shinken style. Ryuuken was the sifu who adopted and trained Raou, Toki, Jagi, and Kenshirou in the Hokuto Shinken style.\nAfter he chose Kenshirou as his successor, he was slain by Raou, a feat made possible by chance; he suffered a stroke at the moment he was about to seal Raou`s fist. Kenshirou did not know the real cause of Ryuuken`s death, having been told that Ryuuken died from illness, until Toki revealed the shameful secret during their first battle.\nBoth Kenshirou and Raou reflect on Ryuuken`s teachings during difficult situations.",
