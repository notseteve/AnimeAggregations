Katz now feels he`s old enough to follow in the footsteps of his childhood heroes, and after helping Amuro escape Federation surveillance and join the resistance fighters, Katz makes his way into space to fight alongside the AEUG. Like his foster father Hayato, Katz is impulsive and reckless, not to mention dangerously naive.\nSource: Official Site",
