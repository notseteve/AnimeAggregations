  "description" : "Silver Knight is second-in-command of the Crimson Knights. As described by Frank Ellis he possesses a strong sense of justice (becoming overzealous at times), but is extremely naive, leading him to end up as more of a tool to be used by whoever is in control. He is extremely overprotective of Subaru. Silver Knight`s PC is an edited version of the standard Crimson Knight design.\nLater in the series, he tells Mimiru that he is 23 and works in a video store.",
