  "description" : "AZ is a man who was born almost 3,000 years ago. In the games, he owned a Floette during a fierce war between two nations. Because these nations believed powerful Pokemon was needed to win the war, they drafted AZ`s Floette, and forced it out to war without his permission. His Floette died, and the body was returned to him. In grief, and wanting to see his Floette again, he created \"The Ultimate Weapon\". This weapon worked like Yveltal, it drained a lot of life energy to bring back one life. It killed many people and Pokemon and ended the war. His Floette was disgusted by the sacrifice it took to bring her back though, and left him. Because of the Ultimate Weapon`s power, both his Floette and him have been cursed with immortality.",
