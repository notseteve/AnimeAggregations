  "description" : "Orphen is the main male lead. Fans claim \"he comes off as a `badass` kind of guy\", because of his apparent lack of emotions, dedication to finish what he is working on as soon as possible (his eagerness to stop helping people he feels he doesn`t have to help), and his `coldness` towards people he doesn`t know. He is partly an anti-hero throughout the entire series. The only time his attitude changes is when the subject of Azalie is brought up. He will do anything for Azalie, as when they were younger, she had tutored him and gave him the confidence to get as far as he did in the Tower of Fangs. He and Azalie were brought to the school because it was believed that they possessed a strong amount of magical power within them. This proved correct; Orphen was a magic-prodigy. Orphen eventually becomes the greatest sorcerer in the world. Orphen keeps his feelings and the story about Azalie to himself at first, but opens up later in the series. His true name is Krylancelo Finrandi (キリランシェロ・フィンランディ), and the people from the Tower of Fangs (Hartia, Azalie, Childman, Flameheart) still refer to him like that.",
