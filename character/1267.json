  "description" : "Rotom, known as the Plasma Pokémon, is a small, floating Pokémon whose body consists of plasma, which can infiltrate electronic devices. They are mischievous, and wreak havoc on electrical appliances just for the fun of it. Pokémon Platinum introduced five new forms of Rotom: Frost Rotom, Wash Rotom, Mow Rotom, Fan Rotom, and Heat Rotom. Each form`s appearance corresponds to a household appliance (a refrigerator, a washing machine, a lawn mower, a desk fan, and an oven, respectively). In the Pokémon universe, researchers are looking into Rotom as the power source of a unique motor.\nRotom are shaped like lightning rods, while the blue aura of electricity around them takes the appearance of lightning. Rotom`s eyes and aura of electricity change colors when it changes form. Rotom`s looks and abilities were inspired by Pulseman, a game that GameFreak worked on before Pokémon. Rotom is the word motor backwards; this may refer to the fact that motors make many appliances function, while Rotom makes them fail.\nThe only available Rotom in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl resides in a possessed television in an old haunted château. You can only catch him after 8:00 PM but before 4:00 AM. In North America, Toys R Us gave out Secret Keys, which unlocked Rotom`s forms, via Mystery Gift from April 20, 2009 to May 12, 2009. The alternate forms of Rotom may also be accessed in Silph Co. in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In the anime, Rotom made its debut appearance in Get Your Rotom Running! in all its different forms, toying around with Ash and friends. In Pokémon Adventures, Rotom appeared in the television at the Old Chateau.",
