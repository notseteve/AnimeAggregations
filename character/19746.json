  "description" : "Croissant Kamen is the code name for Ikki`s number one supporter. It was originally designed by Ringo as one of her alter egos. Her reasons were to protect her status as queen of \"new\" Sleeping Forest and to quietly be with Ikki. Croissant Mask first appeared during Kogarasumaru`s fight against Sabeltiger as an additional fighter. Over time, she has used the disguise to give advice and information to Ikki and others. At one point, she portrayed herself as Croissant Mask as an attempt to steal necessary items to create the original Storm Regalia. Ringo`s main outfit was a swimsuit, hat, cape, wig and big glasses.During the series of event, she has been forced to wear other outfits due to the outfit being stolen or destroyed.\nIn most recent chapters, Ringo used Croissant Mask to tell Ikki that she loved him and then passed the torch as the number one supporter to Kururu out of fear of the upcoming battle with Genesis.",
