  "description" : "Koharu`s Mandibuzz made first appearance when it was set out with Koharu`s other Pokémon so that Ash could see which Pokémon she had so he`d be interested in trading his Ash`s Scraggy with her.\nBattle against Ash`s Tepig\nKoharu`s Mandibuzz battled against Ash`s Tepig because Koharu`s Gothita liked Ash`s Scraggy but Ash was not willing to part with it. Koharu made a deal with Ash that if she won in a battle against him, he would be forced to trade his Zuruggu. Koharu`s Gothita chose Koharu`s Mandibuzz to battle against Ash, while Ash`s Tepig was sent out to battle against it.\nAsh`s Tepig proved to be the stronger Pokémon as it was able to endure Koharu`s Mandibuzz`s Brave Bird after it hit it directly the first time but on the second attempt Ash`s Tepig countered the Brave Bird attack with its Flame Charge and knocked it out to give Ash the victory so he didn`t have to trade his Zuruggu.",
