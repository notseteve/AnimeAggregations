  "description" : "Matsuura Yuu is the male protagonist of the series. Miki gives him the \"Marmalade Boy\" moniker as she thinks that he is like marmalade - pretty looking, and sweet only on the surface, yet bitter. Compared to Miki, Yuu`s character is almost a complete opposite to hers, as he tends to be more detached, less emotional, and less open about his feelings. He admits to admiring Miki`s ability to show her emotions clearly, and it being one of the reasons he fell in love with her. It is shown that Yuu is smart and naturally athletic, being able to excel in almost every sport although he did not join any clubs in order to focus on his studies. Yuu`s dream is to become an architect.\nSource: wiki",
