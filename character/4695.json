  "description" : "It`s the quiet ones you have to watch out for and intense Setsuna Sakurazaki is definitely a girl worth keeping an eye on. A childhood friend of class sweetie Konoka, Sakurazaki has been forcing distance between the former buddies and Konoka can`t figure out why. While on a class trip to Kyoto, Negi begins to suspect that not all is what it seems with Setsuna. It seems the girl is privy to some very secret knowledge. A kendo expert and apparent magic user as sharp and lethal as a polished blade, Setsuna lurks in the shadows for a reason! and when Konoka is attacked, Sakurazaki is obviously involved! Will she turn out to be a trusted ally or a dangerous foe?",
