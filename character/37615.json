  "description" : "The Bakeneko Clan is a clan of anthropomorphic cat youkai who were originally put in charge of Ukiyoe Town`s First District but were later usurped by the http://anidb.net/ch37613 [Kyuuso Clan]. They are a group that has existed for a long time and had built up evil deeds as gamblers before being taken under the http://anidb.net/ch37514 [Nura Clan]`s wing. Under their clan`s control, the First District thrived as a place for youkai entertainment - their speciality being gambling. Despite this, the clan seeks to govern their territory with dignity so as not to disgrace the Nura Clan. After regaining control of the First District, they open a Japanese-style youkai eatery called Bakenekoya.\nSource: Nurarihyon no Mago Wiki",
