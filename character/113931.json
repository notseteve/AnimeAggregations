  "description" : "The crown prince of the Renxandt Empire. In his previous life, he was Natsume Kengo, and he was regarded as the leader of the class. His skills are the real deal, but his habit of exaggerating his own abilities detracts from the magnitude of his power. He`s as belligerent as he was in his former life, viewing Shun as his rival.\nSource: Official page",
