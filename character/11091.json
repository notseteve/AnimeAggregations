  "description" : "Naraku is the series` primary antagonist. Naraku is responsible for most of the characters` misfortunes, including the death of http://anidb.net/ch10909 [Kikyou], the sealing of http://anidb.net/ch7245 [Inuyasha] to the sacred tree, http://anidb.net/ch12161 [Miroku]`s curse, and the death of http://anidb.net/ch12162 [Sango]`s family. Naraku was born from the fusion of http://anidb.net/ch72625 [Onigumo], a crippled human bandit tended by Kikyou, and a horde of weak demons. Driven by frustrated lust for Kikyou, Onigumo made a bargain with the demons: His soul would allow the demons to combine into one entity and he would become part of that new body. However the resulting half-demon promptly caused Kikyou`s death in an attempt to corrupt and possess the Shikon Jewel.\nNaraku is driven by three goals: To become a full demon, to possess a fully-corrupted Shikon Jewel, and to possess Kikyou. The third goal was a result of the fact that Onigumo`s heart remained a vital part of Naraku`s body, causing an obsession with Kikyou that prevents him from killing her. He attempts to rid himself of Onigumo`s heart multiple times, eventually succeeding in separating it into The Infant. With his heart freed from his obsession, he is able to later kill Kikyou. At the end of the manga, however, he expressed regret at not being able to have her for his own.\nThroughout the series, Naraku creates many subordinate beings from his own body to aid his goal of killing his opponents and reuniting the shards of the Shikon Jewel, whose corrupted form he hopes to use to gain ultimate power.",
