  "description" : "Kyral Mekirel is the Gundam fighter for Neo Nepal. A returning fighter from the eleventh tournament, Kyral was back then heavily predicted to win with his Tantora Gundam. In the finals of the 11th tournament, his only armament, left-handed claws, became stuck in the ground, rendering him unable to dodge a volley of blasts from his opponent, Gentle Chapman and his John Bull Gundam, who by defeating Kyral became a three-time Gundam Fight Champion. The attack caused an explosion in the cockpit, rendering Kyral blind. He later returned in the thirteenth tournament to avenge himself against all fighters with the Mandala Gundam.",
