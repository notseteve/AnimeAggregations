  "description" : "Calaveras is the second oldest of the sisters and has the ability, much like Tuxedo Mask, of communing with spirits of the dead. She is named for the mineral calaverite, and is a counterpart of Aino Minako.\nCalaveras is shown to be a petty woman who indulges in relentlessly teasing her other siblings, especially Petz. She also appears unwilling to do anything for herself. She never accepts a single mission and instead tags along on several of Petz`s missions.\nShe lacks any psychic power in the anime unlike in manga, and her attack is the Dark Beaut whip.\nSource: wiki",
