  "description" : "A doctor who runs the Hanazono clinic, and looks after most of the underworld denizens of Shinjuku. As a result, he does not make much money out of this venture and occasionally doubles as a club harker in order to make ends meet. Despite this, he is a very capable doctor. He is the second person after Umibozu to realize that Kaori has returned in Xiang Ying. In fact, before hiring Tomoko as his nurse, he had previously employed Kaori when she was around Xiang Ying`s age.\nIt should be noted that this \"Doc\" is based on the original Doc in the City Hunter manga where he helps Ryo out on a consistent basis. \"Doc\" did not appear in the City Hunter anime series, so therefore viewers may be confused as to how Ryo is associated with him.",
