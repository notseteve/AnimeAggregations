  "description" : "Zefiris is a Dragoon or powerful spiritual being, who has been watching the going-ons in this world for 5000 years, originally constructed to battle an alien race that attacked humans, but was used as a last resort plan to protect the Providence Breaker from the Peacemakers. Solemn, calm and quiet, Zefiris first appears as a mysterious character who seems to show up whenever the Casulls are in trouble, and often gives them hints that help them. Zefiris appears to have a very calm demeanour, and she first appears to be something like a cosmos guardian (Peacemaker), due to her strange abilities and unfazed demeanour, which is typical for the Peacemakers. She is one of the few remaining Dragoons since the Genesis War. She merges with Shannon, allowing him to become a D-Knight (D for Dragon or Dragoon) and to combat the Peacemakers. Shannon bares a significant resemblance to her true master that died in order to allow for Zefiris to live. While not quite a cold hearted as Natalie, Zefiris considered her mission to protect the Providence Breaker above all other things, including the lives of thousands of other humans. In the last episode Zefiris returns with the Casulls to their family farm to live out her days with her new master.",
