  "description" : "Team Skull Grunts are nasty bunch of people that will force people into battling them if you don`t watch your words and then try to take their opponents Pok√©mon as their prize for winning the battle. Tupp has multiple Salandit`s but it is virtually impossible to determine the difference.\nIts ability to quickly and easily climb steep cliffs was shown off when it quickly got to the Dark Crystal in SM25 but it wasn`t strong enough to get it out of the rock that it was embedded in.",
