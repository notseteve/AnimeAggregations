  "description" : "An evidently shrewd young woman who is seemingly wise beyond her (apparent) years, and who associates with very few friends. Surprisingly, even though she resembles a diminutive 15 year old or perhaps younger, her real age is 21; her physical development was stunted due to her \"standstills\", in the same way that they affect Kei. She had been in a \"standstill\" for 6 years. Ichigo`s loss of time and her sense of life cruelly having passed her by due to the illness (she wistfully reveals to Kei that she has a younger sister who is now married and expecting a child) tends to cause her to have a much more cynical and serious demeanour than is normal for someone of her seeming age, which is sometimes commented upon by her (much younger) friends.",
