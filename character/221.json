  "description" : "Psyduck is a duck-like Pok√©mon that can be found in some areas in Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh. Psyduck is known for its never-ending headache; in the anime, its strongest attacks can be used only when its headache reaches extremely painful levels. It is slow-witted and clumsy by nature, and the vacant expression often unnerves its foes. It evolves into Golduck at level 33. Is thought to be cute and very smart!\nIn the anime Misty has a Psyduck.",
