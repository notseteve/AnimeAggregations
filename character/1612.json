The peacock feather in his mask is actually still attached to the bird itself, which is skillfully hidden by Meister`s mastery of magic tricks. Additionally, when tasting bread, the feathers in Meister`s mask can change, depending on how good the bread is. He seems to have some fan girls, who follow him whenever they can.\nMeister had a very tough childhood, his mother was simply a young woman owning a bread store at the time when she met Yuuichi, apparently the two of them fell in love and had Meister; but when she got pregnant again with Sophie, he left to chase his dream to make a traditional style Japanese bread. After a while he came back with a few loaves of bread, just when Meister thought he came back for them Kirisaki greedily ate all the bread in front of his face, and Meister never forgave him.",
