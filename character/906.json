  "description" : "Poochyena is a dark-colored, dog-like hyena species of Pokémon common in the Hoenn region. It is an omnivore, able to eat almost anything, and it will attempt to take a bite out of anything that moves when it first sees it. This Pokémon is both aggressive and cowardly; it chases after prey until the victim becomes exhausted, but if the prey strikes back, Poochyena may turn tail and run away.",
