  "description" : "Domon`s Mienshao participated in the first round of the Donamite Tournament. Masaomi`s Nageki showed its incredible strength by using a three move combo: Superpower, Seismic Toss and the finishing move Circle Throw. Domon`s Mienshao was knocked out before it was even able to land a successful blow. While Domon`s Mienshao was fast, Masaomi`s Nageki was even faster at dodging the attacks. Domon`s Mienshao was defeated by Masaomi`s Nageki quite easily. With the win, Masaomi advanced to the second round while Domon was eliminated from the tournament.",
