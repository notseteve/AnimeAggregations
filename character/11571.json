  "description" : "Kuzaki Rinko is the tomboyish childhood friend of Yuuto (when he lived with his parents). Rinko cried with Yuuto when his parents died, and she helped him out of his depression. She has a crush on Yuuto and was quite comfortable in that position until the other girls started to flirt with him. Every year during a summer festival as a sort of tradition Yuuto buys Rinko two red ribbons that she wears all year round.\nShe has a cat named Ranmaru as a pet, which sometimes she uses as a tool to threaten Yuuto because of his allergies. She feels incredibly jealous towards most of the girls who flirt with Yuuto because of an inferiority complex from their well-endowed breasts. She always ruins every romantic/ecchi mood between Yuuto and other girls and always ends up hitting Yuuto in the head/face with her fist or what ever she can get her hands on to knock him down to the ground in most cases.",
