  "description" : "Sweet and gentle, Karen`s personality sometimes seems more suitable for an older (rather than younger) sister. She is a very skilled pianist. In the magazine stories and mini-novels, Karen owns a kitten named Vanilla (who, incidentally, has a thing for vanilla flavored sweets). Like several of the sisters, she refers to herself in the third-person and addresses her brother as Onii-chan (お兄ちゃん), a way to call a brother by a younger sibling, usually a child. Her birthday is September 23, is a Virgo and stands 148 cm (about 4` 10\") tall.",
