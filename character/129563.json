  "description" : "Zeraora is a mythical Pokemon that works with Dia. It helped him and Ash fight Guzzlord in the alternate universe where Alola was destroyed. Dia hasn`t captured Zeraora and he doesn`t really consider him his partner but they had a mutual desire to send Guzzlord back home and that was the thing that brought them together. Ash Ketchum could see that Dia and Zeraora got along well and suggested that the two of them made perfect partners.",
