  "description" : "A mass-produced mobile suit developed by Maius Military Industries as a successor to the GINN. Created using technology from the Earth Alliance`s captured Gundams, the GuAIZ is superior even to the high-performance CGUE. In addition to a beam rifle, it`s armed with two beam claws built into its shield, and a pair of extensional arrestors which can be used to grapple enemy mobile suits. Rau Le Creuset is one of the first ZAFT pilots to use the GuAIZ in combat. Aside from its colour scheme, his command version is identical to the regular model.",
