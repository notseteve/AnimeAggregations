  "description" : "Nami is a Sky Trainer and instructor at Kalos Canyon near Shala City. She was first seen battling an opponent which according to her was really weak, so she began looking for a new opponent and noticed that Ash Ketchum had been watching her.\nShe challenged Ash Ketchum to a sky battle and initially chose Ash`s Fletchling to battle her but her Fiarrow thought it was too weak to battle against and wanted to battle Ash`s Hawlucha instead. Ash Ketchum made a deal with her that if Ash`s Hawlucha defeated her Fiarrow, that Ash`s Fletchling could battle it also. Nami ended up winning that match and Ash`s Hawlucha was defeated. Not long after though, Nami`s Talonflame was captured by Rocket Gang and with the assistance of Ash`s Fletchling, it was set free.\nNami`s Talonflame wanted to battle Ash`s Fletchling after the events of Rocket Gang`s interference proved to it that Ash`s Fletchling was a strong opponent despite its initial impression. Nami`s Talonflame ended up being defeated after Ash`s Fletchling evolved into Ash`s Fletchinder during the battle.",
