  "description" : "Boogie is Anju`s favorite doll and constant companion. Loud and rude, he often speaks up loudly to support Anju`s interests. Boogie houses the soul of a serial killer (known as the Stripe Shirt Slasher) who killed 13 victims before his own death. The doll has a fabric knife in his hands, and when his soul escapes the doll, Boogie still attempts to kill people, though being a shadow can only scare them.",
