  "description" : "Sakamoto is a former member of the Joi. He is a good-natured man and optimistic to the point of being ridiculous, even in the most dangerous situations. His favorite phrase is \"AHAHA! It must be _____\". He also has a tendency to misspell names; he calls Gintoki \"Kintoki\". Gintoki often corrects him, citing that if he were named Kintoki, kin means gold (because `Kin` from `Kintoki` instead of `Gin` would make the title `Kintama`, which means `testicles` instead of `Gin Tama`, which means `silver soul`).\nDespite his goofy nature, Sakamoto is actually a successful businessman in the galaxy. He believes that business is a way of protecting his country. He has a private, well-equipped defensive business fleet. He believes that sacrifices should be made for the good of the community, which is why he chose to abandon his comrades on Earth to travel into space. Sakamoto is shown to be skilled with a pistol in an anime episode. His name is based on the historical character Sakamoto Ryoma.",
