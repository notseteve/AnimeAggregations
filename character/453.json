  "description" : "Porygon is the first man-made Pokemon, the product of extensive research by Silph Co. It consists entirely of programming code, allowing it to convert itself entirely back to program data. This allows it to move freely in cyberspace. This code is copy protected in order to prevent duplication. This code is fairly restrictive, limiting Porygon to certain pre-programmed motions, actions, and reactions. As it does not need to breathe, it is used in various environments, even some normally considered inhospitable.\nIn the Pokemon world, Porygon is only available as a prize from slot machines. As a result, a large number of people have taken to playing the slots seeking to win a Porygon. These gamblers are especially visible in the towns of Kanto and Johto. Porygon are not available in Hoenn at all. However, Porygon actually run wild in Sinnoh. Porygon is cheaper to obtain in some Pok√©mon versions than in others.\nPorygon`s most significant appearance in the Pokemon Anime to date is Dennou Senshi Porygon, an episode notorious for having caused hundreds of children to have epileptic seizures during its broadcast in Japan. Even though Pikachu caused the `seizure attack`, it was Porygon (and its evolved forms) who were banned from the Pokemon anime. Aside from that, Porygon has had only a few minor cameo appearances.",
