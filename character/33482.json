  "description" : "The Saint bearing the Leo Minor constellation in 1990 was Ban. He was sent along with 99 other orphans to different parts of the world to train to become a Saint. He earned his Cloth on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, and was thus one of the only ten that had succeeded in their training. When he returned to Japan to the Galaxian Wars fighting tournament, however, he met an early defeat at the hands of Unicorn Jabu. Feeling ashamed by his defeat, he returned to Tanzania to undergo further training, and returned when Athena had been incapacitated by the golden arrow. There, he protected the goddess from the soldiers of Sanctuary. He came to stay in Sanctuary and protected Seiya`s sister Seika from the assault of the god Thanatos.",
