  "description" : "Karl Fei-Ong was introduced to Diva in 1917 by Amshel. When he met her, he requested that she turn him into a chevalier. Karl`s body was heavily modified by Amshel`s experiments, including having the arm Saya destroyed in Vietnam in 1972 replaced with a spiked arm. His traumatic past, Diva`s inability to give him the love he sought, and forced conversion seems to have left Karl severely mentally unbalanced.",
