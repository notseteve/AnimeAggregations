  "description" : "Tachikoma is an AI walker/roller tank. They are best described as a \"spider type multi leg/multi ped combat vehicle equipped with artificial intelligence\", possessing the ability to act as both personnel transport units and mobile weapons platforms.\nTachikoma are as large as an average sedan, are painted blue and have four \"eyes\" fitted on the surface of their bodies. Three are on the \"head\" and one is beneath the abdomen. Each eye has three pinholes, loosely resembling a bowling ball. These eyes sometimes become expressive in the typical anime style. Tachikoma are controlled by individual AIs, are capable of speech and generally exhibit a childish, curious, joyful and active personality, although they are consummate professionals in the field. They normally operate as independent units and receive orders from human agents, but they can also be directly piloted from a cockpit in their abdomen.",
