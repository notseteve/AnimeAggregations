The Black Magic Club`s president, he tries to get people to join his club though is not too successful. However, anyone who joins gets a free \"Beelzenef\" doll. Umehito has one as a puppet, but it is also available as a voodoo doll. Nekozawa claims that if you write the name of the person you hate on the back of the doll, the person will be showered with misfortunes. Tamaki, especially, is superstitious about Nekozawa`s curses due to having experienced them first-hand, or so he believes.",
