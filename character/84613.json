  "description" : "Male Exorcist of the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order] that appeared in http://anidb.net/ch7366 [Kanda Yuu]`s flashbacks.\nHe`s actually Kanda`s previous incarnation, who was killed by an Akuma about thirty years before the start of the story. There was also a woman in his previous life whom he loved, a fellow Exorcist who died alongside him.\nAfter their deaths, the bodies of Kanda and his lover were taken to http://anidb.net/ch32500 [Asian Branch], where their brains were harvested and implanted into new bodies as part of the Second Exorcist Program. About twenty years later, http://anidb.net/ch84586 [Kanda] awoke in the Sixth Laboratory of the Asian Branch to his fellow Second Exorcist, http://anidb.net/ch84587 [Alma Karma], hovering over his birthing pit.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
