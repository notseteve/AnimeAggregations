  "description" : "Hiraga Gengai is Kabuki District`s greatest mechanic. He is a grey-bearded almost-bald person who wears goggles.\nHis son`s death left him with a deep emotional scar, and Takasugi took advantage of that and used him. He makes ugly and crude machines and has a bad habit of telling important parts-of-a-messages later, which usually gets Gintoki mutilated. Now he is seen making machines and fixing Gintoki`s bike.",
