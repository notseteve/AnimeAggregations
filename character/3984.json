  "description" : "A fellow Dragoon who knows Zefiris, and took part in the Genesis Wars but, unlike Zefiris, lost most of her powers. To survive, she inhabits an ancient battle-vehicle, the Skid, as part of her body. Due to Natalie`s integration with the Skid, she is able to both help or hinder the people on board. In order to continue to survive, Natalie has continued to upgrade her systems, but her abilities are limited and incomplete. Her personality is also cold and unfeeling, like the Peacemakers. Natalie does not consider herself a Dragoon anymore, even though, technically, she is still a Dragoon. Once, when Zefiris remarked that her methods were too forceful; the Dragoons were in the sealed world of Providence to be the Providence Breaker`s Guardians against the Peacemakers, and to help humans. Natalie replied - in a rather unconcerned manner - (I am no longer a Dragoon. But we Dragoons need not go out of our way to help those foolish humans). Hinting that the humans, were a class below them (the Peacemakers and the Dragoons). Later in the series, as Natalie is unable to fight as a Dragoon, she helps create Dragoon emulations, the Gigas who are like the Dragoons and Peacemakers, except they do not have a humanoid form. Natalie no longer considers herself a Dragoon due to her failure to protect her master.",
