  "description" : "One of the three commanders of the Underworld in Kurumada`s original manga, Heavenly Lofty Star, Griffon no Minos battled the Pisces Gold Saint of the same era. Minos is heartless, as he merely laughed when the Gold Saint Albafica informed him that his fellow Specters had fallen prey to the Gold Saint`s trap. Minos is also an outright sadistic, as he seems to have derived some pleasure from destroying an exceptional fighter, such as Albafica, whom he temporarily triumphed over, and thus at one point making Aries Shion involved. In the end, it took the Pisces Saint`s sacrificial effort to permanently destroy him, and also the Aries Saint`s intervention to prevent him from annihilating everything around in retaliation for his inevitable death.",
