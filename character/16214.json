  "description" : "Lord Alwin is the Baron of Nottingham that taxes his workers and keeps them working for him. He is the one that orders the destruction of the Huntington`s castle. He is based on the Sheriff of Nottingham in both character design and personality.\n\nNear the end of the series, due to Robin`s constant thwarting and a near death experience by him, he starts to make a change for the better until coming across a plot that would allow him to take over the kingdom, thus, changing him back to his greedy, inconsiderate self. Once again, however, his plan of action is stopped by Robin as well as King Richard.",
