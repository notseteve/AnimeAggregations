  "description" : "The boy chosen to pilot Zearth during the third battle with the robot, Cancer. He is a relatively quiet boy who likes to keep to himself. His father is a wary individual who runs a civilian contracting company. Kodama`s two gifted older brothers hate their father and try to go towards a different path, however Kodama looks up to him and his status as a \"chosen\" man. He even wears Kokopelli`s glasses to seem smarter like his father. Being raised by his father seems to have warped Kodama`s sense of ethics and morality to the point where he enjoys to take shots at stray cats with a pellet gun. During his time as a pilot he makes no attempt to avoid casualties and marvels at the death being caused because of him.\nThis sense of wonder is cut short when he is sent crashing down on top of his beloved father`s car, killing his father instantly. For a moment he is left completely stunned, but manages to shake himself out of it in time to kill Cancer using knowledge gained by having an understanding of construction. He dies unceremoniously a moment later. Kodama`s death alerts the other pilots to their fate. His chair is a plush office chair. There are 7,511 casualties during his battle, many due to his own malice.",
