  "description" : "Satozuka Kenta is a third-year university student taking up Business Administration. He is both the leader and one of the guitarists of the band GYROAXIA, as well as being the older brother of Wataru Matoba.\nBewitched by Nayuta Asahi`s talent, he spares no effort in making his name well-known. Though he seems to be one of the more approachable members of GYROAXIA, he has a cold attitude towards his bandmates, and even Nayuta, whom he only appreciates as a vocalist, rather than as a person. He is proficient in intel-gathering and uses it to gather information on rival bands, among others. Additionally, despite Wataru`s bitterness towards him, he unconditionally loves and is protective of his little brother, even offering him some advice and a listening ear when he`s in need of it.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream!
