  "description" : "An officer of the 21st Airborne Unit of the Orb Union`s ground forces. Kisaka was born in the town of Tassil in northern Africa, and when Cagalli travels to northern Africa to fight alongside the Desert Dawn resistance group, Kisaka accompanies her as a bodyguard. Well aware that it`s pointless trying to keep Cagalli out of trouble, he calmly tags along wherever she goes, in the process making sure that she doesn`t inadvertently reveal her true identity.",
