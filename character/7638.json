  "description" : "Meroko is a rabbit shinigami with long ears, capable of transforming into an anthropomorphic bunny stuffed toy. In the anime, she is fond of changing her appearance into other characters using the catchphrase \"Mero Mero Change!\" Meroko is Takuto`s partner and is infatuated with him, though her love is unrequited. She is jealous of Takuto`s affection for Mitsuki, and fears that being around Mitsuki will cause Takuto to remember his past, and thus become a ghost. Meroko was Izumi`s former partner and was infatuated with him; when Izumi grew tired of her frequent declarations of love, he tricked her into training newcomer Takuto in his place.",
