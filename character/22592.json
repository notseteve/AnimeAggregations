Ivysaur quickly charged at Pikachu who just managed to avoid the attack, however, Ivysaur used Vine Whip which swept Pikachu off of its feet. Ivysaur charged again at Pikachu who tried to halt its progress with a Thundershock but Ivysaur either dodged the attack or defended itself with its vines. Ivysaur then launched itself in the air and launched a Solarbeam attack followed by a tackle attack which Pikachu could not recover from and eliminated Ritchie from the competition and putting Assumpta into the Semi-Finals.\n(On the podium at the end Assumpta`s sillouette matches the girl on 2nd place very well)",
