  "description" : "Ran, is a girl who lives in Gabe and sells flowers in Lukuss and has psychic abilities. She is a \"Seer\", a person who can see the possible near future. Because this ability causes her to see things that she does not want to, Ran tends to shut herself off from the world within her mind. Will the future of Ichise and Lukuss in her eyes somehow become a key to this story?\nIn Gabe, Ran is considered to be sacred (her current position is apprentice-priestess) and therefore she is protected. Any harm done to Ran is harm done to Gabe, and for this reason, she can move around Gabe and Lukuss in a relatively free manner.",
