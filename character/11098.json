  "description" : "With the development of the MS-14 Gelgoog far behind schedule, the Zeon military decided to adapt the land warfare mobile suit Dom for space combat. The result is the Rick Dom, in which the jet engines that give the Dom its hovering capabilities are replaced by rockets. Otherwise, it`s basically the same as the land version - a fast, heavily-armoured mobile suit armed with a devastating bazooka. By the end of the war, the Rick Dom has all but replaced the Zaku II in the ranks of Zeon`s space forces.",
