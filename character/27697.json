On the surface, she is proud of her heritage and lifestyle, but is unable to bear being discriminated for it. She has the ability to read the minds of others, becoming fascinated with Edward`s world after witnessing his memories of it. Believing she wouldn`t be discriminated in Edward`s world, Noah assists the Thule Society in opening the Gate based on information from Edward`s memories, but relents once Edward points out that his home is no utopia, and leaves Munich together with the Elric brothers.",
