  "description" : "Yazoo is one of the three Remnants of Sephiroth, along with Loz and Kadaj, who are the antagonists of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. He embodies Sephiroth`s allure, and has a cool demeanour.\nHe is, like his brothers, very strong and agile, although not as much as Loz. In battle Yazoo typically uses his agility to keep his distance and shoot his opponents up with his Velvet Nightmare - he is a skilled marksman with the weapon and is able to shoot off Cloud`s goggles at point-blank range while only scratching Cloud`s face. He usually battles alongside Loz, whose melee attacks and brute strength compliment Yazoo`s agility and long-range tactics perfectly.",
