  "description" : "Viola`s Surskit was matched up against Pikachu in Ash`s first gym match against Viola. Clemont thought that against a Bug/Water type like Ametama, Electric types have the advantage by far. Viola`s Surskit though used Ice Beam on the field and it was able skate around fast. Pikachu had a hard time keeping its balance and was then knocked out by Viola`s Surskit`s Signal Beam.\nIn the rematch battle, the field was iced again but this time Pikachu stabilized itself by stabbing its tail into the ground. A quick Thunderbolt hit Viola`s Surskit and knocked it out.",
