  "description" : "Suwonkas is the emperor of Na Tunk. He is somewhat insane and extremely sadistic, with an entire garden of flowers grown on the bodies of live humans. He was apparently infatuated with Karura, who apparently castrated him in the past, an action that, oddly enough, he expresses gratitude for. He is killed by Derihourai during the Karurawaturei`s rebellion.",
