  "description" : "The home-room teacher of Class 2-2. Known as King Moron in English and Morokin in Japanese, he is snobbish and judgemental to current teenage pop culture and constantly reminds his students to study hard, addressing them with disdain almost to the point of verbal abuse. He is insensitive to the problems of others, as seen when talking to Kanji during summer camp. He constantly threatens to expel students that misbehave.\nSource: Wikipedia",
