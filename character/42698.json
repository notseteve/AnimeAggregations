  "description" : "Zeno is Killua`s grandfather and Silva`s father. A witty old man, his advancing age has not dampened his quick thinking and speed in battle. He appears to be on good terms with Chairman Netero, who hires Zeno for the initial assault on the palace in East Gorteau in order to catch the Chimera Ants off guard. Zeno favors Killua more than his other grandchildren.\nSource: Wikipedia",
