  "description" : "Kurumada introduced Aiolos in chapter 24 of his manga, contained in vol. 6.\nHe is one of the 12 Guardians of Sanctuary, with the Sagittarius as his destined constellation. Aiolos is the famous gold saint who died protecting Athena when she was an infant.\nAiolos always was a paradigm of righteousness, seen as the perfect Saint and one of the two Gold Saints who could succeed Aries Shion as the next Pope of Sanctuary and the chosen one.\nNot much is known about Aiolos, since he died before the main story began. More of him is seen in Saint Seiya Episode G, like his relationship with Garan, a servant of his young brother, Leo Aiolia, who once trained with Aiolos for the Sagittarius cloth.\nDespite his condition, Aiolos managed to help the main characters many times sending his cloth to aid them.\nAiolos is probably named after the Greek god of Wind, Aeolus.",
