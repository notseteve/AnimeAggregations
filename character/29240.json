  "description" : "Cancer no Manigoldo is the Gold Saint of Cancer and disciple of the previous Cancer Gold Saint, Sage. He was shown as being somewhat hostile and talking in an informal, almost humorous way. Manigoldo is bold, aggressive, arrogant and very confident, he believed that the dead of all eras are nothing but waste. When meeting Sage, he decides to train in the Sanctuary to understand the idea that \"every person who is alive or dead is part of the universe.\"\nManigoldo was taught by Sage a large number of techniques related with souls. In direct relation to the oriental folklore pertaining the Cancer constellation, he has the ability to send souls to the entrance to the Underworld with his Praesepe Underworld Waves, with Praesepe Demonic Blue Flames Manigoldo creates an orb in his hand, igniting every soul nearby, thus incinerating the souls of his opponents and with Praesepe Soul Burial Waves Manigoldo uses stray souls nearby as gunpowder to create a great explosion. Apart from the attacks involving souls, Manigoldo can use a physical attack called Acubens in which Manigoldo uses both his legs as pincers of a crab`s claw to cut his opponent in half, hence the name.\nDuring the series Manigoldo encounters Thanatos, a feat which proves too much and has him almost killed. With the aid of his master Sage, however, he proves to be a challenge for the god. In his last moments, Manigoldo launches a last-ditch attack against Thanatos` physical body, destroying it and in the aftermath being pulverized himself, giving Sage a chance to seal Thanatos away. After the death of Sage, the soul of Manigoldo appears in the Sanctuary and gives to Aries Shion the helmet of the Pope to give it to his teacher.",
