  "description" : "Bea is the Gym Leader at the Stow-on-Side Stadium in the Galar region. The gym specializes in Fighting-type Pokémon and she`s an expert with them. As the inheritor of Galar karate`s hundred-year history, she knows how to fight. She is traveling the world, visiting every dojo and challenging them and building up both her Pokémon and herself, seeking to reach perfection.\nBea battled against Korrina awhile back and Bea won the battle because she believed Korrina was overconfident. She then battled and defeated the Karate Master at the Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.\nAt the beginning of the Pokémon World Coronation Series Great Class battle against Ash Ketchum, her rank was 751 which was higher than his 890 rank. She got into Ash Ketchum`s head from the start of the battle though as she told him about her defeating Korrina which made him mad. She controlled the match and defeated Ash Ketchum giving him his first Pokémon World Coronation Series loss and lowered his ranking to 930. Her Hawlucha and Grapploct didn`t take much damage during the match.",
