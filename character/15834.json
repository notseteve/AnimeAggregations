  "description" : "The third person fought by Shichika. Meisai wields Tsurugi, a thousand exact copies of one sword of Shikizaki`s doing. Meisai claims her real name was long forgotten. Her current name was taken from a priest she had killed. She was the daughter of a powerful kendo master, but died along with all his followers. She later became a bandit leader, inheriting Tsurugi through them. Her killing spree came to an end after meeting and killing the original Meisai Tsuruga. She is now the head of Sanzu shrine taking care of a group of mikos that have been abused by men to the point of killing almost any man. The thousand Tsurugi blades are used by her mikos and two bodyguards. She hopes that their supposed magical properties could cure the abused girls of their dangerous nature, which is worked to a small degree. Despite her willingness to surrender Tsurugi to Togame she is willing to fight for them for the sake of the girls. Her fighting style is called Sentouryuu, which revolves around using as many blades to her disposal, which Tsurugi provides.\nShe is killed by Shichika in one last stand after he tells her that she possesses the real Tsurugi out of the thousand and that it was fate that brought them together. Before dying she asks a favour of Togame in the case of her death she would want protection over the shrine and the girls from the shogunate, which Togame agrees to.",
