  "description" : "While traveling through the Yaguruma Forest towards Castelia City, Ash encountered a Sewaddle that attacked Pikachu with String Shot. It later attacked Ash as well but just as Ash tried to capture it with his Poké ball, it escaped. Ash decided that he still wanted to capture it as it showed a feisty fighting spirit which Ash liked. He decided to follow it into the forest.\nAfter finding Sewaddle in the forest again, Ash showed Sewaddle that he was a good trainer by rescuing it from a surprise Woobat attack. Ash tried to rescued it again after a Patrat attempted to capture it but just before Ash showed up, Sewaddle managed to get its String Shot stuck to a passing Shikijika. It fell off a cliff into a raging river towards a waterfall but Ash went in after it. They were both rescued by Arti`s Hahakomori and Arti`s Hahakomori made a new leaf backing for Sewaddle.\nSewaddle gained Ash`s trust and was then allowed itself to be caught in a Poké ball but as Ash tried to recall it after being captured, the Poké ball wouldn`t work as Sewaddle was his 7th on hand Pokémon. Ash decided to keep his Sewaddle on his team at that time for training.",
