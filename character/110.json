  "description" : "The first Strike Witch and sub-commander of the unit, with the commissioned rank of Squadron Leader and official rank of Major. Mio is also the oldest witch at nineteen (later, twenty) years old and, like Yoshika, comes from Fuso. She is seemingly the toughest and most mature of the Witches, being an experienced veteran of the early fighting against the Neuroi. She knew Yoshika`s father while he was first designing the Striker Unit and was the first person to pilot one. Her usual task is to train new recruits, and in this role she becomes a very strict disciplinarian, appropriately gaining the ears and tail of a Doberman when equipped with her Striker. Otherwise she is quite friendly, if a little too forward at times, with a very distinct laugh. Under Mio`s eyepatch is a magic eye that grants her increased visual prowess and the ability to spot Neuroi cores when used.",
