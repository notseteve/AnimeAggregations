  "description" : "The spoiled daughter of an Earth Federation official, Quess is fascinated with the notion of Newtypes, and hopes to continue her studies with the help of ace pilot Amuro Ray. When she is rebuffed by Amuro`s girlfriend Chan Agi, Quess turns instead to Char, and volunteers to fight for him as a Neo Zeon soldier (under the alias \"Quess Air\"). However, while Quess proves to be a powerful natural Newtype, she lacks the emotional maturity to handle the sensations of real battle, and the aggression and terror of the battlefield soon begin to overwhelm her vulnerable mind.\nSource: Official Site",
