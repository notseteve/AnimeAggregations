They discover a Pokémon that resembles Ho-oh as soon as they arrive! The two are overjoyed, but it turns out that Ho-oh is just a fake; and it was Kurio who had disguised his own Pokémon. Kurio told them that he wants to show Ho-oh to his grandpa no matter what. He climbed up the tower but in the end, only his grandpa managed to see the real Ho-oh fly by.",
