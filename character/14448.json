  "description" : "Kaoru is the third and final member of the Powerpuff Girls Z team. She transforms using the phrase \"Powered Buttercup\" and uses a Daruma Otoshi hammer. She hates skirts and other girly things, which is the reason why she was reluctant to join the group. In fact, she even hates girls who are too feminine. Like the original Buttercup, Kaoru is a tomboy and is the most easily enraged of the three. Famous for being the most athletic girl in school, Buttercup enjoys all kinds of sports and spends a great deal of time watching sports on television. She is especially good at soccer. She speaks with a hard and masculine edge and rarely uses honorifics when speaking, though she will speak a little more like a girl in later episodes. Her greatest fear is ghosts. Kaoru also has a slight crush on Butch Z after holding her kiss until told she could stop. Kaoru lives with her father, who is a professional masked-wrestler, mother and two brothers, one older and one younger. She is represented by stars. She dreams of being a professional wrestler like her dad in the future. Her jacket is yellow-green.",
