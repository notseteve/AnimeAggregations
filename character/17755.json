  "description" : "Misty Cornwell is a new female character rescued by the crew at the beginning of the Second Stage. Found inside a human-sized pod who was rescued after a short scuffle between the Nirvana and several Harvester units, Misty is from the planet Pluto, in the same solar system the planet Earth is located. As such, she is well-knowledged in the old-fashioned ideals about men and women, such as the typical boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, which confuses the others and makes Dita feel jealous. Like Dita, Misty is an excellent cook and uses her knowledge of men along with that to her advantage. Though she later gives up on trying to win Hibiki`s heart, she does allow Dita to realize her own affections for Hibiki. Meanwhile she turns her attentions towards Meia. She is sometimes seen with a blob-like creature named Q-chan hovering on her left shoulder.\nMisty does not appear in the manga.\nSource: wiki",
