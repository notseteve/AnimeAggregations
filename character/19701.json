  "description" : "Udou Akira is the leader of the AT team Behemoth, developing it after leaving the Wind swat team and winning the Fang Regalia in a battle against Agito. He is highly skilled in the Bloody Road and was able to evolve the Fang attack into the more deadly Gigaer Cross, which overpowered Agito`s Leviathan Fang (although Agito was performing the attack with normal ATs). He is defeated by Agito and Ikki, returns the Fang Regalia, and rejoins Wind. He is injured by the Takeuchi brothers afterward. His immense strength is the result of a genetic condition he was born with that means his muscles are up to nine times more dense than a normal humans. He shares this condition with Bandou Mitsuru.",
