  "description" : "Minato is a tall, blond girl with a tanned complexion reminiscent of the Ganguro style, and also has a more developed bust than the other girls. Despite her mature appearance, she has a very child-like personality which causes her to become teary eyed over the most trivial of matters. She also maintains an unusual level of childish innocence, causing her to interpret things differently than the other and at times be almost helpless doing the simplest of tasks. When she receives help from other students, she will persistently and excessively try to return the favour back to the person usually well beyond the norm and almost completely attaching to them. She is often seen in the company of Makunouchi Ushio, often hanging on her or giving her trouble with her childish personality.",
