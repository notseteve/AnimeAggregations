  "description" : "A member of an American family of En-Jutsushi, specially skilled in creating and controlling spirit beasts to harness flames. She manipulates myriads of spirits into a single virtual persona to grasp tremendous power. While seemingly capable of creating different spirit beasts, her favorite is Metatron, an angel-like statue equipped with a sword. Kazuma has observed and mentioned that her fighting style is similar to Ayano`s, referring to their simplistic and direct attacks, which lack any strategy or tactics. A rival against Ayano in both En-Jutsushi and Kazuma`s \"love\".",
