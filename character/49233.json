  "description" : "In the years following Space War I, the United Nations Government (UNG) quickly rebuilt much of the lost infrastructure and soon the UN Spacy was rebuilding the fleet. Impressed with the initial combat performance and multi-functionality of the http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class Space Carriers, the UN Spacy pursued design and construction of a next generation http://anidb.net/ch48791 [ARMD] Class vessel. The result is the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier, an improved space carrier with stealth capabilities and its own Space Fold System for interstellar travel. As a carrier, the Guantánamo Class has a large launch bay in the forward section, a dock in the aft section of the ship (to link with large vessels) and large external fuel tanks with stealth covers. Though this class of vessel utilized many new technologies, the economy of design proved relatively inexpensive and the UN Spacy deployed massive numbers of Guantánamo Stealth Carriers. These ships are found primarily as the main-force carrier in the colonization fleets, but the Guantánamo Class Stealth Carrier is also used extensively for planetary defense. In 2040, Earth has a vast defense fleet stationed in orbit consisting of numerous vessels that included the Guantánamo Class ships as well as thousands of armed defense satellites spread amongst the fleet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossplus/guantanamo-stealthcarrier.htm",
