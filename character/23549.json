  "description" : "The strongest delinquent of Hekikuu high, previously suspended for beating up one of the teachers: after being defeated by Kitano, he proclaims himself his \"little brother\". He sports spiked bleached hair and has no eyebrows.\nAfter claiming loyalty to Kitano, he becomes less delinquent-like. He doesn`t get into a lot of fight anymore (although he doesn`t lose any of his fighting skill), nor does he skip classes, staying calm most of the time. His old, hot-blooded self, comes to the surface when someone tries to harm Kitano or himself.\nAt the end of the series, when confronted with the fact of Kitano being `normal` - Takehisa`s old comrades had come and asked him to join up in order to beat up Kitano - he proclaimed that whether or not Kitano is a delinquent, he is still Takehisa`s best friend. He then proceeded to beat up his old comrades with a smile on his face.\nSource: Wikipedia",
