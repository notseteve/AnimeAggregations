  "description" : "Louis XV, king of France and Navarre is depicted as a charming man with a relaxed manner and does not seem stressed even in the direst of circumstances. He orders d`Eon and his companions to uncover the truth behind the death of his favoured diplomat Lia. He is very loosely based on the historical Louis XV of France (1710-1774).",
