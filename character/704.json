  "description" : "Kotori is the student of Kazemi affiliated junior high class 3-3 and the school`s idol. Through the power of the magical sakura tree, she can hear other people`s thoughts, but she carefully hides this ability. She became close to Jun`ichi because he was the only one in the male student body that did not try to idolize her. In the anime`s first season, she is Sakura`s classmate. She is also the younger sister of Koyomi Shirakawa, Jun`ichi`s homeroom teacher. In the game it was mentioned that she was adopted into the Shirakawa family, and is the cousin of Sayaka Shirakawa from Suika.",
