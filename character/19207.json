However, her clumsiness stands out. Unaware of the plot from the chief secretary Matsudaira Takamori, she challenges Muneakira who was branded as a villain.\nShe can swing a large hammer bigger than her own height to fight and is a user of the \"Naoe-style hammer fighting techniques\", that despite how it looks, it`s an extremely bold fighting style.\nShe`s a childhood friend of Yukimura and they seem to have a very close connection.",
