  "description" : "Ryuuji is a sixteen-year-old high school student in his second year, class C. Due to biological inheritance, his eyes make him look like an intimidating delinquent and causes many misunderstandings in his life. He lives in a fatherless family with just his mother, and due to this, Ryuuji has learned to be self-sufficient. He is good at cooking and keeping everything in his house clean (nearly to the point of obsession), and also excels at sewing. He holds a crush on Kushieda Minori, a girl his age in his class as he appears to have a weakness for the airhead type. He has a pet parakeet named \"Inko-chan\" (inko literally means parakeet in Japanese). Ryuuji often helps Taiga with domestic chores which she is otherwise unable to perform. At school, he is known as \"the only person able to stop the palmtop tiger\", referring to Taiga`s nickname. Ryuuji and Taiga become rumoured as a couple since they spend so much time together, though this rumour stopped when Taiga viciously destroyed her classroom trying to make everyone see that it was a misunderstanding. As the story continues, he starts to develop feelings for Taiga.",
