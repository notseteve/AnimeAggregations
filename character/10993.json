  "description" : "Band member in the music group \"Fire Bomber\". He challenged the Protodeviln not with military might, but with power of song. His songs had the power to revive energy in a living body. His abnormally strong life energy, called Anima Spiritia was monitored by the Protodeviln army. Basara continued to sing, regardless of friend or foe, often irritating those around him because they didn`t understand him. As reports of his heroism spread, he resented the comparison of his songs as weapons.",
