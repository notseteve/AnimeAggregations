  "description" : "Maria is the young princess from the country of Havonia currently attending Holy Land Academy along with Lashara. She and Lashara are cousins, but they are not fond of each other and attempt to engage in constant one-upmanship. She is very close to her servant Yukine, and is rarely seen without her. Maria is the daughter of Flora, and along with Lashara is frequently embarrassed by her mother`s antics. She supports Yukine into having Kenshi fall for her, and has recently shown that she too has feelings for him. Her mother has also shown love for Kenshi, even to go as far as making Maria, Aura and Kenshi engaged.\nHer family name is a reference to Sir Papacharino Nanadan from Kajishima`s earlier work Photon.\n[i]Source: Wiki[i]",
