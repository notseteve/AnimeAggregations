  "description" : "As commander of the Zero Zero Organization, he is boss of the 9 Number Group. His personal history is wrapped completely in mystery, and no one knows his true identity. His relationship with Mylene can be seen as one of a father figure, but during a mission, their exchanges are always businesslike. On occasion, he has shown emotion when speaking frankly with his subordinates, but he is essentially calm, cool, and collected, allowing him to give his subordinates appropriate orders. He is the brains of the Zero Zero Organization.",
