  "description" : "James` Inkay was first spotted in Miare City when it ate James` croissant. It seemed to like the food that he was eating and it followed them on their journey. When they stopped to eat lunch, it appeared again and this time it ate his sandwich. In a quick battle with Wobbuffet, Inkay squirted ink all over its face. James then lured it with more sandwiches and then caught it with a monster ball.\nJames` Inkay often uses an ink squirting attack during battles but its not an actual move.",
