  "description" : "IMPORTANT NOTE: Winner is an anime-only character and does NOT appear in the manga-verison.\nA vampire hunter descended from a long line of hunters, Winner is very melodramatic, and his hunting garb is flamboyant: a black, flowing Neo-style long overcoat, with a white chest and a gold \"W\" plastered across the front, and a huge wide-brimmed hat with a feather sticking out of it. His blond good looks make him extremely popular with the girls at the school and his \"cool\" appearance is also commented on by passing strangers.\nHe transfers to Karin`s high school and falls in love with her at first sight, constantly making romantic overtures toward her. Despite being a vampire hunter, he does not know about Karin`s true nature, as he is blinded by love and possibly also because he is not very bright.\nAs a child, he met a girl with whom he shared his first kiss. However, the girl he \"kissed\" was (unknown to him at the time) actually a younger Karin, who bit him and injected her blood into him.\nThere is one massive stumbling block to Winner`s progress as a vampire hunter, however: he has hemophobia (aka, a fear of blood), which goes as far as feeling sick when seeing spilt red paint.\n(From Wikipedia)",
