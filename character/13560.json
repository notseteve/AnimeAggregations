  "description" : "Taneshima Popura is a waitress at Wagnaria, and the first employee of the odd restaurant that Takanashi meets. While she is a year older than Takanashi (who calls her `senpai`, as she is his upperclassman at the same school), she is very small for her age, and is too weak to perform some of the menial tasks at the restaurant. She does not take kindly to remarks about her small size, even when they are meant to be complimentary.",
