  "description" : "Kazekiri is a Level 2 Akuma who attempted to help http://anidb.net/ch32757 [Road Kamelot] locate http://anidb.net/ch7368 [Miranda Lotto]`s Innocence.\nKazekiri has a pendulum-like body with a handle-shaped upper torso. His `arms` are protruding blades that he can bend at will and spin rapidly in order to stay airborne. Like his fellows, http://anidb.net/ch32757 [Ice] and http://anidb.net/ch86421 [Pang], Kazekiri is shown to be bloodthirsty but simpleminded, seen playing a game of \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" in the middle of a fight to decide how to kill http://anidb.net/ch7347 [Allen Walker].\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki",
