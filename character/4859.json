  "description" : "An enigmatic maid sent by Ayumi`s father into the service of the Yoshikawa household, apparently to collect data. An effective maid, she is taciturn and quite able to cause trouble and thwart Ayumi`s attempts to seduce Haruo. Her seeming obliviousness to the present conceals a calculating cunning that rivals even Fuyuno`s.\nIt is later revealed that she is an artificially-created human. The sound of a cymbal solo - A short musical quotation from The Terminator - follows her as she goes into action.",
