  "description" : "A hard-working and responsible boy despite his gruff \"no-nonsense\" exterior. He dedicatedly took care of his three younger siblings: Yoshi, Futaba, and Santa. He accepted this task because their mother had died much earlier, and their father abandoned them for unknown reasons three years ago. Their uncle on their father`s side made up for his brothers disappearance by renting a home for the four siblings to live in, and paying for all expenses. Daiichi earned his keep by working as a mail and newspaper boy, and for his uncles landscaping business on his days off. He chose to live separately from his uncle with his siblings so that his father would have a place to return to if he ever decided to. When he and the other main characters first got involved with Zearth, he was the first to express any doubts and the first to try to leave the \"game\" before the group learned the truth of their involvement. His chair was not actually a chair, but a mere floating cushion, and he was lightly teased by a few of the other kids for this lack of imagination.",
