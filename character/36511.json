  "description" : "The Coffee Monkeys are a kidnapping group based on the Sabaody Archipelago. True to their group name, they have monkey tails and appearances, as well as act like the said animals. When the Straw Hat Pirates visit them they are drunk because their prize slave catch, a giant, was for nothing because Peterman took a mermaid to the Auction House after them. The only reason that they caught the giant was due to him being asleep at the time.",
