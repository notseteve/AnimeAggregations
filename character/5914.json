  "description" : "Yuuichi is a member of the Fuuka Academy Student Council. He first appears in Episode One on the same ferry that Tokiha Mai is taking and the two quickly form bad impressions of each other. Munakata Shiho calls him her older brother even though they are not related by blood. He works with the Student Council doing odd jobs for them (prompting Mai to label him a \"lackey\") and sits next to Mai in class.\nYuuichi used to be a member of the Fuuka kendo club and regularly made it into the nationals until he was suffered a severe injury to his knee at some point in the past, though the exact circumstances and nature of the injury are never explained in the anime.",
