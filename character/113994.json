  "description" : "One of http://anidb.net/ch81326 [Ami]`s best friends. Mischievous and carefree, she and http://anidb.net/ch113923 [Kyouko] are very close to Ami. Unlike Ami, both Satomi and Kyouko are very promiscuous and they take Ami to a disco to try to get Ami laid without knowing the circumstances behind her sadness. Satomi pushes Ami to drink alcohol and due her and Kyouko`s carelessness, Ami becomes a victim of http://anidb.net/ch81323 [Kouno], a philanderer that both Satomi and Kyouko are careful of. Not knowing that their actions led Ami to be in a worse emotional state, when they know the truth behind Ami and http://anidb.net/ch113512 [Hiroshi]`s relationship, Satomi and Kyouko try to cheer Ami up. Satomi is the one that points out that Ami and her stepbrother are not related by blood, so it`s okay to pursue a romantic relationship, and she also encourages Ami to be herself when the latter doesn`t know what she wants to do with her life.",
