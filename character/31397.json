  "description" : "Tsukishima Sorajirou is Misora`s grandfather and the head of the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF). His daughter (Misora`s mother) is constantly away from home, so Misora lives with Sorajirou. He is always depicted as carrying what appears to be a plush-doll version of Captain Juzo Okita from Space Battleship Yamato. Rikushirou and Sorajirou have been rivals since their college days. Sorajirou enlisted his granddaughter in the Air Defence Forces just to keep up with Rikushirou.",
