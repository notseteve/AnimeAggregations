  "description" : "Toomine Kasumi is a 6th grade role model student of the peach class of the 9th elementary school and member of the http://anidb.net/ch27105 [Anti-Alien Squad]. She`s a natural talent for the Anti-Alien Squad tasks and in perfect harmony with her pink http://anidb.net/ch27089 [Bougu].\nKasumi is the daughter of a wealthy family; she excels in many activities (including ballet, playing the piano, and various sports), many of which she does with \"I like it\" as her only reason. Her favourite fragrance is \"Burberry Weekend\". She has an older brother who studies abroad and apparently yearns for his return.\nBehind her glittering appearance she hides her loneliness; the events of episode 4 strongly imply an incestuous relation with her brother.",
