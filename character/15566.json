  "description" : "An immature, cute little Muglox (with a height of 8 cm) who is Mirumo`s younger brother and Kaoru`s partner. Murumo loves marshmallows as much as Mirumo loves chocolate, and he uses his personality to relax or manipulate others to get what he wants. At times, he is kind and sweet to his friends and is willing to help them when they are in trouble. But he can also be greedy and selfish when it comes to marshmallows, and will do anything to make Kaoru give him some (even telling him about Kaede and Setsu`s dates). He commonly uses the phrases \"deshu\" or \"mashu\". When he is angry, he uses the two \"antenna\" on his hat to create lightning and electrocute the offender. He uses a snare drum as his magic tool.",
