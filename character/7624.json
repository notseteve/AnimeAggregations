  "description" : "Eclipse is the Chief of Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs (GOTT) which job is to ensure normal economic activity on all of the planets in the Galaxy operating to an extent under the guise of the Galactic Union. Mainly she ensures this by sending of various groups of people to either fight, arrest, seize, destroy or assist in order to achieve the goal of normal economic activity.\nIn each of these instances she sends out an ES team. She never gets directly involved. Though in order for the members to make an arrest they must seek permission through her.\nEclipse`s personality is one of collected calm and eloquence, for this she is greatly admired by Eclair. She never says a word wrong and smoothly operates the GOTT. Even in anger she is reasonable, but when she is expected to carry out actions she doesn`t often do them willingly, an indication that she never speaks her mind.",
