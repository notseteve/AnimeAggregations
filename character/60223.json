  "description" : "A two-tailed panther spirit belonging to Hinozuka Nachi.\nHe originally chose Nachi`s older brother Yuri, who sadly didn`t have the sight to see the Sacred Beasts, so he didn`t think it was real. When he had to leave the Hinozuka mansion and went into the manor, he was suddenly able to see Kaede, yet couldn`t bare it - he denied the existence of Kaede. As Nachi was given the sight, Kaede chose him instead of Yuri later. Since then, Yuri has already passed away.",
