  "description" : "The Zaoldyeck family is considered by and far the most deadly assassins in the Hunter Ã— Hunter world. The family owns and lives at Kukuroo mountain, a dormant volcano in the Dentora region of the Republic of Padokia which stands 3772 meters. Their estate is surrounded by huge stone walls guarded by a giant dog named Mike and highly skilled attendants. Few people unrelated to the family have any idea what is within the estate. There is lots of mystery surrounding the Zaoldyeck family; a single photo of any of the members can be sold for millions.\nSouce: hunterxhunter.wikia.com",
