  "description" : "Ash`s Gengar was caught at the Sakuragi Institute in the Kanto region. Gengar`s Trainer was its previous Trainer three years prior to Ash Ketchum catching it. Gengar`s Trainer ran into Ash Ketchum while Ash`s Gengar was attached to Ash Ketchum`s shadow. He got rid of Gengar because he was very unlucky. He couldn`t win a battle, and every Pokémon he tried to catch would get away. He also would fall down the steps and he`d lose things all the time. He blamed all these mishaps on Gengar`s curse. He left Gengar at the building that years later would become the Cerise Laboratory. Since then, he thinks his luck had changed without Gengar.\n[h1]Pokémon World Championships Battle VS Visquez[/h1]\nThis was the first battle for Gengar as one of Ash Ketchum`s caught Pokémon. The combination of Pikachu and Ash`s Gengar during the Pokémon World Championships match was too much for Visquez`s Raichu and it was defeated with a powerful Psychic attack. It then faced Visquez‘s Electrode. A lot of challengers come to the Vermilion City Gym with Ground-type moves and to deal with that, they trained Electrode to use Magnet Rise to control the battlefield. Despite defeating Ash`s Gengar, Pikachu was able to defeat it to win the match.",
