  "description" : "Yukiya is a Pokémon trainer that participated in the Pokémon Sumo which was part of the festival on Harvest Island that celebrates the harvest of fruit. He knocked over Ash while getting the fruit pie that Ash was going to eat. Yukiya was quite rude to Ash at the time and told him it was first come, first serve. Cilan and Iris calmed Ash down though before the argument escalated any further and Yukiya walked away. During the Pokémon Sumo, he was first matched up against Meowth who was dressed up in a Golonya costume. The match only lasted one move which sent Team Rocket flying into the sky. Yukiya made it to the finals where he was matched up against Ash. He thought he could easily defeat Ash`s Pignite, but its agile moves proved to be too much for Golurk and Ash defeated Yukiya to win the Pokémon Sumo. Alexa had told Ash and his friends about an old legend on Harvest Island where there was plenty of fruit and the people lived prosperously. But eventually, everyone wanted to eat even more delicious fruit and to claim them as their own that it led to fights breaking out. The forest gradually got ruined due to the war and there were no more fruit to pick any more. Before long, two powerful Pokémon fought for the last fruit. The two Pokémon fought harshly, but ran out of strength before the fight could be decided. Just then, a boy from the village ran up to them and gave them pieces of fruit, saying, \"It`s more tasty if you share it with others\". And so, the forest returned to its former state and continued to produce delicious fruit. The prize for winning the Pokémon Sumo was a bunch of fruit which Ash shared to the people at the festival. He then shared a fruit with Yukiya to try to mend the argument and rivalry they previously had.",
