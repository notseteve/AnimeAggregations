  "description" : "Sixth year ro class. Age 15, Scorpio, blood type AB. President of the Library Committee.\nA student who spoke with few words and with few facial expressions. Chouji who speak slowly, that made his words hard to be conveyed at times, is also the head of librarian. Usually, someone who stands besides him (such as Raizou or Kirimaru who are also librarians) had to be the `translator` especially to those who don`t meet Choji quite often. His expressions can get eerie with one big creepy smile, though his true emotions often contrast his face (such as he will smile creepily when he is hurt, and vice versa). Ironically, Shinbei`s little sister Kameko found his smile to be attractive, and even had a crush on him at times.\nSource: Wiki",
