  "description" : "Also known as \"Setsuna of the Moment of Dreams,\" is the Absolute Angel Cla√≠omh Solais (Kurau Sorasu). She fights alongside Kyoshiro as his partner. Setsuna treasures a ribbon bow with bells, which is given to her by Kyoshiro and tied to the right side of her headdress. Rarely expressing any emotion, she is physically beautiful and can carry out every household chore flawlessly, leading Kuu to call her a \"princess\". Setsuna acts solely based on Kyoshiro`s orders and wishes, not her own will, and has a habit of saying, \"Would you prefer that, Kyoshiro?\" She begins to grow jealous of Kyoshiro and Kuu`s closeness, but she holds back her feelings so as to not trouble Kyoshiro.",
