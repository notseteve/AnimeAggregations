  "description" : "Hippowdon is the evolved form of Hippopotas. Sand appears to be coming out of the holes on its back. Its mouth can span seven feet. It is also mentioned, in a bookcase in Harbor Inn in Canalave City, that this Pok√©mon created the deserts of the world, but the spirit of the desert is Flygon, and the heat was created by Camerupt. Males are colored yellow, while females are colored black. It is interesting to note that males are yellow, so that in their desert environments, they have trouble finding each other to fight. The female is colored black for the opposite reason, so she is easy to find. In the 4th gen game series for Nintendo DS, Hippowdon has the special ability called \"Sand Stream\", which whips up a sandstorm whenever it is introduced into battle. The sandstorm will continue until another weather condition is set, or if for example Rayquaza is switched in (because Rayquaza has an ability to negate weather effects).",
