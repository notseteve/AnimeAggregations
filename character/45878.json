  "description" : "Hattori suggested the two have a Pokémon battle to determine which A-class Pokémon Sommelier would get to choose the Pokémon for Momotchi. The battle was a 1-on-1 affair and Pinot Noir`s Purrloin was sent out to face Cilan`s Crustle.\nPinot Noir said his Choroneko`s speed and power even surpasses its evolved form Lepardas. It showed its speed early on in the battle and Cilan`s Crustle had a hard time hitting it. During the battle, Pinot Noir noted that Cilan`s Crustle was a good choice for Cilan in that it`s faithful to the basics but that alone was nothing but an ordinary and boring tasting. He expanded by saying that selecting Iwapalace, who is both a Rock and a Bug type, against Choroneko, a Dark type, is a standard reaction. He suggested to Cilan that an A-class Sommelier needed to have more unpredictability which Cilan`s Crustle showed by coming out of its shell and using Rock Wrecker to defeat Pinot Noir`s Purrloin. Pinot Noir admitted that Cilan`s Crustle hid an unexpected flavor.",
