  "description" : "Ash`s Melmetal is the evolved form of Ash`s Meltan. It evolved on the docks of the Manalo Stadium after spinning its nut most of the day to call in the nearby Meltan. According to Professor Samuel Oak, this unique Pokémon has been mentioned in several ancient writings. It was always referred to as Melmetal, but he never suspected that it might have evolved from a large group of Meltan combining until he saw it happen in front of him.\nIn the first match-up of the Alola League finals, Ash`s Melmetal faced off against Gladion`s Type: Null / Silvally. Everyone was surprised when Melmetal was revealed and it burst onto the scene with Double Iron Bash. It hit with a lot of power but Gladion adapted by moving around a lot. Melmetal took on massive amounts of power as soon as it evolved but Silvally’s fancy footwork proved to be hard for Melmetal to actually hit it. Half way through the battle, Silvally has changed into a Fighting-type Pokémon and attacked with Multi-Attack but Melmetal showed just how tough it is by standing its ground. Melmetal was defeated by Silvally and Pikachu came out to replace it.",
