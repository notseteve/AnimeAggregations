  "description" : "Barry the Chopper (also called \"Number 66\") is one of the two armor guards ordered by the Homunculi to kill any intruders to the Fifth Central Alchemical Laboratory. A former serial killer, he became a human test subject in the military`s alchemical experiments and, in lieu of execution, had his disembodied soul bound to a suit of armor, similar to http://anidb.net/ch5908 [Alphonse Elric]. As a result of the schism between the storylines of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga and the 2003 anime series, Barry the Chopper appears in both but is a rather different character in each.",
