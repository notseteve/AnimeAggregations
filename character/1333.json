  "description" : "Yagami Hayate, a sweet wheelchair-using orphan, is under the care of the Wolkenritter, though they keep their battles from her; she knows that the completion of the Book of Darkness will grant her vast power, but does not want it at the expense of the lives of others. However, the Book of Darkness is feeding off her own life force, causing her paralysis, and will eventually kill her if it is not completed. Hayate becomes fast friends with Suzuka after she helps her around the library, which may cause trouble if their respective friends learn that they have been fighting each other.\nAfter the events of A`s, she becomes a mage and becomes friends with Nanoha and Fate and, in StrikerS, works with them to form Riot Force 6.",
