  "description" : "Ultear is introduced as a member of the Magic Council who apparently works for Siegrain. When the members of Fairy Tail go to Galuna Island they encounter a cloaked wizard named Zalty. Zalty helps Reitei Lyon try to revive Deliora (a demon trapped in ice by Ur) and uses \"Lost Magic\" to manipulate time`s effects on inanimate objects. After Deliora is discovered to be long dead, Zalty is revealed to be Ultear, the daughter of Ur. Unsuccessful in the attempt to gain Deliora, Ultear later helps Siegrain manipulate the Magic Council in order to activate the Tower of Paradise.",
