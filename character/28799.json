  "description" : "Tajima Yuuichirou is the cleanup hitter of the team. He is an outgoing, confident, and friendly character, and very talented at baseball. However, because of his small build, he is unable to hit home runs, and relies on the team to complete runs. Tajima and Mihashi develop a friendship and is able to understand and elucidate Mihashi`s sometimes incomprehensible attempts at communication to others. Tajima enjoys catching fast balls and, as a result, becomes a back-up catcher in case of Abe`s absence and for training purposes.",
