  "description" : "The Star Goose is a small and fast military transport capable of operating in the air or in space. Though unarmed, the Star Goose is very maneuverable and its armored hull is quite robust. Many a time a SC-27 has come under heavy enemy fire and remained flight-worthy, doggedly carrying passengers wherever needed. In times of combat, the craft features interior saftey seats that enclose the passenger in a fully sealed unit to protect against hull breaches. When travelling from the surface to orbit, the Star Goose makes use of a booster rocket to escape the atmosphere.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/stargoose.htm",
