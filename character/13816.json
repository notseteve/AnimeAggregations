  "description" : "Lillia is the main female protagonist of the series` second part. She is Allison`s and Wil`s daughter, but is kept ignorant of Travas` true identity as Wil. She knows almost nothing about Treize and does not know that he is the Prince of Ikstova. She is shy of being called by her full name, Lilliane Acacia Coraz√≥n Whittington Schultz. She is, as her mother mutters in a monologue, as dense as Wilhelm when it comes to romance.",
