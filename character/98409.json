  "description" : "Kamoshida Suguru was the PE teacher and volleyball coach at Shuujin Academy. A former Olympic medallist, he brought the school`s volleyball team to the national level, which permitted him to get away with sexually harassing the female team members and subjecting the male team members to brutal physical abuse which he justified as \"training\". With no one able to stop his abusive behaviour, he began to see himself as a king with the Academy as his castle. After Ren and Ryuuji face expulsion at his hand and Ann`s best friend Shiho tries to kill herself after being sexually molested by him, he becomes the first target for a change of heart by what will become known as the Phantom Thieves.",
