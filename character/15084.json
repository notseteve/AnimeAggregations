  "description" : "During a battle against the New UNE`s massive (and beam weapon-proof) NRX-010 Gable mobile suit, Roybea Loy`s GT-9600 Gundam Leopard was heavily damaged, as his was the only unit among the Freeden`s mobile suit complement armed with a significant number of conventional, non-beam weapons. Following the battle, the Freeden`s ever-resourceful mobile suit mechanic, young Kid Salsamille, set to work to rebuild Roybea`s suit. The refurbished unit was renamed GT-9600-D Gundam Leopard Destroy, and its weaponry loadout was overhauled, replacing many of its old conventional arms with a greater number of beam weapons. As a result, the Leopard Destroy`s armament was now considered more \"well-balanced\", thus helping Roybea to better use his Gundam against the increasingly powerful New UNE military.",
