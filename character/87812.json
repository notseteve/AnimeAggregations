  "description" : "Ivalera is an elf of the Pisky race and descendant of the ancient Spirits of the Wind. She is a member of http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts]` Traveling Party and a lifelong friend to http://anidb.net/ch87813 [Schierke].\nJust like the others of her race, she is an empath, able to feel the emotions of others. In time, Ivalera learned how to \"finetune\" this ability with the feelings of Schierke, acting in a protective, almost motherly way to protect her from distress, and counseling the other members of the party on what to do when Schierke, overexerting herself, falls in a state of trance too deep to awaken alone. Outwardly more serious and reliable than http://anidb.net/ch81095 [Puck], Ivalera often share with him moments of bickering and fighting, enhancing their value of the \"comic relief\" characters.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
