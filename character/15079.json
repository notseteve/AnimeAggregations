  "description" : "In the chaos following the apocalyptic end of the 7th Space War, Vultures roamed the Earth gathering old technology left over from the United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army. Many Vultures used land battleships such as the Alps class on their scavenging journeys. The Alps class ship Freeden was captained by Jamil Neate, a former Newtype who fought as a UNE soldier during the 7th Space War and piloted the GX-9900 Gundam X that destroyed a space colony and set off the SRA`s massive colony drop. Although the Freeden`s crew collected old mobile suits like other Vultures, Jamil had another purpose in mind - find and protect Newtypes. One such Newtype was Tiffa Adill, whom Jamil rescued from the Alternative Company`s research lab in April A.W. 0015. After Garrod Ran joined the crew with his Gundam X, the Freeden set out on a worldwide journey to find Newtypes and contact them. During this journey, the Freeden encountered the New United Nations Earth military, which was conquering the world to unify it. After the New UNE is founded in July A.W. 0015, the Freeden makes landfall in South Asia and joins the People`s Republic of Estard in its fight against the New UNE. Following the fall of Estard, the Freeden traveled to the New UNE`s Newtype Research Facility, where Tiffa was kidnapped by an SRA spy and taken to space. While fighting to send Garrod and his GX-9901-DX Gundam Double X, the Freeden was destroyed when it rammed into the New UNE`s land fortress Bandaal.",
