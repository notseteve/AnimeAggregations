  "description" : "Chris Krana is an alleged teenage son of Galza`s leader Min Durk and a Nafrecian woman, whose maiden name he adopted. After his mother`s death, Chris tried to travel to Gazth-Sonika to meet with his father (whom he never knew personally), but Enfant prevented him from entering the country. In the end, a Nafrecian civil servant Piederico Moré secretly \"smuggled\" Chris into the country and hired Madlax as his bodyguard.\nWith Madlax`s help, Chris reached Galza`s headquarters, but hasn`t found his father there. Instead, Friday Monday explained to him, that Min Durk was just a red herring created by Enfant, and that he, Chris Krana, thus, cannot exist. Krana`s ultimate fate is unknown.\nIn episode 21, while Carrossea and Margaret perform the ritual, a young Chirs Krana appeared with Margaret and Poupée during the plane crash in 1999, this explains most of Krana`s mysteries.",
