  "description" : "Originally a poor rural girl from the village of Wasilica, Mirim sought to escape poverty by seeking a job at the Queen`s Capital. It was there that she was brought in by Ymir as a test subject for her \"Strongest Project\", and became a member of the Queen`s Army under a high-paying salary. She is equipped with the Ultra-Vibration Armor and armed with the Ultra-Vibration Sword Infinite Slasher - a sword with a chainsaw-like edge, and the Ultra-Vibration shield, all of which are powered by the Ultra-Vibration Crystal. Despite being given the armor and weapons, she has a weak-willed personality. She eventually leaves the Queen`s Army for the Rebel Army after her home village was destroyed by Ymir, and calls Annelotte \"Big Sister\". Created by Hagane Tsurugi.\nSource: Wikipedia",
