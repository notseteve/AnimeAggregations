  "description" : "As the successor to Ptolemaios I, Ptolemaios II is a dramatic improvement over its predecessor. Ptolemy 2 is a multi-purpose MS transport carrier, capable of operating in space, atmosphere, and sea. Ptolemy 2 overall is designed to be a self sustainable warship, capable of providing combat support to their Gundams and/or Meisters in various combat situations on extended periods of time. The ship has atmospheric re-entry capabilities and capable of returning to space on its own. In addition, Ptolemy II is also a submarine. The ship is capable of diving underwater for infiltration and stealth operations.\nThe ship no longer uses a docking ring for launching Gundams or portable MS containers, it has a large MS container bay that directly loads their Gundams onto the two linear catapults to launch mobile units in shorter launching times. The MS container bay of the ship was designed to accommodate their Gundams and mobile support units. During underwater operations, the bottom of the bay can open for underwater launching or retrieval.\nThe ship is loaded with an arsenal of weapons for self defensive/offensive purposes and able to hold its own without the need of a Gundam. The ship can traditionally use high GN particle dispersal for stealth and GN Field for protection, but also have a holographic camouflage system to avoid detection. The ship was also designed to utilize the power of the Gundams, when speed and power is needed, the ship can utilize the Gundam`s Trans-Am system to temporarily enhance it`s capabilities and launch straight into space. Overall, Ptolemy 2 is a highly formidable and versatile warship.",
