  "description" : "The Grand Canal was an Alliance cruiser, pennant number 613R. It was assigned as part of a force of ten cruisers and destroyers to escort approximately one hundred merchant ships from nearby starzones to Alliance patrol units deployed in the Iserlohn Corridor in January 795 UC, in preparation for the Third Battle of Tiamat. Its fellow ships abandoned their mission, but the Grand Canal`s Captain Fegan elected to remain behind complete the escort. The merchant fleet was soon attacked by two Imperial cruisers. Outnumbered, the Grand Canal was destroyed, but fought long enough for all but two of the civilian ships to escape.\nThe Grand Canal is based on the World War II British armed merchant cruiser HMS Jervis Bay, which was the sole escort for a convoy of merchant ships. Upon encountering superior opposition, the Jervis Bay sacrificed itself to buy time for the convoy to escape. Its captain Edward Fegen was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions.\nGineipedia",
