  "description" : "The picket is a patrol ship used by the Zentradi fleets for advance reconnaissance. Prior to any main fleet entering a potentially hostile or unexplored area of space, the picket ships are sent in to scout and report back to the command ship. When the Zentradi 67th Glruimual class branch http://anidb.net/ch10514 [Vrlitwhai] (Adoclass) Fleet entered the Sol system to find the crashed Supervision Army ship, two pickets were sent ahead to the planet upon which it crashed. The rebuilt http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], having been set with an automated defense booby trap, fired upon the pickets and destroyed them both with a single shot. At 500 meters in length, the pickets were the smallest Zentradi capital ships seen in Space War I.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/picket.htm",
