  "description" : "The protagonist of the series, Miharu is a 14-year-old middle school student. Despite being the holder of Nabari`s most powerful hijutsu, the coveted Shinrabanshou, and as such is venerated by all of Nabari`s ninjas as its `king`, Miharu cares little about his gift`s profound merits, his only goal being to inherit the family`s okonomiyaki store. He tends to act indifferent to those around him in order to protect them from getting hurt, though he is not averse to acting in a rather innocent and cute way in order to get what he wants, and actually yearns for love at heart.",
