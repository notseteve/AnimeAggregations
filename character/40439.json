  "description" : "Robert`s Grandpa is a Pok√©mon photographer who once took a picture of all four season forms of Mebukijika together. Robert carries his photobook and his grandpa`s photobook in his backpack to show people some of the pictures. In the photobook is that picture of all four seasonal forms of Mebukijika gathered in one place. Robert`s Grandpa is very proud of that picture. It fills him with great pride to have taken that photograph as it was a wonderful experience that no one else could have created.\nCilan and Iris couldn`t believe that Robert`s Grandpa took a picture of all four seasonal forms of Mebukijika gathered in one place. Many of Robert`s friends actually called the photo a fake and this frustrated him so much that he vowed to search for the forest where his grandpa met the Mebukijika and take the same photograph, no matter what. His only clue was a picture that had a Antres flower which is very rare that was in his grandpa`s photos.",
