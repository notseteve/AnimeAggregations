  "description" : "Brock said that Ash`s Pidgeotto would stand up to any kind of attack if it was to protect Ash from harm.\nWhile walking through a forest near Pallet Town, Ash realizes the Spearow that he hit with his Pokeball on the first day that he was on his journey must have evolved into a Fearow. A bunch of Pidgey and Pidgeotto were stuck in a tree and were too afraid to leave it. Ash`s Pidgeotto helped them be brave enough to leave but just as they did the Fearow attacked Ash`s Pidgeotto and injured it. Realizing that the Pidgey and Pidgeotto were still in trouble, Ash`s Pidgeotto evolved into a Pidgeot.\nKanto Pok√©mon League\nJust before Ash`s fifth round battle against Ritchie, Jessie had tricked Ash into leaving the arena by impersonating Ritchie. Jessie, James and Meowth all delayed from reaching the arena and Pidgeotto had to use all of its energy in helping Ash get to the arena before he was disqualified. Unfortunately, due to the amount of energy Pidgeotto had used up, Ash decided not to use it in the fifth round.",
