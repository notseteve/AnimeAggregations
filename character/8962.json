  "description" : "Araragi Koyomi, the main character of the story, is a third year high school student who is close to failing every class except maths.\nShortly before the story begins, he was attacked by vampire during spring break, and became a vampire himself. Although http://anidb.net/ch8967 [Oshino Meme] helped him become human again, there are a few lingering side effects; he can see in the dark, and he heals faster than the average human. He is still scared of morning sunlight even though it no longer has any effect on him.",
