  "description" : "Professor Sebastian is a member of Team Rocket who has appeared in several episodes of the Pokémon anime.\nHe appeared in \"The Legend of Thunder!\", and later on in the main series during \"Talkin` `Bout an Evolution\" and \"Rage of Innocence\".\nEvery occasion he is seen by the viewer, he remains calm and talks with a steady even tone. As he is only seen in moments of scientific importance and victory, it cannot be said if this demeanor carries over to every situation, or if this behavior has been modulated to the scientific environment and all business that stems from there on in.\nSome within fanon speculate that he might be the most powerful Rocket scientist. Not taking in other issues, one can say that he has spent an impressive amount time working for the group.\nHe works with Tyson and gives commands to Hun and Attila. Tyson seems to hold at least his scientific mind in great regard. As Hun, Attila, and Tyson are of the same rank, Sebastian might work with agents of their rank often.\nHe is in charge of a sizeable crew of scientists, and they seem to work on a variety of things. He is known for the creation of the crystal system that traps Electric-type Pokémon with their own power and a beam that forces Pokémon to evolve.\nThe origin of his Japanese name is probably after the sword style Shiranui-ryu. Humorously, Jessie refers to him as \"pointy\" when she meets him.",
