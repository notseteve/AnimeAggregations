  "description" : "Sabato is another angel sent from the future to assassinate Sakura before he can create his \"Pedophile`s World\". Also with super-human strength, Sabato has ram horns on her head. After she was defeated, she began to live in a small cardboard box under a bridge; her living allowance is funded from an unknown source. Her weapon of choice is a deadly shock-baton called Durandal which according to Sabato can \"char blue whales in the blink of an eye.\" \"Durandal\" is most likely a reference to Durendal, the sword of Charlemagne`s paladin Roland.",
