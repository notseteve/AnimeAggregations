  "description" : "Fila is another council member of The Third. She and Joganki have a close working relationship, but they don`t always agree. Fila is often impetuous, coming to quick decisions that are a bit harsher than Joganki might like. And Joganki often lets his interest in Honoka colour his actions, which Fila just can`t understand. But in the end, the two respect each other completely. Fila is very serious and formal, almost like royalty - but despite her frosty appearance, she does have her own quiet form of kindness.",
