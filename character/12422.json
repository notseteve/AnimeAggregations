  "description" : "Kairi is tall, despite being two years junior to Amu. Unlike the spontaneous Kukai, Kairi is intelligent, uptight, very organized, and blunt about faults. Even with these traits, he is so capable that Amu and Yaya call him \"class president\". He can also become very shy in certain situations. He has a tendency to be the \"planner\" of the group, ad he usually leads the meetings and instructs what is to be done by each member.",
