  "description" : "Barboach lives in muddy areas of riverbeds. It probes this mud with its whiskers before deciding where to bury itself underneath the level of the mud, so that it remains motionless while its top whiskers are poking above the surface. The whiskers act as a superb radar system in this position, for Barboach detects its prey in the area using its whiskers to sense disturbances in the air.\nBarboach`s body is covered with a slimy film, which is an important measure of discouraging both bacteria and predators from targeting Barboach. Whenever Barboach is partially submerged in mud, the film functions as a barrier to prevent germs in the mud from entering Barboach`s otherwise thin, unprotected body. Also, if a predator attempts to grab it, the Pokemon effortlessly slips out of its grasp as if it were a bar of wet, flexible soap like the real world Hagfish. It would seem that Barboach`s body depends on keeping its slimy coating layer thick and fluid with the influence of muddy water because the Pokemon`s body weakens if the coating dries up.",
