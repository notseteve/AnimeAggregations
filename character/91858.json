He gains large, white-feathered wings that he is able to use in his human form. In his transformed state his feathers turn grey and harden giving a similar appearance to closed fists. His body becomes completely encased in the hardened feathers giving him an armored, scaly appearance.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
