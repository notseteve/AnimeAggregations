  "description" : "It is one of the few Pokémon whose name is the same in all languages. Roselia`s name is a portmanteau of \"rose\" and \"rosalia\", a type of melody. The species of flower, \"azalea\" may be another influence of its name. Another possible root of its name might be the country \"Bulgaria\", famous for its Rose Valley. In a demo of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl played at PokéJungle, a new Pokémon made its appearance, the evolved form of Roselia named Roserade, as Ken Sugimori had announced at the Pokémon Garden site; Ken Sugimori later stated the possibility of a pre-evolved form of Roselia as well, which was revealed to be Budew.",
