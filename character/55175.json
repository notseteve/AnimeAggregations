  "description" : "The Chimera Ant Queen (女王) is the first chimera ant to be seen in the series, having mysteriously mutated to about two meters tall instead of their typical height of ten centimeters. She first appears having washed up injured on the shores of the autonomous region of Neo-Green Life (or simply NGL), a small insular nation located on an island known as the Mitene Union. Driven by her reproductive instincts to give birth to a Chimera Ant King with ideal traits, the Queen immediately begins to feed on small mammals and aquatic life in order to give birth to soldier ants to bring her larger prey in greater amounts. When one brings her two-human children to feed on, she notes them to be more nourishing then previous prey and becomes obsessed, sending her soldiers to concentrate on gathering more humans to feed on. NGL`s status as neo-Luddite enables the Queen`s offspring to be unopposed before their activities are eventually learned by the outside world. The Queen is fatally injured when the Chimera Ant King forces his own premature birth, damaging her organs with massive blood loss.\nSource: Wikipedia",
