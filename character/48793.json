  "description" : "A next generation aircraft evolving from the hypersonic lifting-body Superbird series of unmanned fighter-bombers, the QF-3000E became an all-environment unmanned craft used throughout the U.N. forces. As an unmanned spaceplane the \"Ghost\" was aptly named like previous AI-controlled craft but the QF-3000E is much larger than its predecessors. Carrying numerous cannons and internal missiles makes the Ghost a potent weapon and the craft is often used in large numbers, sometimes equaling the manned fighter compliment onboard some U.N. carrier ships. At the beginning of Space War One in February 2009, there were 120 QF-3000E`s stationed aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] with a further 270 units deployed on ARMD-01.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/qf3000e-ghost.htm",
