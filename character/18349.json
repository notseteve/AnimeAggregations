  "description" : "Seki Jouji is a student who used to love beautiful girls and turned into a narcissist, to the point that he usually goes to school in makeup. He goes on and on about how lovely a girl can be, if she uses the right products. Outside school, he has been seen in skirts and even a full ladies` kimono. Despite the two of them often stating that they dislike each other, he seems to have a good relationship with Kobayashi.",
