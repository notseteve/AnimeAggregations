  "description" : "Zanaffar is a chimera, created by the inappropriate usage of a magical process written in the Claire Bible, which originally described the creation of the so-called Zenaffa armor. The Zanaffar created by Copy Rezo was voiced by Koyasu Takehito (who also voiced Copy Rezo) and the Zanaffar that appears in Slayers REVOLUTION is voiced by Ishii Kouji.\nThe four legged silver beast has roughly the size of a medium dragon, and the head of a wolf. Whip-like tentacles sprout from its torso. It is not surely known which creatures serve as components to the chimera; it does seem to have, however, a connection to the golden dragons, as Zanaffar is able to use the same laser breath that they possess. It can be shot either from its mouth or from its tentacles.\nSource: http://kanzaka.wikia.com/wiki/Zanaffar",
