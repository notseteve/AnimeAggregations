  "description" : "Bruno`s Onix was a wild Onix that traveled on Mt. Hideaway and tried to trample anyone in its path. After Bruno saved Ash after he had fallen into a pit inhabited by it, Bruno eventually figured out what was troubling the Onix. A Sandslash had lodged itself in between one of the Onix` many rocks. After Bruno removed the Sandslash from the Onix, he asked the Onix if it wanted to come along with him, to which the Onix happily agreed.",
