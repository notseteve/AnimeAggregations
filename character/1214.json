  "description" : "Honchkrow evolves from a Murkrow exposed to a Dusk Stone. It resembles a large black raven, with a crest on its head resembling a fedora hat. Its name comes from the phrase \"The Head Honcho\" which is a nickname for the leader of a group. Honchkrow spends most of its time grooming itself in its nest, while it dispatches its Murkrow minions to bring it food. However, it sometimes flies with them in tow. This creature was introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Team Galactic Boss Cyrus uses Honchkrow in his final battle. In Pokemon Platinum it is also used in his second battle. Honchkrow and its pre-evolution, Murkrow, are exclusive to Pokémon Diamond version: Pearl players instead can catch Midreavus and Mismagius.\nIn the Pokémon anime, Paul owns a Honchkrow.",
