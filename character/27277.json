It makes the dreams it ate materialize. The smoke leaking from its forehead changes form into the things from the dreams.\nMusharna appears in Black and White episode 6, \"Dreams by the Yard Full\", under the ownership of Fennel.\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava criticized Musharna, stating the way it emits dreams from its forehead, calling it \"terrifying!\"",
