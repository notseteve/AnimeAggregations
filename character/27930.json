She is working with Seta because Seta knew her grandfather and she wants to continue his work now that he is dead.\nNyamo is physically almost identical to Shinobu - except having darker skin and longer hair - and shares a number of other traits with her as well, including her extreme initial shyness and reluctance to speak. Nyamo and Shinobu quickly become good friends and correspond when apart. In the manga, she`s last seen attending Keitarou`s wedding. Also in the manga, when she visits the Hinata Dorms, she brings with her a pet giant tortoise named Gidget.",
