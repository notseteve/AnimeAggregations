  "description" : "Christopf von Köfenhiller was a captain in the Imperial Fleet, who was captured by the Free Planets Alliance during the Second Battle of Tiamat. He was born in 717 UC and died early in the morning on New Year`s Day 789 UC at the age of 71.\n\nAfter surrendering to the Free Planets Alliance during the Second Battle of Tiamat, Köfenhiller and his compatriots were detained in the Alliance`s internment camp on the planet Econia, in the Thanatos Starzone. While most of his fellow prisoners deeply desired to return home, Köfenhiller did not care. He relished in the fact that, so long as he remained alive and imprisoned on the other side of the galaxy, his wife would never be able to divorce him or marry her lover.\nKöfenhiller assumed the responsibility of writing to the families of prisoners who died while in the POW camp, and soon became an authority figure. In the course of his 40-year stay at the camp, many Alliance officers came to respect him, and tried to get him preferential treatment for a prisoner exchange with the Empire, but each time, Köfenhiller refused. He spent most of his time researching the mysterious events surrounding the defection of Imperial admiral Martin Otto von Siegmeister and the murder of Imperial admiral Christoph von Michaelsen, eventually coming to believe that both men had been involved in a conspiracy culminating in the murder of Alliance hero, Bruce Ashbey.",
