  "description" : "Slakoth is a sloth-like Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. Like what its name and anatomy suggest, Slakoth is extremely lazy, and its daily routine is extremely uneventful, and since it uses and requires so little energy, it sustains itself on three leaves a day and its heart beats once per minute. Slakoth is one of the most proficient sleepers in the Pokémon world, sleeping 20 hours a day (compare with Abra), and it is clearly not worried about possible predators in the area. Onlookers get sleepy themselves when looking at a Slakoth, in fact. Once in a great while, though, Slakoth can summon a surprising amount of energy and effort to travel great distances by swimming along rivers.",
