  "description" : "He is the Shinigami`s current weapon and Maka`s father, formerly known as Spirit (still called by a few people including Shinigami and Stein). He is very protective of Maka and is ready to jump to her aid any time she is in trouble, but he is always stopped by the Shinigami. His wife was Maka`s mother, but they divorced shortly before the start of the story due to his constant flirting with other women. Even though he visits clubs, he is still insanely loyal to his ex-wife and daughter. He usually runs yelling about how much he loves Maka and her mother (he calls Maka`s mother Mama). He is extremely sad that his daughter hates him, but he still tries to be a good father by looking out for her in his own silly way. Spirit is consistently shown to be a warm, caring, sensitive, and kind-hearted man. Aside from his love for Maka, he is compassionate towards children in general.",
