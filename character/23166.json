  "description" : "The Gells-Ghe is part of a series of huge mobile armors developed for the Earth Alliance by Adukurf Mechano-Industries. Like the Zamza-Zah, it is equipped with a positron reflector capable of deflecting any enemy attack, and since this system is mounted on the front of its body the Gells-Ghe is ideal for defending fixed positions such as Gulnahan`s Lohengrin Gate. This unusual machine is also distinguished by its six insect-like legs and by the mobile suit torso, derived from the old Strike Dagger, that serves as its upper body. The Gells-Ghe is controlled by a three-person crew in the same fashion as the Zamza-Zah.",
