  "description" : "Kabuto is an extinct Pokémon that can be revived through dome fossils, though some living examples have been found. Remaining unchanged for 300 million years, it is an aquatic Pokémon that hides on the sea floor, which is how some Kabuto became fossils in the first place. While concealed, Kabuto leaves exposed only its hard shell, which protects it from any attacks, while the glowing eyes on its back allow it to continue monitoring its surroundings. If it is flipped upside down, it becomes helpless and defenseless as it is unable to flip over on its own. According to the anime, oil extracted from a Kabuto is rumored to have interesting medical properties, longevity being one of them.",
