  "description" : "A mysterious boy who transfers to Magami High School in his senior year. He is often shown as being very silent and carefree, but he actually has more insight on the people around him. He usually hangs out with Kyouichi and helps him fight gangsters from other schools, giving him the status of the fifth most delinquent student in Magami High School`s history. Tatsuma is probably the only one in the group who is close to Kyouichi and would often calmly tease and irritate him.",
