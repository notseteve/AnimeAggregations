  "description" : "Unlike the rest of IGO`s Biotopes, the 0th Biotope is located in the Gourmet World and its existence is a secret from the world at large. It is located on the Cloud Tree in Gourmet World. Curently its members are either trying to locate or prepare Acacia`s Full Course Menu, or preparing for a possible war against the Bishokukai.\nIt is also unusual in that its staff, who number less than 20, are not IGO employees, but are all private citizens who have other professions when not at the Biotope. They are called \"the best of the best,\" and are all chosen by the IGO president, Ichiryuu.",
