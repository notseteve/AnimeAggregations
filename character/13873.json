She moved to Colony Loca A2 along with her pet robot cat Chako. She is a born leader and always seems to bring out the good in everyone. She seems to always be happy, although the thought of her father`s death still holds deep in her heart. She doesn`t like to see anyone hurt, and will go out of her way to save someone. Although her plans all have good intentions, sometimes they don`t turn out the way she wants them to. Luna has powers that nobody else has and her powers can be considered as telepathy. Luna can speak to Adam by telepathy.",
