  "description" : "Poliwrath is the evolution of Poliwhirl, and resembles it closely, save for a pair of white eyes, thicker arms, and a slightly differently-shaped \"head area,\" giving more of the impression that it is like a boxer. Poliwrath is only humbled in its pack by Politoed, the leader of Poli packs.\nPoliwrath is a master swimmer in every respect, due to its highly developed body and arm muscles that never fatigue regardless of use. Thanks to its incredible stamina, Poliwrath is said to be physically able to swim the entire diameter of Earth`s Pacific Ocean without obvious effort, and its swimming efficiency allows it to easily overtake the best human swimmers in any controlled competition.\nPoliwrath has made several appearances in the Pokemon anime, first appearing in \"The Battling Eevee Brothers\" and later as an opponent in \"Charizard Chills\" and \"Hook, Line, and Sinker.\"",
