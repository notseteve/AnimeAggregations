  "description" : "Lum`s childhood friend. Her character is named after Shichifukujin Benzaiten (one of the Seven Lucky Gods), the Shinto goddess of knowledge, art, and beauty. This Benten is a \"space biker chick\" who wears a plate-mail bikini, sports a \"butch\" hair style, tears around the sky on a flying alien chopper, curses like a longshoreman, and carries a high-tech bazooka. She holds an annual battle against Lum`s Oni clan on Setsubun. Aside from being a good hand-to-hand fighter and having the aforementioned bazooka, she appears to have no special powers. As children, Benten and Lum often instigated trouble that usually resulted in Ran getting hurt.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
