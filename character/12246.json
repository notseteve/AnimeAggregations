  "description" : "Emperor Zwordar the Great is the undisputed leader of the Comet Empire, whose sole aim in life is to conquer and subjugate the Universe. To this aim, he travels space in an enormous city-planet, Gatlantis, surrounded by a powerful plasma shield which resembles a gigantic comet, capable of annihilating entire planets in its path, and launching fleets of warships to conquer any useful worlds - or destroy them if they resist. Having subjugated the entire Andromeda Galaxy, his next target is Earth. His name is based on the word \"sword\".",
