His Regalia, \"Ram Jet\", is able to absorb wind, completely nullifying the \"wind\" of anyone and decreasing their air time. After Ikki impresses him by completing a challenge he helps train and advise Kogarasumaru until Sora takes over Genesis. He decides to keep his alliance with Genesis as it will be beneficial to Trident and he wishes to one day fight against Kogarasumaru. He is a skilled Air Trekker, able to substitute empty cans as his Ram Jet Regalia and is an extremely skilled Tetris player. He is also capable of fighting on par with the Gravity Children. However, in the recent battle of Genesis vs. Trident, Yoshitsune has been confirmed to be dead. After destroying the mecha that invaded Osaka and killing the two members of Genesis, Gawain and Percival, Yoshitsune is unable to fight and is finished off by Nike.",
