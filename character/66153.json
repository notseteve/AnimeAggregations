  "description" : "Tesla`s main partner is Fletchling. In his debut Battle Chateau match, it faced Pikachu. Unfortuantely for Tesla`s Fletchling, Pikachu had a super effective type advantage over it and also had a lot more battle experience so it wasn`t long until Pikachu was able to defeat it. Ash Ketchum was awarded the title of Baron for winning the match. Tesla was polite and little frustrated but he congratulated Ash Ketchum and looked forward to his next match by vowing to train harder with his brother.",
