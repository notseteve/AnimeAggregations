  "description" : "She is a very shy girl who has low self-esteem and will often says things are \"impossible\" if she thinks they are too much for her to handle. Despite being terrified about being the center of attention, she gets unwillingly drafted into the Drama Research Society but stays after she discovers the determination from the three older members of the club. Mugi especially admires Nono`s determination after learning about her affliction with her vocal cords. When Mugi starts to panic, Nono can easily calm her down enough for her to carry out her acting duties. When stressed, or sometimes merely by chance, Mugi is submerged in delusions when she imagines herself in strange scenarios.",
