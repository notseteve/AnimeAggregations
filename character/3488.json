  "description" : "Soul Eater, \"Soul\" to his friends, is Maka`s Demon Scythe partner; his human appearance is that of a teenage boy, and his attitude is like one also. Soul`s personality mostly consists of what he considers \"cool\". Being a \"cool\" guy, he almost always uses the direct approach which most of the time fails, and even drives a motorcycle, which both he and Maka use for transportation. He sometimes becomes too driven by the idea of eating souls, which leads him to bicker with Maka, but in the end they remain friends and partners. He may be in love with her as he is \"willing to die for his technician\". He is also friends with Black Star because of their similar personalities, but at the same time they cannot match each other`s wavelength.",
