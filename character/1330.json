  "description" : "Kentaro is Yuuji`s father. He first made his appearance in the second season of the anime. He usually resides outside Japan, but enjoys making sudden visits to the Sakai household, surprising his family. Despite his skinny figure, his athletic senses are good enough to retaliate a flying kick from Shana without scratch, who was mistaken that he was an enemy.",
