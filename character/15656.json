  "description" : "A Level 2 telepath, Chisato is one of The Children`s classmates that has a warm childhood history with Masaru Touno. Curious about whether he will still accept her after learning that she is an esper, Chisato reads Touno`s thoughts to learn that he sees her for the person she is before her telepathy but makes the mistake of sharing the news. Chisato demonstrates the tendency to assume culpability for Touno`s aversion for all espers as well as his conflict with Kaoru.",
