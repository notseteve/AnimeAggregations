  "description" : "Kurono Kei is one of the two main protagonists of the series. He is a 10th grader who is summoned by Gantz, along with his childhood friend http://anidb.net/ch11788 [Katou Masaru], after being hit by a subway train in an effort to help a hobo who passes out on the tracks.\nIn the beginning, he is a rather selfish character, with a penchant for sexual perversity, who often ends up being the reluctant hero. However, after Katou dies in the third mission, Kei starts taking care of other people as well, and he starts to avoid casualties amongst Gantz team members. His innate skills and physical prowess eventually make him a hero to most of the other members.\nDuring missions, Kei often uses unconventional tactics to great effect. He lives alone in an apartment complex, as he was not on good terms with his family. After reviving some of his former friends, Kei leaves the game due to a request from his comrades. The vampires group searches and eventually finds Kei, killing him.\nAfter the first mission of Phase 2, he is revived by Kato Masaru but remembers nothing beyond his choice to leave after the Oni Mission. After the failed Italian mission, Gantz revives an additional copy of Kurono at Reika`s request, unknown to the others. After meeting the original Kurono, he decides to live with Reika.\nSource: Wikipedia",
