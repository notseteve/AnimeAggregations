  "description" : "Canti is a robot with what looks like a television set for a head. After having his head broken by Haruko, he is recruited by her as an assistant; however, he proves to be no good for much other than washing dishes and fetching drinks for the family.\nHe was manufactured by Medical Mechanica, but taken over by Atomsk as a way to escape them. Atomsk can manifest through Canti, with Naota being the catalyst. Atomsk`s symbol appears on Canti`s screen when he absorbs Naota; the symbol is a corruption of the kanji characters for \"adult\" (大人). This symbol also appears on him when Naota \"swings the bat\" in Full Swing. The symbol that appears when Canti is absorbed by the terminal core in FLCLimax is similar, but he uses the characters for \"child\" (小人) instead. When Naota is absorbed, Canti`s physical strength is increased and he gains the ability to transform into a canon, that utilizes pilot as a munition.\nThe emotions of Canti are very human-like, despite his looks. He is embarrassed about his broken head (where Haruko hit him) and is looking for the pieces to glue back together in episode two. He wears the box on the back of his head for the same reason. Canti seems to like porn, as he was reading it in the 7-11. It is also stated in the novel, that Canti spends 3 hours at a time looking through `perverted magazines.` He is also extremely polite, extending a helping hand to Lieutenant Kitsurubami even after she attempted to destroy him.\nCanti also dons a halo and fake wings which Haruko puts on him earlier in the episode. Mamimi is convinced that Canti is an angel. She calls him \"Canti-sama\" after \"The Lord of Black Flames\" in a video game she plays. The rest of the cast call him by this title throughout the rest of the series.",
