  "description" : "Harmony is a Fire-type fan and a circus performer. The top stars of the circus are Harmony, who likes Fire-type Pokémon, and Billy, who likes Electric-type Pokémon. She does breathtaking performances with her Pokémon. The two had been performing during practice but the truth is that they were rivals because they thought that their Pokémon type were the best.\nAfter a disagreement with Billy, they dropped their evolution stones which got mixed up and their partner Pokémon evolved into the wrong types. Harmony`s Eevee (Bernice) was supposed to evolve into a Flareon during the performance but during practice, Billy`s Thunder Stone touched it and it evolved into Harmony`s Jolteon (Bernice). She was sad after it evolved because it couldn`t use Fire-type moves with the rest of the team for their performance.\nWith some help from Chloe`s Eevee and it showing its Copycat move, they got the idea to use their moves from the opposite side trapezes for Billy`s Flareon (Toril) and Harmony`s Jolteon (Bernice) at the start of the performance so that their type mismatch now seemed to be part of the show. Despite her initial disappointment with the Thunder Stone evolving her Eevee into a Jolteon, she began to see the appeal for Electric-type Pokémon. As thanks for helping out, she gave Chloe a Fire Stone.",
