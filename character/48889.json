  "description" : "Similar to the http://anidb.net/ch48821 [M-299], the GN XM-3002 is a six-wheeled variable terrain vehicle designed to operate in low-gravity conditions on terrestrial bodies with little or no atmosphere. The XM-3002 has room for four passengers (including driver) and features small thruster nozzles along the sides of the vehicle (including two top mounted omni-directional nozzle bulbs) for low gravity maneuvering. Like most utility vehicles, the XM-3002 has a communications system that can be linked with the internal units in personal space suits. First Lieutenant http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] operated an XM-3002 during the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross] landing on the planet Mars, in which she drove from the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [Macross] to Mars Base Salla.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/gnxm3002.htm",
