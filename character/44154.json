  "description" : "100 years ago, Bake-bake (\"bakemono\" = ghost, apparition) was sealed into a Boddhisatva statue by a former shrine maiden on Airantou but he was set free when http://anidb.net/ch8588 [Suzu] accidentally broke that statue. What kind of mischievous intent this ghost might originally had is unknown; his current existence is completely harmless and cute rather than fearsome. http://anidb.net/ch8589 [Ikuto] (who denies the existence of anything supernatural) considers Bake-bake a white bear. Bake-bake can use its extremely long tongue for slapping anyone considered an enemy.",
