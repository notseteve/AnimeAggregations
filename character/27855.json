  "description" : "Reiko Yuuki is a woman with a high degree of knowledge concerning curses, fortune telling and all things related to the Occult. This fascination of hers often leads her to conflict with Switch, who only is willing to accept things based in scientific fact. In spite of their natural rivalry and mutual animosity, however, Yuuki actually gets along with Switch quite well (and vice versa).",
