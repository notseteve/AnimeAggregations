  "description" : "A space warship that originally belonged to Maruba, who called it \"Will-O`-The-Wisp.\" Orga seizes it when he founds Tekkadan, and changes it name to \"Isaribi.\" One of the non-Gjallarhorn warships equipped with an Ahab reactor, it is an armored assault ship that was used during the Calamity War era, and subsequently upgraded. It has many gun turrets, but these cannot deliver a decisive blow against nanolaminate armor, and so its main attack method is ramming with its sturdy armored bow.\nSource: en.gundam.info",
