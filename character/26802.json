Misty originally thought that Melody was a `big showoff` and was a bit jealous of her but later became friends with her. She took over as the Legend Festival maiden from her sister where she had to learn how to play the ocarina.\nMelody felt responsible for Ash and Maren getting caught in the storm and decided to go after them in her sisters boat to make sure they were okay. She proved to be quite good at driving the speedboat and she said that she had been around boats all her life.\nShe played the ocarina at the at the shrine that helped Lugia recover even though she wanted to go help Ash at the time. By the time Ash and his friends were leaving, she had formed a good friendship with them as the trials they went through together proved to be a strengthening force for her.",
