  "description" : "Hiroto is the captain of the Pokémon Gulf Coast Relief Corps which operates out of Pokéwood. Saving the lives of humans or Pokémon in a dangerous situation is what`s most important to him. He has a truly life-threatening job but that`s why he and his Pokémon works well together as a team. He is very understanding of his Pokémon and tries to take each of his team members suggestions into consideration before making the final decisions as Captain of the Pokémon Gulf Coast Relief Corps. His Pokémon all respect him greatly because of his ideals and attitude of helping others.\nWhile on a training exercise, Hiroto met Ash and his friends as well as N. N and Hiroto didn`t get along too well at first as N didn`t like the fact that Hiroto was placing his Pokémon in danger to save humans. Hiroto pointed out to him though that there are times when Pokémon save humans but there are also times when it`s the other way around and humans save Pokémon. Hiroto further explained to N that its important to not differentiate whether it`s a human or a Pokémon when they are going to a rescue. After spending time with Hiroto`s Pokémon, N could tell that they weren`t being coerced into helping others and that they genuinely wanted to help others. Realizing that, N seemed to respect Hiroto a bit more.\nAfter being trapped in the basement of complex, Hiroto realized that he needed to bring out his Pokémon power more effectively and make use of them in their rescue operations. N and Iris showed him that the more they cooperate, the better their rescues could be. He thanked them for getting rescued and continued the training with his Pokémon.",
