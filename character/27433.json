  "description" : "Chandelure, known as the Luring Pokémon and based on a chandelier, is the evolution of Lampent. It appears as a ghostly chandelier with purple fire burning in the candle-holders in the absence of candles. Chandelure and its evolution family are the only Ghost/Fire type Pokémon. It is said that if you make contact with a Chandelure`s Hitodama your soul will be burned, leaving only a shell of the victim`s body. It can also hypnotize others by swinging its fires.\nGamesRadar named it \"easily one of the coolest new Unova Pokemon both looks-wise and gameplay-wise.\" In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Chandelure was voted as one of the best Pokémon from Black and White. Editor Thomas East stated that there are \"many very strange Pokemon in Black & White [...] but none of them get as much love as Chandelure.\"",
