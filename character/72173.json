  "description" : "Hajime is traveling to study as a Pokémon Trainer. He resides in the Kalos region near Hiyoku City with his parents and brother Ryuji. He encountered Bonnie in the forest with Clemont`s Chespin attempting to battle a Spear and he came to their rescue. His family used to have picnics on a hill near their home but ever since he and his brother each got a Nyasper from their father and evolved them into Nyaonix, the two of them started butting heads. Ryuji wanted to prove that he could of use to his brother and father and vowed to his older brother Hajime that he`d become a stronger Pokémon Trainer than him. His father set a challenge to whoever finds the treasure hidden on their family`s premises would become his heir. After encountering a Bakuong, Ryuji and Hajime worked together to defeat it. It ended up being their father`s, as he wanted his sons to remember the time when they worked together. Their closeness is their family`s treasure and he didn`t want them to ever forget that.",
