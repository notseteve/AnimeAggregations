  "description" : "Cobalion is the leader of the Sacred Swordsman and was one of the Pok√©mon that helped Keldeo learn the true weight of its sword to become part of the Sacred Swordsman. Cobalion pretty strict, but is also very wise and sometimes speaks it in riddles to help his pupils learn on their own.\nWhile attempting to help save Keldeo from Kyruem, it was frozen in ice. It wasn`t until Keldeo returned to face Kyruem again with Ash Ketchum and his friends that it was released from the ice. After Keldeo proved to be worthy to become a Sacred Swordsman, Cobalion got Ash Ketchum and his friends to be witnesses of the oath.",
