  "description" : "Stantler is a Pokémon with large, curved antlers. These antlers change the flow of the air, causing the space around them to act as a distorted reality, and leaving other beings around the Stantler confused and lost in their senses. This allows it to create hallucinations to aid it in battle or allow it to escape. The antlers are considered art in the Pokémon world, causing the Stantler to almost be hunted to extinction as the trading market of the antlers reached very high prices. The orbs on fallen antlers is often grounded up to a powder that helps people sleep. Stantler`s name is derived from stag, meaning a male deer, and antler, referring to the horn-like growths on its head.",
