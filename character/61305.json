  "description" : "Citron is Eureka`s older brother. He met Ash in Niare City and he and his sister were his very first battle opponents in the Kalos region, a battle he won`t forget soon. He`s a great inventor, a gym leader and carries his pride and joy, the \"Eipam Arm\" in his backpack. Eureka is always searching for a future wife for her brother. Since she`s not a Pokémon Trainer, she gets Citron to \"keep\" Pokémon for her. Citron was confirmed to be in the XY anime in Smash #153. His Japanese name is based off of the fragrant citrus fruit with the same name.",
