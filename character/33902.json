  "description" : "Ootori Takao, Kyouya`s father, is the patriarch of the Ootori family. Takao is portrayed as a cold, calculating father. Kyouya tries hard to please him to become heir of the family, despite the fact that his father apparently shows no understanding for his children and has planned out the lives of his sons as his successors already.\nIn the manga, he acknowledges Kyouya as a possible successor despite being the third son. In the anime, he states he has already decided Kyouya would inherit Ootori Medical from him (in the manga, he states it is a possibility), only to have his third son buy it and return it to his control without ever revealing his identity. He wants Kyouya to marry Haruhi in the anime.\nSource: wiki",
