  "description" : "This young woman is a test subject of the Flanagan Institute, a Zeon research organization created to investigate the gifted humans known as \"newtypes.\" While the exploits of pilots like Char and Amuro have led to speculation that they may be newtypes, Lalah`s powers are obvious and undeniable, and accompanied by a profound spiritual awareness. However, despite her gentle nature, Lalah is fiercely loyal to the man who saved her life - Char Aznable, the scheming \"Red Comet.\"",
