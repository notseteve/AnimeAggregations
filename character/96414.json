  "description" : "The 8th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet and was formed some time prior to 745 UC. It played a notable role in the Second Battle of Tiamat under the command of Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch77659 [Fang Tchewling]. The 8th Fleet, under the command Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch775 [Appleton], was part of the great Alliance invasion of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire] in 796 UC.\nOne of the Imperial planets it occupied was the planet Kleingelt. When the Imperial forces counterattacked after Alliance supply lines were cut, the 8th Fleet was engaged in the Battle of Wansteidt by the Mecklinger Fleet under Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch192 [Ernest Mecklinger]. The 8th Fleet managed to disengage and evade pursuit only after suffering 30% casualties, being one of only three fleets that managed to escape to the Amritsar Starzone relatively intact.\nAt the Battle of Amritsar, the 8th Fleet formed the center of the Alliance line. It came under heavy attack by the http://anidb.net/ch96402 [Black Lancers] during the battle, resulting in the destruction of the flagship http://anidb.net/ch82270 [Krishna] along with Appleton, who went down with the ship. The remnants of the 8th Fleet escaped the battle due to the efforts of the http://anidb.net/ch96406 [13th Fleet] under http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. Afterwards, the 8th Fleet was disbanded and its survivors assigned to other Alliance units, notably the Iserlohn Garrison Fleet which became known as the Yang Fleet.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
