  "description" : "Stunky is a purple and beige skunk-like creature with facial features that seem to resemble buttocks, a reference to its odorous nature. Stunky was introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl for the Nintendo DS. It makes a first appearance in \"A Secret Sphere of Influence\" where it is used by Officer Jenny in place of Growlithe. It is exclusive to Pokémon Diamond. Like the skunk, it protects itself by spraying a noxious fluid from its rear. The stench lingers for 24 hours.\nIn the video games, Stunky give out cries that sound like flatulence.",
