  "description" : "Claus Valca`s navigator and vanship mechanic. The moody, outspoken redhead is proud of her lineage as seen in her protectiveness of her vanship (thought to have belonged to their fathers). Unlike Claus, she is relatively reluctant to stay on the Silvana and favours the freedom of the vanship lifestyle. She abhors the use of vanships for military purposes, and deplores Claus` interest in becoming a combat pilot. Along with her friendly nature, she can hold grudges with others. Her feelings for Claus are obviously conflicted. She treats Claus mostly like a dear friend and sibling, sometimes acts the part of nagging but caring wife, insofar as she cooks for him and rustles him out of bed.",
