  "description" : "Saigou is a large, muscular young man who attends the same school as Koushi and the rest of the main cast. He has a very threatening demeanor, communicating mostly in grunts and gestures and continuously wears sunglasses. He is the admired leader of a trio of hoodlums from Koushi`s class and apparently frequently gets into fights. Appearances are deceiving, however; Saigou is quite fond of kittens, of which he has several, and apparently reads romantic stories for enjoyment. When he first meets Alice Uzuki, he defends her against a large group of assassins without any concern for his own safety. Later, he takes a hit from Alice`s guitar string weapon to protect Koushi from harm. He falls deeply in love with Alice and seeks help from Momoko and the other main cast to find a way to deepen their relationship. In the end, he allows Alice to go so she can pursue her dreams and be safe, speaking out loud for the first time to simply wish Alice \"good luck\", rather than demanding she stay for his sake. Saigou seems to be very friendly to the main casts, especially Koushi, as shown at the ending credits of the last episode, the three hoodlums came with Saigou to threaten Koushi but the three hoodlums flinched when Koushi greeted and waved his hand at Saigou and Saigou waved back.",
