  "description" : "The reincarnation of Suzaku the Vermilion Bird of the South (Summer). He is the most feminine in appearance, behavior (though not as extreme enough to be considered homosexual, which he himself states).\nIn Tenshi no Shippo: He first appears to hypnotize Gorou while on a date with Tsubasa to a theme park to ride the ferris wheel, knowing full well of Tsubasa`s fear of heights. He later takes Tsubasa as his bride, since both are birds. When she later regains control of her will, she slaps Rei, without a care of who he was, to prove a point of how much grief and trouble they caused. Later on, even he notes that Tsubasa has feelings for him, but as he was leaving, he was contented with the result. Unlike his Saint Beast counterpart, his hair covers his left eye, hence the bishounen appearance. Sacred Power: Wings of the Red Phoenix. Talon Strike. Scorched Flame.\nIn Saint Beast: Zeus gave him the Spear of Suzaku. He has an affinity for birds of any sort, including chickens. Ray gained the ability to fly after he became an adult angel; his wings are gold in color. He is very close to Houou no Luka. He is also disgusted at humans because they eat fried chicken which happens to be Gai`s favorite food. Very good at cooking.\nAttribute: Water\nAbility: Manipulating minds\nAttack: Ice Blade\nImage Color: Red",
