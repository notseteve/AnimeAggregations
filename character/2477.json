  "description" : "The Apsalus III is the end result of Ginias Saharin`s top-secret weapon development project, a huge, non-humanoid \"mobile armour\" armed with an incredibly powerful mega particle cannon. Like the previous prototype versions of the Apsalus, it`s equipped with a lift-generating \"Minovsky craft\" system which allows it to fly at high speeds, ascend into space, and re-enter Earth`s atmosphere directly over its chosen target. If Ginias is able to complete the Apsalus project, no Federation base - not even the underground fortress of Jaburo - will be safe.",
