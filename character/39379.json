  "description" : "He`s a Lieutenant in the Zaiglian Space Force, a man in search of the truth; and to that end, he`s decided to blend in with the people of Earth. Just like other Zaiglians, he`s very pokerfaced... But at the same time, he`s also calm and collected, as any good Lieutenant should be. Though he`s not much of a talker, he`s always ready and willing to adapt to new situations.\nSource: shingu.rightstuf.com",
