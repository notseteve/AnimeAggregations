  "description" : "Tokima is the demon who originally bridged the dimensional gaps between the demon plane and the human plane. He is very powerful, with the ability to control both the time and space continuums. He has fought and lost to every previous generation of Mamono Hunter, which explains the 107 scars on his body. After each such loss some of his power was sealed away by that particular Mamono Hunter.",
