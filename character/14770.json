She enjoys teasing Chocolat, Duke, and almost anyone who annoys her. She also likes tea parties with her mice friends. Chocolat calls her \"Rat\". Even though she has a very bitter relationship with Chocolat, there are times when she can show her soft side towards the girl.\nIn the manga she ran a salon in the Magical World, but was turned into a familiar when she fell in love with a human and lost her heart. She is turned back into her original form with the power of Pierre`s (now white) heart.\nHer name in Spanish means white (feminine form of blanco).",
