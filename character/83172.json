  "description" : "Amamiya Ren is the protagonist of the story. Originally coming from an unspecified small town, after intervening in a street altercation between a drunk man (who turns out to be the powerful politician Shidou Masayoshi) and a woman, he is convicted of assault, expelled from his former school, and sentenced to one year of probation. He is ordered by the court to transfer schools, with Shuujin Academy in Tokyo being the only one that would accept him with his criminal record. He is made to stay with Sakura Soujirou, who begrudgingly gives him a place to stay as a favour for Ren`s parents, who are acquaintances. As he serves out his sentence of probation, he begins to awaken to strange powers that might enable him to avert the coming ruin that is about to fall upon the world.",
