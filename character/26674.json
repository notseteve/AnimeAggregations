  "description" : "Kaburagi T. Kotetsu is one of the protagonist of the series \"Tiger & Bunny\" and the one behind the guise of the Hero Wild Tiger. As a NEXT he possesses Hundred Power, a power that, once activated, increases his physical abilities by 100 times for five minutes. Kotetsu is driven by a strong sense of justice and he has a firm belief in his self-image as a Hero; thus, he keeps his real identity a secret. He does not care about racking up points to increase his rank at Hero TV, and instead he attempts his best to save civilians and bring criminals to justice. Kotetsu is incredibly reckless, which often leads him to cause propriety damage, a habit that awarded his Hero persona the nickname \"The Crusher of Justice\". In spite of being depicted as silly and clumsy, Kotetsu can be passionate and serious, especially if to preserve the well-being of those around him.",
