  "description" : "Mai is a student at the Santa Claus Academy who has problems using her magic. She can only conjure up things that start with \"san\" (サン) in the Japanese language. She was sent to San-chan to cheer him up as her mission, but eventually falls in love with him in the process. Mai first appears to San-chan as a junior high school student. Later when San-chan starts to believe in Santa Claus, Mai gains enough Christmas powers to change into her grown up form. In adult form, Mai oddly enough uses the hyper-masculine \"Ore\" (as opposed to the traditionally feminine \"atashi\") when referring to herself, despite the feminine appeal that she gains with her transformation.",
