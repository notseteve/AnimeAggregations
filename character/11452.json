  "description" : "Laertes Montague is the ruthless, Machiavellian Duke of Neo Verona. He, an illegitimate Capulet offspring, and his mother (a prostitute) was born and raised into poverty. The death of his mother sparks his unrelenting and ferocious grudge against the Capulet name and his ambitions for being Duke. He acts coldly to all around him, only seeming to care about the Great Tree Escalus. His main goal in the series is to find Lord Capulet`s surviving child and kill her before the people still loyal to the Capulets can rebel. He is killed late in the series by a mad Mercutio, moments before surrendering to Juliet.",
