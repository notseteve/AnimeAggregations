  "description" : "Yoshimi is Kaoru`s gravure idol elder sister that is about Minamoto`s age. Given the prominent cleavage that both she and Akie have, it can be argued that the origins of Kaoru`s lesbian lechery lie here. As pointed out by Akie, a gravure idol appears to be a sort of trainee-entertainer designation. Considering the 11-year difference in age, Yoshimi is probably not really affected that much by her parents` divorce and just has no clue how to help Kaoru. Like with Akie, she deals with this with her work and dating.",
