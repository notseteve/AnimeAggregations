  "description" : "Kamiki Noike Jurai, or Noike Sakatsu, is the adopted daughter of Kamiki Seto Jurai. She was abandoned by her mother after her mother`s fiance decided that a child would be too much of a bother for them. She spent her childhood in an orphanage, and at some point, ended up in the GP Academy. Not to long after becoming a \"1st class detective\", Noike would meet with Mikami Kuramitsu, the principal of GP Academy. This meeting was arranged so that Noike might meet with Seto Kamiki Jurai, who would immediately go on to adopt her, bond her with a third-generation tree, and inadvertently introduce her to her new older sister, Misaki Kamiki Jurai.\nIn the past she was a partner to Mihoshi Kuramitsu. Later on, she had been introduced as a fiancé to Tenchi Masaki. Naturally, Ryoko and Ayeka were not happy about the whole situation. Later, she revealed to Ryoko and Ayeka that her role as Tenchi`s fiancé was in fact a ruse; she was actually keeping an eye on Tenchi and his household, which—containing Ryoko, Washu, two princesses of Jurai, and Tenchi himself—is perhaps the largest concentration of power in the universe, but she did fall in love with Tenchi.\nSource: Wikipedia",
