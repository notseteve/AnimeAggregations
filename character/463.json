  "description" : "Dratini is a serpent-like dragon Pokémon with a white circle shape on its forehead. It has two developing wings at the sides of its head, which grow to be enormous as it evolves. Dratini are born small, and as they shed their skin, they grow larger. They have a massive amount of energy rapidly increasing inside of their bodies, hence, they have great strength which grows exponentially as they evolve. They were thought to be purely mythical creatures, but they were discovered to be real by a fisherman. They live in colonies in the ocean in limited numbers and fetch a high price as Pokémon to be used for battling. They can only be obtained by the most determined and skilled trainers, as demonstrated on various episodes of the original Pokémon series.\nThe episode in which Dratini first appeared (\"The Legend of Dratini\") has never been seen on American television, due to use of guns and humor considered \"politically incorrect\" to American audiences (Meowth dressed as Adolf Hitler, Jessie seducing a guard by dressing up as a schoolgirl).",
