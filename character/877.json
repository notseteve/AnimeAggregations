  "description" : "Combusken is the evolved form of Torchic. Combusken`s legs are both fast and powerful, and to keep them at peak physical condition, many run through nearby fields and mountains to stay agile and strong. By doing this, Combusken can kick up to 10 times per second, not giving up easily. Like Torchic, Combusken has a place within its body that stores and produces incredibly hot flames, It allows it to spew flames from its beak and to kick continuously until an opponent either faints or gives up.\nIn the anime, May owned a Combusken that evolved from her Torchic to protect Ash`s Corphish, and it later evolved into a Blaziken.",
