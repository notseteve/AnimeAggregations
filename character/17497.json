  "description" : "She is one of \"The Class\", the group of people who live on the Hill. This first-rate expert in texhnolyzation came to the city of Lukuss to advance her studies. More of a scientist than a doctor, she sees texhnolyzation as a means of human evolution rather than medical treatment. Her display of strong possessiveness toward Ichise, such as desperately trying to find him after he runs away from the lab, indicates that Ichise is a vital test subject in her experiments. Despite her general cleverness, she occasionally shows a nervous, childish side.",
