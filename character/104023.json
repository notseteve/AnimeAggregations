  "description" : "Tamayo is a talented doctor who is also a demon. She was converted into a demon by http://anidb.net/ch104020 [Muzan], which resulted in her killing and eating her family to her horror. She grew to despise Muzan and eventually managed to alter her cells to separate herself from him. She further altered herself to allow her to survive on a small amount of blood and no flesh. She is attempting to find a cure for demons, but requires the blood of special demons. To this end, she enlists help from http://anidb.net/ch99458 [Tanjirou], who offers some of http://anidb.net/ch99459 [Nezuko]`s blood as well as trying to get the blood from a Demon Moon. She can also create demons—the only other demon beside Muzan who can—but she insists on only doing it for dying patients who have no other option and ensures they know the price of becoming a demon.\nSource: Wikipedia",
