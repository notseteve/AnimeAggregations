  "description" : "A teacher in charge of student life, he sustains an impassive expression when dealing with pupils and tries to enforce his authority over Ishiyama students, first by threatening to expel Kunieda and Oga if they do not restrain their colleagues; later, by deciding on the expulsion of Oga, all the Touhoushinki, Furuichi and Natsume. However, he is outmaneuvered by Himekawa and ends up agreeing to the condition of removing the Horsemen`s authority in case Ishiyama win the volleyball match, which they do. During Kiriya and Teimou`s plot, he keeps his cool and even threatens expulsion in case either of the opposing sides resorts to violence.",
