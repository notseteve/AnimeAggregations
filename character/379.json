  "description" : "Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\nIt evolves from Koffing starting at level 35.\nIn Galar, Weezing has a Poison/Fairy-type regional form. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.\nWeezing is a purple Pokémon consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have differing sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short timespan because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.\nEach of Weezing`s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing`s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.\nWeezing lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing`s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantoian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.\nIn the Galar region, its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a grey body with with the skull, crossbones, and ring changed to color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly release purified air. Five green puffs of poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The larger head has a cloud-like mustache, while the smaller has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.\nGalrian Weezing consumes particles from the polluted air. It expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Weezing`s body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leaks and drifts around it. The gas is Weezing`s best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.\nGalarian Weezing is the only known Pokémon capable of using the the move Strange Steam.",
