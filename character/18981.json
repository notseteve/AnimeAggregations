  "description" : "A famed motorcycle racer with white hair. Due to a Demoniac attack, he was rendered paralysed from the waist down, an event which ended his career as a champion and alienated him from both his team and girlfriend. On the brink of despair he was approached by Beatrice and offered the chance to restore his lost legs, becoming a Demoniac in the process. Initially working the same way as Joseph and hunting down Amalgams he was hailed as a hero and a saviour, but after discovering that his former team manager and his girlfriend had been plotting behind his back, he tried to kill them in a murderous rage and was branded as a monster. With only Hermann and Malek supporting him, he quickly succumbed to his powers and began to see everyone around him as another Amalgam. He fought fiercely with Joseph several times, and during one of these fights, regained his sanity long enough to ask Joseph to kill him if he lost control again, as he had just recently slaughtered his Amalgam-turned girlfriend on broad daylight. When he does lose control again during a race with his friend Hermann Saltza, he manages one last feat of will and drops his guard to allow Joseph to kill him, ending his tormented existence. Later on in the series, both he and Hermann are seen resting together in purgatory.\nAs a Demoniac, Gerd was exceptionally well-versed in melee combat, fighting with a pair of energy-bladed boomerangs attached to his back or protruding sharp energy blades from his feet, knees or elbows. His armoured form was mostly white, with his helmet being purplish-red.",
