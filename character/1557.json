  "description" : "Masa is a member of the Seto Group. He has an afro and always wearing sunglasses. Masa is the one who, through performing CPR, \"stole\" Nagasumi`s first kiss. He also transfers to Nagasumi`s school, becoming his math teacher (whose word problems tend to describe to the mathematical aspects of underworld gang operations). There is a running gag of Nagasumi displaying an attraction towards Masa since their `first kiss` in the first episode. Masa is the only one apart from Sun`s mother who doesn`t object to the engagement and sometimes even gives advice to Nagasumi. Usually he is portrayed a silent man. However, when he drinks he tends to talk too much and reminisce. He is later revealed later in the series to be the long-lost brother of Shiranui Akeno.",
