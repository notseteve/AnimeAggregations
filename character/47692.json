  "description" : "Sakaki Haruto is an 18-year-old Hunter. Haruto is supportive, but brash, slightly hot-tempered, and ambitious, often rushing into danger during hunts, producing regrettable results. He is the STN-J`s newest member, after Robin, and is initially afraid of being replaced when she arrives. Despite this, he welcomes her. Although his exact condition is unknown, it is suggested he is an unawakened seed when he is hunted by Zaizen. At the series` conclusion, Sakaki is confirmed to be alive and still hunting witches.\nSource: Wikipedia",
