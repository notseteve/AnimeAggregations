  "description" : "While in an fighter configuration, Kyrios duals as a jet fighter/bomber. During missions that requires fast hit-and-run tactics the tail unit can fire missiles to either destroy incoming aerial units or specific ground targets. It also carries bombs within the \"underbelly\" of the tail unit. Because of Kyrios` GN Drives, the fighter is capable of carrying weight that no mobile suit can transport. Thus the tail unit can only be utilized by Kyrios. Without the \"tail unit\" and its weapon compliments, Kyrios resorts to dog fighting, using its GN Submachine Gun.",
