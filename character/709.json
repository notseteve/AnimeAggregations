In the game, the magical sakura tree granted her wish, and she possessed Yoriko`s body, which transformed into a copy of her original body, but with cat ears. In the anime, Yoriko jumps out of Misaki`s window to see the world in her place, and was transformed into a maid resembling Misaki with cat ears. Yoriko has a fear of people after an incident with some children, and her events detail her settling in as a maid as well as slowly venturing into the outside world.",
