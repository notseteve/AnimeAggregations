  "description" : "Kawamura is a soft-spoken person off the court, very gentle and shy, though still outspoken and stubborn when he takes a decision. However, he becomes extremely aggressive and loud once he grabs his racket, or any racket. This change in his personality is marked by him shouting \"Burning!!!\" \"Great!!!\" \"Baby!\" His personality along with these keywords when he holds a racket is most likely just for comic relief, but his personality change does have a large impact on his skills, becoming the powerhouse of Seigaku. Son of a sushi chef, he works hard in order to take over his family`s sushi restaurant.",
