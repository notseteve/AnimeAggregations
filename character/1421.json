  "description" : "Hakuoro wears an irremovable mask over the top part of his head extended down to just under the eyes. He is found badly injured by Eruruu, Aruruu and their grandmother in a nearby forest and nursed back to health by them. Also, he has lost all his memories and in effect, has no idea who he is and is somewhat confused at the bizarre nature of the world he is now living in. He is given the name Hakuoro (also the name of Eruruu and Aruruu`s father) due to his being unable to remember his original name. His main weapon of choice is a large metal fan that was given to him by Tusukuru. Hakuoro (白皇) means \"White Emperor\" in Ainu.",
