  "description" : "Utau`s second Guardian Character and is the complete angelic opposite of Il. El often nags, likes correcting people about their choices that she considers wrong herself and help those who are troubled by love. Because El was treated badly by Il and ignored by Utau, she left home and wound up in Amu`s care. El can perform a Character Transformation with Amu, resulting in Amulet Angel, which surprised Utau. However, as Amu is not El`s real owner, the Character Transformation remains powerless with no real abilities. Whenever El performs a Character Transformation with Amu, Amu usually ends up being embarrassed due to El`s over-the-top antics. El finally performed a Character Transformation with Utau, forming Seraphic Charm.",
