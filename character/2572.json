  "description" : "He holds allegiance to Aion`s Sinners, and is also the Apostle of Hope and Rosette`s little brother. He is able to freeze people`s time with the use of Chrono`s devil horns, given to him by Aion. He was tricked into taking Chrono`s horns and following Aion because he didn`t want Rosette to have to take care of him all the time. He wanted to be strong enough to take care of her and be her support instead of the other way around.\nSource: Wikipedia",
