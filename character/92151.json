  "description" : "Jade Ariel is an Ariel, creature that looks innocent but is quite mischievous. Her kind assists with the power of wind, an element best for purification and guiding. It tried to lure http://anidb.net/ch80778 [Chise] away from http://anidb.net/ch80775 [Elias] to Faerie Kingdom, but failed in doing so as she was already devoted to Elias because he was the first one to call her family. Later on, it helped Chise with her first cleansing.\nSource: Mahou Tsukai no Yome Wiki, edited.",
