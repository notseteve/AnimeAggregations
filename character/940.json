  "description" : "Nincada is an insectoid species of Pokémon found in the Hoenn region. It burrows underground and lives for years by feeding on tree roots, hiding motionlessly under the soil. Using its whiskerlike antennae, it feels its way to tree roots, which it slices open with its claws to feed. As a burrower, it`s nearly blind until it evolves, and it doesn`t even like being exposed to light.\nMuch like the cicada, it metamorphoses into a flying adult form through Pokémon evolution called Ninjask, and it leaves a distinctive husk behind. Unlike the mundane cicada`s husk, however, Nincada`s husk itself becomes a separate, sentient Pokémon species known as Shedinja. This is the only instance in Pokémon media where an individual Pokémon`s evolutionary process results in the creation of two individual Pokémon, and in the Pokémon RPGs when a Pokémon trainer-owned Nincada evolves into a Ninjask, a Shedinja will appear in an empty slot in the trainer`s Pokémon inventory.",
