  "description" : "Unlike Elpeo Ple, who was kind and very spirited, Ple Two is very aggressive, showing anger and coldness to everyone around her, save for Glemy Toto. But she has shown an ability to care for others, choosing not to kill certain people she had come across. While a seemingly perfect killer and always obeying Glemy`s orders without question, she does defect and the pressure she gains when fighting other Newtypes does cause massive amounts of pain to her at times, such as Judau. It is possible she is a bit mentally unstable.\nSource: gundam.wikia.com",
