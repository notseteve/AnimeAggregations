Aleksandra is based on ace http://anidb.net/ch85335 [Alexander Ivanovich Pokryshkin], second best ace of USSR and anti-Hitler coalition during WWII.\nNote: Due to how family names in Russian change based on the person`s gender, her official name is actually spelled wrong; the form in proper Russian would be Aleksandra Ivanovna Pokryshkina instead.",
