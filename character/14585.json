  "description" : "Yamazaki Takashi is a student in Sakura`s class, and the only male student in the class to be referred to by name before the introduction of Syaoran. Throughout the series, Yamazaki`s defining trait is his ability to fabricate highly detailed fake stories and histories about practically any subject. While most of his classmates see through these fabrications, Sakura and Syaoran often believe them. When the character Eriol is introduced in the second half of the series, he becomes Yamazaki`s storytelling ally. The two are able to respond to one another`s clues perfectly and spin complex stories on the fly.\nFellow classmate Chiharu often interrupts his stories so others know when he is lying, and proceeds to punish him for lying by pretending to strangle him or by dragging him away by his collar. While the two often seem to be arguing, they are actually a couple and have known one another since kindergarten. She is the only girl in the series that he addresses by her first name.\nYamazaki is the only character to be rarely shown with his eyes open. On the day of Judgement when Sakura is shown a world in which everyone losing their feelings for the person they love the most, Yamazaki and Chiharu lose their feelings for each other and are shown to be strangers.",
