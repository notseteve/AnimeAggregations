  "description" : "Ishikawa formerly served with http://anidb.net/ch1582 [Kusanagi] and http://anidb.net/ch1584 [Batou] in South America when they were with the Ground Self-Defense Forces in the Japanese UN contingent. He was one of the earliest members recruited to be in http://anidb.net/ch1590 [Section 9] and seems to know the Major and her dislikes quite well. He is shown as being in charge of a pachinko parlor called Parlor Ishikawa, and on occasion uses the cyberbrains of the old men who play there to complete particularly heavy data gathering, though it seems the men suffer no ill effects or are even aware of their situation. Ishikawa is the most seemingly laid-back member of the unit.",
