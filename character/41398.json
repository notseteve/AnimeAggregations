In fact, the friendship between Jun`ichi, Sentarou, and http://anidb.net/ch41400 [Ritsuko] goes way back to when they were kids. \"Brother Jun\" goes to college in Tokyo now, but whenever he comes home, he always stops in at Welcome Records and jams on the trumpet, playing jazz with Sentarou and whoever else is around.\nSource: Official Site",
