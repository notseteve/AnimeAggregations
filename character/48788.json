  "description" : "A variant to the standard VF-1 Valkyrie, the variable fighter \"D\" is a two-seater version that features two TV camera \"eye\" systems within the head unit and slightly upgraded firepower via a second Mauler RÃ–V-20 anti-aircraft laser cannon. Manufactured by the VF-1 designer Stonewell and Bellcom, the VF-1D ironically saw the fewest compliment of the main four VF-1 variants aboard the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SDF-1 Macross], but nonetheless was an active-service variable fighter. A number of VF-1D units were also deployed as advanced training variable fighters, for live weapons and full combat functionality instruction. A VF-1D unit designated VT-102 was one such example with the label \"Stud Seat\" (Student) and \"INST CAPT. DAGGER\" (Instructor) found upon the exterior of the cockpit (this was the same variable fighter flown by then civilian pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] in February 2009).\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/vf-1d-valkyrie.htm",
