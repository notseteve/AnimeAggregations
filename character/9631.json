  "description" : "Elsa de Sica was another girl whose origins are unclear. She did not wish to associate with anyone except her handler, Lauro, with whom she was deeply in love. Elsa`s attitude towards others, even among the other girls, could be described as aloof and impersonal. She would live, and die, only for Lauro.\nElsa`s preferred weapons were the SIG 550, SIG 551, and SIG P229. At the time of her first appearance, Elsa was the newest addition to the Agency.",
