  "description" : "Yukari was Yuuji`s classmate. She has dark-colorred hair which has two small ponytails tied up from it. She has a very upbeat personality, and is kind and quick to help others out, but is very melancholy and silent when she is a Torch.\nShana used the remains of Yukari`s existence to shift the perception of other`s identification of Yukari Hirai to herself (others recognize her as Yukari Hirai, as if Shana had been so all along).",
