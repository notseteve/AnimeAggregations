  "description" : "Karen, as one of the two longest-serving members of the 08th MS Team, has little patience for the team`s bumbling newcomers. Cynical and hot-tempered, she`s rumoured to have been the primary cause of her last commander`s nervous breakdown. Still, Karen`s three months of ground-combat experience make her an invaluable asset to the 08th MS Team. And, as a former medical student - and the widow of a military surgeon - Karen can also serve as a field medic in emergencies.",
