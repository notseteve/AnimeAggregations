  "description" : "Shizuku is extremely forgetful and can be an airhead at times which, along with her unassuming appearance, can cause opponents to underestimate her combat abilities. Shizuku uses her Nen vacuum \"Blinky\" (\"Deme-chan\" in the original Japanese version) in combat, which is able to suck up anything that is not nen created or that she considers living. It is also able to regurgitate the last thing sucked up. She is left-handed, and the twelfth strongest physically out of the thirteen members of the Troupe. Shizuku is member number eight, a replacement for the last member since the Troupe came together. Nen type: Conjuration\nSource: Wiki",
