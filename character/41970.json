  "description" : "Bren, http://anidb.net/ch41968 [Chase]`s closest childhood friend, is all smarts with not enough courage. Always trying to prove himself, he often ends up talking too much.\nThe least physically able of the group, Bren is definitely the smartest — at least by the book. In all reality, he`s an \"egghead\" who truthfully wants to be a hero. Although he lacks guts and instinct, Bren`s overwhelming need to fit in allows him to rise above it — surprising friends, foes and even himself.",
