  "description" : "Mudou Sara is the younger sister of http://anidb.net/ch10027 [Mudou Setsuna] and the reincarnation of the soul of the former Great Cherub, Jibril (Gabriel). Jibril was also one of the Four Elemental Angels, the Angel of Water, and she vocally opposed Sevotharte`s violent actions as Prime Minister. To get Jibril out of the way, he paralysed her with a needle and sent her soul to Earth, so that she could unwittingly serve him as Setsuna`s guardian angel. When Sara dies, her soul is taken up to heaven by Zaphikel to study its unusual spiritual energy signature. Metatron removes Sevy`s needle from the back of Jibril`s neck and Sara`s soul awakens in it. She awakens blind and remains so until she is healed when she uses Jibril`s water powers to help Raphael revive Setsuna. She is in love with Setsuna. Her soul was returned to her original body by Raphael, who claims to love her. This is not true, for through Sara, Raphael was to realise that his true love was someone else close to him. Sara has a pure, innocent heart, but she has a fierce temper and sharp tongue.\nSource: wiki",
