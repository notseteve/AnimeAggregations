  "description" : "When Negi retreats to the woods to gather his thoughts after a shocking confrontation with one of his students, the little magi is surprised to run into yet another of his charges, Kaede Nagase! Exuding a Zen-like calm and a maturity well beyond her years (not just because of her much discussed bust!), Kaede spends her free time training in the forested mountains. Exactly what she is training for, she will not tell. But at least she`s good at keeping information under wraps, because she soon figures out Negi`s magical secret! With Kaede`s wisdom and guidance, Negi may just be able to grasp some hidden truths! Springfield may be the teacher, but Kaede is responsible for the lessons today.",
