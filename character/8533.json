  "description" : "Yukimura Keiko (雪村 螢子) is Yusuke`s childhood friend; nowadays, they are near polar opposites, Keiko being a straight-A student and Yusuke being a juvenile delinquent, but the two are both closer than either like to admit. Keiko`s parents run a ramen restaurant named Yukimura Diner (雪村食堂 Yukimura Shokudou). After Yusuke is killed in a car accident, he is permitted another chance to live should someone, who ends up being Keiko, kiss his corpse. Yusuke tries not to involve her with his spirit detective experiences, though multiple interferences from demons prevent this. After being told an almost unbelievable lie by Botan, Keiko learns the truth when she goes with Botan, Yukina, Shizuru and Atsuko to the Dark Tournament, and continues supporting Yusuke in his further adventures. Towards the end of the series, Yusuke proposes to Keiko, telling her that no matter where life takes them, they will always be together in each others` hearts, even after having to wait three years for him to return to her.\nIn the English FUNimation anime her name is spelled Kayko.",
