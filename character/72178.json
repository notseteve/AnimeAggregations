  "description" : "Hajime and Ryuji`s Father resides in the Kalos region near Hiyoku City with his wife. His family used to have picnics on a hill near their home but ever since he and his brother each got a Nyasper from their father and evolved them into Nyaonix, the two of them started butting heads. Ryuji wanted to prove that he could of use to his brother and father and vowed to his older brother Hajime that he`d become a stronger Pok√©mon Trainer than him. Disappointed that his sons were fighting, he set a challenge that whoever found the treasure hidden on their family`s premises would become his heir. After encountering a Bakuong, Ryuji and Hajime worked together to defeat it. It ended up being their father`s, as he wanted his sons to remember the time when they worked together. Their closeness is their family`s treasure and he didn`t want them to ever forget that.",
