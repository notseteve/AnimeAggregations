  "description" : "Apricot Sakuraba, or Rico for short, is the first member of the Rune Angel Troupe. She also happens to be the younger sister of Moon Angel Troupe ace pilot Milfeulle Sakuraba, whom she loves greatly. Thus, she constantly tries to be just like her as much as possible. While not particularly athletic, Apricot is known for having a superhuman amount of strength, though this only shows itself subconsciously. Despite harbouring a crush on her team leader, she is terrified of boys, and will unintentionally lash out with her full strength should a boy so much as touch her shoulder.\nHer personal colour is orange. In battle, she pilots the new Emblem Frame \"Cross Caliber\", a very small, light Frame that can mode change to attack; its special attack is Hyper Blaster.",
