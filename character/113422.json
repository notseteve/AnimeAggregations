  "description" : "As a pseudo-Apostle, the Imp gained the common feature of enhanced strength, speed, stamina and angelic wings. He also received a higher level of speed than the others because of his short stature. He remained to fight Guts with the others, using his high speed to his advantage, but in the end, he sustained heavy damage from the mini-bombs and was defeated.\nBerserk Wiki",
