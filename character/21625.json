  "description" : "Eucliwood, called `Eu` for short, is a necromancer who brought Ayumu back to life to be her guard and has been living with him since. She doesn`t talk, instead communicating through written notes, mostly pertaining to her appetite. It is shown that she does care about Ayumu even though she considers him to be her servant. She does not like people talking about death or telling them to go die. Ayumu often daydreams about her speaking in a cutesy manner (voiced by a different voice actor in each episode of the anime).",
