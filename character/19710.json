  "description" : "Nue is the Thunder King and a second generation Gravity Child and possibly the son of Black Burn. He leads the team \"Black Crow\", which is made up of twenty other, much younger second generation Gravity Children, who help him create illusions by manipulating the Earth`s magnetic field. He has full body Regalia that manipulates electricity and magnetism, allowing him to create hallucinations and powerful electric attacks with a built-in wire system. Though he respects and occasionally helps Kogarasumaru, he remains with Genesis because Sora has promised to change the world enough to enable the Gravity Children under his care to live a normal life.",
