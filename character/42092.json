  "description" : "Formerly known as Sirzechs Gremory and also known as the \"Crimson Satan\", Sirzechs is the current Satan who received the title \"Lucifer\" and Rias older brother. Sirzechs is the most powerful of the Four Satans and is as powerful as the former Lucifer. However in Volume 8, Ddraig thinks that Sirzechs may be more powerful than the former Lucifer. He is a wizard-technique type where he uses his Power of Destruction to focus only on its target, which requires a high intellect and concentration.\nSource: Wikipedia",
