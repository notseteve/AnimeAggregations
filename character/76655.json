  "description" : "Giolio Comanche, better known as the Silver Alchemist (銀の錬金術師, Shirogane no Renkinjutsushi), is an elderly, diminutive man whose thirst for battle is belied by his grandfatherly countenance. The Silver Alchemist is one of the State Alchemists sent into the Ishval Civil War as part of Order 3066. Notably, Comanche is the only one among them shown smiling when the Order goes into effect. He loses his left leg during the war, resulting in his current peg leg. This does not slow him down, as he has adopted this peg leg to his combat style.",
