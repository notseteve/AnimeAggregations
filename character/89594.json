  "description" : "Aoyama is a first-year and Fujimi High School`s midfielder and has competed in U-16 matches. He is a http://anidb.net/t6992 [clean freak], causing him to play soccer in a unique style, involving being extremely careful of physical contact with other players and the ball. He also insists on cleaning the club room and soccer balls after school.\nHe is popular and often garners many spectators during club activities, which annoys http://anidb.net/ch89595 [Zaizen]. Aoyama chose Fujimi High for the school`s `uniqueness`, which turned out to be that its toilet has a bidet.\nSource: Wikipedia",
