  "description" : "Sunred`s girlfriend. She works at an insurance firm and apparently supports Red financially (who does not seem to have any source of income at all other than pachinko). Based on dialogue, she is not particularly skilled at sewing (Red is apparently much better) and she lacks confidence in her cooking.\nShe appears to be a typical Japanese career woman: serious, polite and hardworking. She is also critical of Red, especially when he begs her for money. Like Red, she is unafraid to speak her mind and knows that deep down he cares for her deeply.\nKayoko gets along very well with General Vamp, and the two often talk. On occasion, she even asks him for advice on housework.",
