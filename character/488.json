  "description" : "Nico Robin, nicknamed \"Demon Child\" (悪魔の子, Akuma no Ko) by the http://anidb.net/ch1974 [World Government] is the 28 years old archeologist of the http://anidb.net/ch1954 [Straw Hat Pirates] Growing up alone on the island Ohara, home of the world`s largest and oldest library, she became an archeologist at age eight and learned how to decipher the writings on the ancient stones called Poneglyph, which are scattered around the world. After the World Government destroyed Ohara for housing archeologists along with her returning mother, http://anidb.net/ch2887 [Nico Olivia], researching these stones, Robin spent twenty years on the run, cooperating with various pirates and other outlaws and became a member of http://anidb.net/ch2939 [Baroque Works] nicknamed as \"Ms. All-Sunday\"; Ms. Sunday (4Kids dub) at the time, being briefly an antagonist to the Straw Hat Pirates before joining them. Like the scholars of Ohara before her, it is her dream to find and decipher the Rio Poneglyph, which is said to tell the world`s lost history. Her devotion to history and its preservation goes so far that she will even risk her life to protect ancient artefacts and buildings. She ate the Flower-Flower Fruit, allowing her to create copies of any of her body parts on any surface that she can see. However, if her replicated parts are hurt, she feels the pain on her actual body.",
