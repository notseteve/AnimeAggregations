  "description" : "Akkie participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament where he was paired up against Ash in the third match of the first round. He used his Yanakkie against Ash`s Scraggy. Freddy introduced Akkie by saying that his \"moves shine like his pompadour\".\nIn the beginning of the match, when ordered to use Leer, Zuruggu mistakenly rushed up to Akkie and used the move on him instead, which provoked a scoffing remark from him about Ash`s Scraggy. Akkie`s Yanakkie proved to be really strong, and even though Zuruggu managed to avoid taking damage from its Seed Bomb, Low Sweep and Shadow Claw moves at first, Yanakkie cleverly managed to cause a lot of damage to it by preventing it from defending itself when it used Low Sweep on Zuruggu after stepping on its foot. Zuruggu, however, was also shown to be a tough opponent for Yanakkie, when it managed to avoid Akkie`s Yanakkie`s Giga Impact attack by using Hi Jump Kick.\nAfter Zuruggu failed to use Hi Jump Kick twice in a row and took heavy damage due to missing its target, Akkie ordered his Yanakkie to use Low Sweep repeatedly on Ash`s Scraggy. Before Yanakkie got the chance to finish off Zuruggu with its Giga Impact attack, though, Zuruggu managed to fight back with focus at Satoshi`s command, learning Focus Blast in the process and stopping Yanakkie in its tracks. In the end, even though the newly-learned move`s accuracy proved to not be all that good, Ash`s Scraggy managed to beat Akkie`s Yanakkie with a Leer and Headbutt combo.\nAkkie was also seen cheering for Bakkie in her battle against Ash along with Chakkie.",
