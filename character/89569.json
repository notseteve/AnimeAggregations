  "description" : "Tobata commands the band of Matsumae Han officials sent to pursue http://anidb.net/ch19135 [Okuru]. Clearly enjoys what he is doing, as evidenced by the smirk on his face when he (thinks he) finally has Okuru cornered. His allegiance is to his daimyo and cannot be swerved, as he declares that he \"has his orders,\" even after hearing that his superiors` motives might be less than honorable. Is stunned that Okuru is still on his feet after having been riddled by flaming arrows. He rushes forward with his katana drawn, intending to put an end to the enemy of the state. A dispassionate Okuru wrenches an arrow out his body and stabs Tobata to death with it.\nSource: Wikipedia",
