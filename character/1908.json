  "description" : "The first hostile Servant to appear in this story, Lancer is a fierce but balanced warrior who enjoys combating a worthy opponent. He has a blunt, playful attitude and takes a very carefree approach to life, but is quick to work himself into a frenzy during a heated battle. While he follows the cruel orders of his Master out of his duty as a Servant, Lancer has more than once ignored and gone against those orders to follow his own beliefs. Lancers are hailed as the \"Most Agile\" of Servant classes.",
