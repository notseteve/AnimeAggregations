  "description" : "In the beginning of the story, she is initially shown as anti-social and displayed various personality quirks, but as the series progressed, she became more open with her emotions, whilst still remaining highly active. She became the founder of, and recruiter for, the SOS Brigade, forcibly enlisting Kyon, Yuki Nagato (the only member of the Literature Club), Mikuru Asahina, and Itsuki Koizumi. She is responsible for organizing most of their activities as a group.\nUnknown to her, she has the power to change, destroy, or create a new reality based on her inner desires and feelings. She is described in various ways; Yuki states that she has `the potential for auto-evolution`, Mikuru believes that she is the originator of a large time-quake and finally Itsuki declares her to be `God`. Due to this, she is the main focus of the Integrated Data Entity, the Organization, and an organization of future humans.",
