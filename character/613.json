  "description" : "Aizawa Sakuya is a cousin of http://anidb.net/ch528 [Nagi] and from Kansai. Like Nagi, Sakuya is very rich and has a similar personality â€” loud, arrogant, abusive of servants, and unwilling to accept defeat in anything. Nagi is one of the only people who can stand up to her, once again showing their similar personalities. Sakuya is the eldest daughter in her family with three sisters and one brother. Her illegitimate half brother http://anidb.net/ch16045 [Gilbert] is one of the people who is constantly harassing Nagi for her fortune. Sakuya is obsessed with stand-up comedy especially Manzai style. She encourages http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate] to become a comedian because she believes Hayate`s life up to now is nothing more than a comedy.",
