  "description" : "Jun is Noe`s older brother. He is the captain of the basketball team at his school and is number four in his team. It is hinted that he might have more feelings for Noe than just a normal sibling`s relationship. He asks Shin`ichirou to ask Noe out, but Shin`ichirou merely gets annoyed at him. However, when Shin`ichirou requests that Jun go out with Hiromi in return for going out with his sister Noe, he agrees immediately. He does not hold any feelings for Hiromi, and is merely acting to make Noe happy.",
