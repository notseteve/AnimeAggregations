  "description" : "Ayane is a close friend of Sawako. She is the arguably the most mature of the group and she has a boyfriend in college. In Kurumi`s fake rumours, it is said that Ayane has played more with more than 100 guys in middle school. In their current high school, it is being said that Yano and Yoshida have pretty much authority in the year group. Perceptive and intelligent, a trait of Ayane`s personality is that she gives just enough information to leave others wondering, thus forcing them to move forward. Although she is usually calm and collected, she is easily infuriated if someone hurts Sawako and does not hesitate to attack the one responsible she believes is responsible (frequently Kazehaya) with kicks and sharp words.",
