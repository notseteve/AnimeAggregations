  "description" : "Natalia was originally a nationally-known psychic that had gained considerable wealth at a very young ageâ€”until she was exposed as a fraud. Her parents, who were the ones who had exploited her, then took off with all the money that she gained and left her in destitute. Hoping to start life again, she went to Mexico, where she started a new cult, which was based upon Chappy, her beloved cat who had died of diabetes.\n(Source: myanimelist.net)",
