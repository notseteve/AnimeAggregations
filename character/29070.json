  "description" : "Sakuragi`s honey; an intelligent man. Kuki is a very competent Honey and at time to time, gives Yuzuru helpful advice. Kuki is amazingly loyal to Sakuragi and vows that he will do anything for his master. He has been Nayuta Sakuragi`s honey since he was in kindergarten, was responsible for getting him to take a nap and not have Nayuta worry about his parents. In that part, that`s when Nayuta finally calms down because he played with Genjou`s hair. So he would tug it a couple times, and it made Genjou really happy to be of service, and to be able to comfort Nayuta in such a simple way, with his hair. He never cuts his long hair as he does not want to cut away the hair that his master (Nayuta) has once touched. And so thus, he is bad at tying his hair, so usually Nayuta ends up tying his hair for him. Whenever Nayuta ties his hair, it`s because it`s the one thing he can do to help his honey, because it`s the one thing Genjou`s bad at. He also has a hair band that Nayuta gave to him a long time ago, and protects it.",
