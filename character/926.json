  "description" : "Pelipper is the larger and stronger evolved form of the Wingull Pokémon species found in the Hoenn region. This uniquely proportioned pelican is usually found by or over oceans or other large bodies of water. It builds its nest on high cliffs facing the sea, and is able to rest on top of waves to regain energy. Pelipper skims the tops of waves while it hunts for its prey, which are typically fish Pokémon. When Pelipper spots its prey, it dips its large beak into the water and scoops it up. It then proceeds to swallow it whole. Pelipper also carries the eggs of its Wingull offspring inside its beak before and after they hatch. This provides the offspring with protection and, after they hatch, nourishment from the hunted food.",
