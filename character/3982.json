  "description" : "The father of Shannon and Raquel and adoptive father of Pacifica. He is a stout, dark-skinned swordsman of seemingly foreign appearance, and quite a bit older than his wife. Despite being described as someone you wouldn`t want to meet on the roads at night, he is a jovial man whose composure is difficult to break. Like Carol, Yuuma has a greater role on the novels.",
