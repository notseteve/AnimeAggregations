  "description" : "Iwato Kasumi is a third year of Eisui Girls` High School, plays the captain position. She`s been known to play defensively and her records shows that she has never dealt into someone`s hand and is only damaged by a tsumo. Related to Komaki, she is the vessel for the last Goddess and her ability is that she can randomly collect one suit and honor tiles for each round. As such, her hands deals with big damages and this playstyle can only be on the attack, conflicting with her usual defensive playstyle. If she uses this ability she cannot return to her regular playing style until she`s been purified so she`s always careful when using this ability. She is considered by Suehara as the most dangerous player in Eisui.\nSource: Wiki",
