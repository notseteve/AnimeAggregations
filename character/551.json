  "description" : "Crobat is the evolution of Golbat as of the Gold and Silver editions of the game. It`s a purple bat with four wings, with two main wings above and two secondary wings below. The development of these lower wings to replace its legs, as a result of its pursuit of faster, yet more silent flight, enables it to fly fast and silently indeed, but also makes it tough to stop and rest. Its extra wings will even allow it to fly long distances by alternating which set of wings it uses when it tires. The only way it can rest is to hang on a tree branch using its lower legs to grab onto it the way normal bats would. It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby. It uses this to its advantage when hunting prey.\nThe appearances of Crobat in the anime have been largely of Brock`s Crobat. Brock caught a Zubat very early on in the original series, and it evolved into a Golbat, and then a Crobat.",
