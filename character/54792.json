  "description" : "Full Name: Medina La Lugensius Electra\nElectra is an orphan since the destruction of her hometown, after which she is saved by captain Nemo and she is the First Officer of the `Nautilus`, fighting Gargoyle and the Neo-Atlanteans. Electra is deeply in love with Nemo, although she also burgeons a deep grudge toward him for the deaths of her family. Even so, she becomes extremely envious of Grandis` mad infatuation for the Captain, igniting a heated rivalry for his love. She grows fond of Jean and his determination to learn about technology, seeing him as the equivalent of her long lost brother. Nadia, on the other hand, detests Electra and becomes increasingly (and irrationally) jealous of Jean`s friendship with the First Officer (her inability to express her concern to Jean nearly ruins their own relationship); likewise, Electra fears that Nadia will somehow steal Nemo`s heart away from her. Eventually, however, both open up to each other.\nIn the end of the series, Electra is revealed to be pregnant with Nemo`s child, and Marie tells in the epilogue that she gave birth to him and raised him with love, like Nemo asked her.",
