He adopted an orphan Albafica when the latter was a baby, cared for him and trained him in the ways of the Saints. Wanting Albafica to become the next Pisces Gold Saint after his death, he performed a ritual along with his disciple, consisting on exchanging blood to see who has the most poisonous one. Albafica`s deadly poison blood proves too much for Lugonis, and he dies entrusting his pupil the Pisces Gold Cloth and his position as a Saint.",
