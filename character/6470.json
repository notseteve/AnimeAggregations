  "description" : "Nicknamed Isako, which is another reading of 勇子 meaning \"brave girl\", Amasawa Yuuko is a powerful type of hacker known as an \"encoder\" (暗号屋) who is able to manipulate the electronic infrastructure through sophisticated chalk patterns. Rumored to have familial ties to an AR technology company, Isako uses a Brain-Computer Interface to interact with the virtual world — a function hidden inside the hardware of AR visors and eyeglasses. Isako is, on the surface, extremely arrogant and asocial, perceiving human relationships strictly as hierarchies of power and manipulation.\nIsako relentlessly chases special illegals in order to collect kirabugs. She is secretly driven to this task in the hopes of finding her brother in \"the other side\".",
