  "description" : "Lucian is a member of the Sinnoh Elite Four. Lucian made his anime debut with his Girafarig on television using his Girafarig against a Trainer`s Scizor. Then he appeared at the same Pok√©mon Center that Ash, Brock and Dawn were at and was challenged to a battle by Dawn`s Buizel. Buizel quickly lost, due to it not obeying Dawn`s commands.\nWhen Buizel was caged by Team Rocket, he helped it regain its confidence and it broke the cage. He then battled Team Rocket using Buizel for a brief moment. Lucian won the battle with Buizel and realizes it wants a rematch. This time, with Buizel listening to Dawn`s orders, Lucian interrupts the battle and says it`s better this time.",
