  "description" : "Arua is a six year old boy when he debuted in the story, with black hair and black eyes, Arua is an Alpha Stigma bearer from Runa Empire. Runa, a religious empire, branded him as a monster, and captured him for experimentation. He witnessed his parents being killed in front of his own eyes, and almost went berserk if not for Ryner. After being saved by Ryner and Ferris, he learned magic from Ryner and trained his physical body under the tutelage of Ferris, all this to save Kuku from the Orla siblings. Thus he sees himself as their disciple. Ryner remarked that even the most talented magic user would require at least a year before he is able to see the particles of light that are used for magic. But for an Alpha Stigma bearer, this becomes an inborn ability, thus enabling Arua to start learning spells immediately.\nAfter saving Kuku, together with Kuku and Iris, he defected to Roland and lived in the Eris mansion. Later, after Ryner and Ferris escaped, together with Kuku and Iris, he joined up with Ryner`s company. When Ryner and Ferris were blitzing Roland`s camp, Arua assisted them and displayed his ingenuity by blending in Roland`s magic with Nelpha magic to launch a surprise ranged magical attack. In the Legend of the Great Lengendary Heroes, there was an inconsistency in plot in which Arua was said to be from Nelpha.",
