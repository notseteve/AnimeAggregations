  "description" : "CH Postal Company is the company founded by http://anidb.net/ch90199 [Claudia Hodgins], who also acts as its current president.\nIt was founded after the war due to increasing number of people who wanted to send letters but didn`t know how to write or otherwise weren`t able to. Since the government`s postal service didn`t address the civilians` needs, Hodgins thought it would be a great opportunity to create such company. Shortly after, company had plenty of employees and became well-known around the country.",
