  "description" : "Fressange is the researcher who helped design the Nadesico`s propulsion systems based upon an ancient design that had been uncovered on Mars. She is picked up on Mars several years later (after the Jovians conquer) by the Nadesico. She becomes a resident expert and also commissions the \"Naze Nani Nadesico\" segments. In the end, she is instrumental to solving Boson Jumping.\nNevertheless, her past is a mystery until the end when we find out that she was \"Ai\", the little girl who Akito Tenkawa was trying to help back on Mars when the Jovians began their attack before he (and she) Boson Jumped because of his Chulip crystal. However, since Akito was jumping from Mars to the Earth, and Ai had never been to Earth, she got lost and was sent back to the time of the ancient Martian civilization. There, the ancients gave Ai a plate to give to her older self and sent her to the polar ruins so that she would have a chance to see Akito again. Unfortunately, Akito wasn`t able to get to her in time and she boson jumped again, this time to the Martian Desert approximately 20 years before the series begins. She did, however, allow her older self the chance to remember her past fully.",
