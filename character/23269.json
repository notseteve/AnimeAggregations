  "description" : "First year student in Tokyo Denki University. Pro-active otaku, who`s got a thing for both 2-D and 3-D girls. Talks quite a lot, and uses @ch (a spinoff of 2ch) terminology. Plenty of statements he makes could be taken as sexual harassment. He and Rintarou have known each other since high school. Usually turns down Rintarou`s ridiculous requests as \"annoying\", but in truth gets them done in proper order. However, he trusts Rintarou as a friend. Has great confidence in his programming and hacking abilities (he doesn`t mind being called a Super Hacker, but doesn`t like it when people call him Super Haker). He`s always in front of the computer.\nHas the nickname \"Daru\" (ダル), abbreviated after his name.",
