She has poor common sense, which is demonstrated when she stripped in front of others without thinking about it, a result of her years being a researcher. In the To Aru Kagaku no Railgun side story, she is revealed to be the creator of the Level Upper, which functions as a network to connect the minds of psychics who use it. This is also revealed to be the source of her powers, because as the administrator of the Level Upper, she is able to access and control the powers of all the psychics linked to the network.",
