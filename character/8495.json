  "description" : "The weapons and capabilities of Throne Eins have a strong resemblance to that of Gundam Dynames. Throne Eins primarily uses rapid firing to engage enemy units. Eins would often fire the GN Rifle for short-to-mid range attacks and firing the GN Launcher for mid-to-long range attacks. While similar to Dynames, a long range tactical mobile suit, the isn`t considered a sniper. Eins most powerful feature is the GN Mega Launcher, it has high GN particle requirement(s). Since Eins doesn`t have unlimited supply of GN particles, Eins is largely dependent to Throne Drei for transferring compressed GN particles for its most devastating attack. Similar to Virtue`s GN Bazooka, the GN Mega Launcher fires high yield destructive beam; the beam is a narrow beam for high precision destruction. While using the GN Mega Launcher, Eins`s GN Rifle is linked with the GN Mega Launcher and Throne Drei, this is an exposed weakness in between charge and firing should the Thrones encounter formidable resistance.",
