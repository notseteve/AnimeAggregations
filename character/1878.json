  "description" : "Oryou is Mion and Shion`s grandmother and head of the Sonozaki household. She appears to be a very harsh old woman and is considered the most powerful person in Hinamizawa. Both Mion and Shion call her `Oni-baba`, meaning `demon granny`. Although she appears to be somewhat of a tyrant, she occasionally shows her softer side such as agreeing to help Satoko when Keiichi stood up to her and is only harsh to keep appearances. She respects him after this and later described him as an interesting young man in Minagoroshi-hen (but warns him that he will be chased around with a sword if he shows up again).\nShion suspects that she was the mastermind in Satoshi`s disappearance, and accidentally kills her while attempting to interrogate her in Watanagashi-hen and Meakashi-hen.",
