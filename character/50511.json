  "description" : "The Octos is a variable amphibious destroid designed and built by the Anti-United Nations forces to fight in the U.N. Wars. The Octos is capable of functioning in two mode; one, a submarine for operations at sea and a second ground combat quadruped mode which allows the Octos to operate on land. The Octos was built with numerous weapon systems which allowed the robot to fight effectively in a variety of environments and against any kind of adversary from enemy ground and air vehicles to enemy infantry. Like the http://anidb.net/ch50501 [Cheyenne Destroid] of the U.N. Forces, the Octos was also equipped with wheels for much more rapid mobility on land. Production costs for the Octos were high and thus only a small number were manufactured. Even with some failures, the Octos earned a reputation as a sturdy unit in combat. The first roll-out of the Octos happened in 2006 and by the end of the U.N. Wars, 92 Octos machines had been produced. The U.N. Forces continued production of the Octos, producing some 28 units until Space War I when the production line was destroyed.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/octos.htm",
