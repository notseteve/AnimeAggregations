  "description" : "Minami Chiaki is the youngest sister in elementary school. She is in class 5-2 (a reference to http://anidb.net/a4241 [Kyou no Go no Ni]). Her apparent high intelligence often makes her over analyze simple stuff. She also tends to ignore idiotic behavior displayed by http://anidb.net/ch1159 [Kana] and http://anidb.net/ch3106 [Makoto]. She also places http://anidb.net/ch31 [Haruka] in high regards; she respects and looks up to Haruka. Although being the youngest, she is the meanest out of the three; most of the time, she is quiet during group activities, and almost always uses the word \"bakayarou\" (meaning dumbass in or simply you fool in Japanese), which is a more forceful form for \"idiot\" in Japanese (\"baka\" being the less forceful term). Chiaki seems to know that http://anidb.net/ch3101 [Fujioka] is genuinely in love with Kana. \"Chiaki\" contains the kanji for \"autumn\".",
