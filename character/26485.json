  "description" : "Deshiko is a red-haired member of the PSC who ends her sentences with deshi and is always seen with a bou across her shoulders. She appears as a generic member in the manga, but her role is expanded in the anime and in the second season, she becomes the first girl on campus to fall under Kou (as Koutarou)`s hypnosis. Her true monster form pays homage to Lei-Lei of Darkstalkers, as Capcom is one of the anime`s sponsors.",
