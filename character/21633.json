  "description" : "At 18-years old, Ryuusei Date is an extremely hot-blooded young individual. A mecha otaku, Ryuusei is heavily into mobile machines, specifically those of the super robot type. When he receives his R-1, he was disappointed at the fact that it was a real robot, but was surprised at the specifications of the SRX, where it is classified as a super. Ryusei has an odd habit of naming certain attacks, and often shouts them aloud when performing them, รก la classic super robot pilots. He abbreviates some of the SRX`s and Banpreios` attacks with the words \"Tenjou Tenga\", literally meaning \"Heaven and Earth\".\nBefore joining the SRX Team, Ryuusei was a childhood friend with Kusuha Mizuha. Though she initially developed a crush on him, Ryuusei didn`t return the same feelings, either due to his obsession with mecha, or because he simply didn`t share them. He does show some support for the relationship she develops with Brooklyn Luckfield, however. His relationship with the rest of the female cast of Original Generation is still in question, but it seems he is exceptionally close with Latune Subbota and Aya`s sister, Mai. While he doesn`t show much interest in women, he usually says that mechs with feminine shapes and appearances, like Lune Zoldark`s Valsione, Lamia Loveless` Angelg or Virtual-ON`s Fei-Yen the Knight, are cute or sexy.\nRyuusei proves influential to the women he is close with. Both Latune and Mai have begun imitating his otaku nature in attempt to garner his attention, though this has yet to produce any significant results.",
