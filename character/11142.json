  "description" : "Grelle initially appears as a meek woman with long, brown hair tied back with a red ribbon, yellow eyes and round glasses. She dresses in simple clothes to match her appearance.\nHowever, it is later revealed that this is not her true appearance is that of a Shinigami. In her Shinigami form, she has long, red hair, yellow eyes, false eyelashes, razor-esque teeth and red-framed glasses with skulls dangling from chains on the frames. She also wears a suit including gloves and a tie, like the other Shinigami, high-heeled shoes, and a red coat, which she slings off her shoulders and wears around her elbows. Occasionally, her tie is replaced with a red-striped bow.\nShe seems to think highly of her appearance, as she is upset when Sebastian Michaelis attempts to hit her in the face, and she is distressed that she has to appear in her human form with the \"out of vogue\" brown hair and without make-up in front of others.\n(from http://kuroshitsuji.wikia.com/wiki/Grelle_Sutcliffe)",
