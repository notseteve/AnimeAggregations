  "description" : "Yuudachi is a genin from http://anidb.net/ch12202 [Amegakure], though he has a scratch through the village symbol on his headband to indicate his loyalty to http://anidb.net/ch11993 [Pain].\nHe and his partner, http://anidb.net/ch17694 [Ryuusui], are captured by http://anidb.net/ch7213 [Jiraiya]. When they refused to tell Jiraiya any information on Pain, he uses a feather to tickle-torture Yuudachi into giving him the info. When this failed, Jiraiya transformed Yuudachi into a frog, which cowed Ryuusui into divulging info about Pain.\nJiraiya sends Yuudachi to Konoha, where he is interrogated by http://anidb.net/ch16789 [Ibiki]. When Ibiki can`t learn anything from him, http://anidb.net/ch10962 [Inoichi] probes his mind and, after passing through many barricades that were placed in Yuudachi to prevent probing, discovers that Yuudachi used to bring dead bodies to http://anidb.net/ch11994 [Konan], not knowing what they were being used for. He is apparently killed by the Animal Path during the invasion of Pain, although it is possible that he was revived along with everyone else Pain had killed during invasion.",
