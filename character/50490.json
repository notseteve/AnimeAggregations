  "description" : "The VF-0S was a variant of the VF-0 built to be utilized by the more experienced commanders of flight groups. While largely identical to the standard VF-0, the \"S\" variant featured a new head unit with two Mauler laser cannons rather than a single cannon on the \"A\" variant. In addition, the VF-0S removed the integrated control system`s limiters by default allowing skilled pilots to maximize their control of the VF-0S in all modes. Renowned ace pilot http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] piloted a VF-0S during the events surrounding the island of Mayan in 2008. Although only an estimated 4 units of the VF-0S were manufactured, the variable fighter was utilized in a number of sorties and http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Focker] himself piloted several modified variants including a FAST Pack equipped version and the VF-0S Reactive Armor unit.\nNOTE: During development of the Macross game for the Playstation 2, when the VF-0 was being considered for inclusion, it was named \"Phoenix\" (ultimately, the VF-0 was not included in the game). This \"pet name\" was then dropped only to reappear in 2008 on the official Macross Frontier website. The Macross Chronicle (2008) has since made the name \"Phoenix\" official.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrosszero/vf-0s.htm",
