  "description" : "Domino (Japanese: ドミノ Domino), also known as 009 and Black Tulip, is an elite officer within Team Rocket. Her past before Team Rocket is almost completely unknown, and she claims that Domino is not her real name.\nHer true personality remains a mystery. She can be cheerful one moment and all business the next, depending on the situation. She has a quick temper, but can restrain it as the mission calls for. However, when the Boss gets mad at her, she takes it out on lesser agents.\nDomino seems to have a very close relationship\nwith Giovanni, receiving orders directly from him and maintaining phone communications with him at many times, even things that have little to do with the mission. The closeness is furthered by her attempts to reason with him when she thinks his actions will jeopardize his own goal; not many people could talk back to him and get away with it.\nBecause Domino is so elite, Giovanni appears to feel safe in entrusting her with commanding lesser agents. She spearheads the Mount Quena operation, leading a crack team of over a hundred Rocket Grunts into the caves. She also recruits Jessie and James after finding them in a prison, and makes them cleaners of the new Rocket Base, using them while humiliating them at the same time.\nDomino`s high status and approval by the Boss have made her quite vain, and although she uses Jessie and James to help with the base, the first time she reveals herself to be a Rocket, she betrays them, bursting the Meowth Head Balloon.",
