  "description" : "Trevor`s Charmeleon is the evolved form of Trevor`s Charmander. It evolved sometime after the Summer Camp and it was instrumental in helping Trevor defeat Viola to get the Bug Badge. It`s personality did not change as a result of evolving into Charmeleon.\nAsh Ketchum and friends hear it in the bushes and he realized that it was in a battling mood so he asked Trevor to battle. Ash`s Fletchinder was sent out to battle it to help cool down its temperament at the time. The two traded blows until Ash`s Fletchinder was able to finish it off with a powerful Steel Wing. Despite loosing the battle, Trevor`s Charmeleon felt refreshed after the battle.",
