  "description" : "The GX-9900 Gundam X (GX) is one of three advanced mobile suits created by the United Nations Earth Space Force to fight against the Space Revolutionary Army. The Gundam X was the most powerful of the three models mainly because of its powerful weapon, the Satellite Cannon, which was specifically designed to destroy space colonies. Three GX units are known to have survived the 7th Space War. One was found and piloted by 15-year-old Garrod Ran, who later joined the crew of the Frieden. The second was found by the New United Nations Earth, which studied it and develop the Double X. The third was found by Vultures Rick Arel and Rosa II, aboard a sunken UNE submarine.",
