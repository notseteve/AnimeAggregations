  "description" : "Ash and his friends first encountered Cissy`s Brother near the Mikan Island Gym. He put a coconut on the ground and as Ash picked it up, he dumped water on him. He has quite a snarky attitude as he made fun of Ash for falling for his trick and told him couldn`t be a very good trainer.\nCissy`s Brother challenged Ash to a battle but just as they were about to start, revealing that he owns a Pokémon but Cissy`s Brother`s older sister Cissy appeared and wondered if he was causing trouble as he was supposed to be inside cleaning his room. He tried to defend himself by lying to his sister saying he caught Ash sneaking around but Ash quickly defended the accusation.\nCissy`s Brother helps his sister out during the gym battles by using the gyms remote control to activate certain parts of the gym as they are needed. He also started the Pokémon Wave Ride race with a starter gun and cheered his sister on during the race.",
