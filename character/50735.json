  "description" : "Wille is an anti-Nerv organization, dedicated to preventing future Impact events.\nWille was formed following the government disbanding of http://anidb.net/ch5009 [Nerv] after Third Impact and comprised of many former Nerv staff members. It is led by Captain http://anidb.net/ch5007 [Katsuragi Misato]. All staff but Misato and the Eva pilots wear a blue bandanna somewhere on their person, usually tied around the upper left arm.\nIts operations have been based in an ocean fleet, led by the massive flagship AAA Wunder. After http://anidb.net/ch8704 [Evangelion Unit-01] is recovered from space and employed as a power source, the fleet becomes airborne.\nSource: wiki.evageeks.org",
