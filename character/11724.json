  "description" : "Stubborn and fiery redhead Scarlet O`Hara is also the last Ai Tenshi. She is aloof, strong minded, ambitious and despised akuma with a passion until she met Momoko-tachi. Scarlet appeared not to have a family; she lives in a fancy and expensive boarding school.\nEven when she`s with Momoko-tachi, Scarlet really stands out with her maturity. She has few friends, and doesn`t seem to be interested in anything particular. It was revealed later that her desire for independence came from past experience.",
