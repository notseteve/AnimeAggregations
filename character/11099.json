  "description" : "With the Gelgoog, the Principality of Zeon at last creates a mobile suit to rival the Earth Federation`s Gundam. The Gelgoog boasts high performance and sturdy armor like that of the Rick Dom, but it`s also equipped with powerful beam weapons. Although it`s the best mass-produced mobile suit to appear in the war, the Gelgoog arrives too late to change the course of the conflict, and due to Zeon`s manpower shortage it`s piloted mostly by inexperienced trainees.",
