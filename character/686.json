  "description" : "Ben Beckman is the first mate of the Red-Haired Pirates. Beckman appears to be a lot less fun-loving than the other members of the crew and a lot more relaxed, acting as the level headed member. At times he seems amazed at the actions of Shanks, such as panicking when Luffy was taken, or getting even more drunk when he had already drunk a lot before hand when Mihawk brought news of Luffy`s coming. He is first to speak out amongst the crew when they appear. He is also the first to ask questions on situations, such as whether the World Government would try to stop them seeing Whitebeard. Beckman carries a flintlock rifle with him, but he uses it more as a club of some sort than firing it. Beckman appears to have some sort of unknown special power that can be used in conjunction with the gun.",
