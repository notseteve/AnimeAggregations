  "description" : "The Clowns are a group of http://anidb.net/t7110 [ghouls] with a mysterious goal or purpose. Its members primarily wear clown-themed masks. The http://anidb.net/ch69612 [CCG] had planned a famous investigation on them in the 3rd Ward, as mentioned in Ogura Hisashi`s New Book of Ghoul Dismantling read by http://anidb.net/ch67130 [Nagachika Hideyoshi], but their current residing ward is unspecified.\nThere is no data on their member amount, activity area, nor goals in the CCG database. It is stated that the Clowns do not usually group up, but when they do, they demonstrate exceptional teamwork. http://anidb.net/ch74218 [Itou Kuramoto] notes that they are considered ghouls that http://anidb.net/t7112 [ghoul investigators] would rather not encounter.\nSource: Tokyo Ghoul Wiki",
