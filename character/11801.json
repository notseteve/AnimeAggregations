  "description" : "Natsu Dragneel, also known by the nickname \"Salamander\" (火竜), is the main male protagonist of Fairy Tail.\nAside from performing missions for his guild, Natsu travels with his partner http://anidb.net/ch11802 [Happy] in search of Igneel, a dragon who raised Natsu in his youth before disappearing seven years prior to the start of the series.\nHe is a Dragon Slayer (滅竜魔導士), a wizard who can perform an ancient form of magic, or \"Lost Magic\", that grants him the physical properties of a dragon. He specializes in a particular form of this magic called Fire Dragon Slayer magic (火の滅竜魔法), which gives him powers such as breathing fire, emitting flames from any part of his body to attack his opponent, being physically immune to fire, and ingesting any flame besides his own for nourishment.\nNatsu is generally carefree and reckless in nature, and causes most of the collateral damage Fairy Tail is blamed for. However, he is extremely loyal to his guildmates and attacks anyone who tries to harm or insult them. Although he comes across as thick-headed to several other characters, he is a perceptive tactician in battle and can quickly deduce his opponents` strengths and weaknesses.\nHe suffers from motion sickness when riding on vehicles of any sort (trains, carriages, boats, etc.), as well as when carried by others. The only exception to this rule is Happy, who Natsu claims is his friend and not a \"moving object\".\nSource: wikipedia",
