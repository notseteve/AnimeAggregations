  "description" : "Izumi is a cold and distant shinigami assigned the Pediatrics Ward. He can transform into an anthropomorphic dog plushie, but rarely does so because it takes a lot of energy. He likes to call other characters by nicknames. In the manga, he first appears in Chapter 5; in the anime, he appears later, roughly halfway through the series.\nIn the anime, Izumi`s background is not mentioned and he is portrayed as a cold-hearted antagonist. He makes several attempts to steal Mitsuki`s soul, and although he claims to love Meroko, he only seems to do things that cause her pain, as Takuto points out. He is portrayed as a person who does not understand love, mentioned by Meroko, and is also responsible for Takuto and Meroko being assigned to Mitsuki to get Takuto to remember his past life as a human by taking the soul of his former friend`s daughter.",
