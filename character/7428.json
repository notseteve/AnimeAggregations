  "description" : "Hiyama Hikaru is initially presented as being unpleasant, a brawler, and a tougher talker than http://anidb.net/ch7408 [Madoka]. But once she becomes friends with http://anidb.net/ch7407 [Kyousuke], it is revealed that she is actually kind, sweet and energetic, as well as very loyal to those she cares for. Hikaru is also somewhat child-like, specially since she is an only daughter and somewhat sheltered; when she gets extremely excited, she sometimes tends to revert to a form of baby talk, which is seen as cute by Japanese standards. She refers to Kyousuke by the English word \"Darling\" (even before she knew his name).\nHikaru is two years younger than Madoka and Kyousuke, and has the same birthday as Kyousuke (15.11); she also is in the same classroom as http://anidb.net/ch7895 [Hino Yuusaku] and the Kasuga sisters. She has feelings for Kyousuke, who cares for her but more as a sister than a prospect girlfriend, and has been Madoka`s best and almost only friend for several years since she and Yuusaku were the only ones who were never afraid of her. Hikaru befriended Madoka when a bully took away little Hikaru`s favorite medallion, and a pre-teen Madoka witnessed this and stalked the bully until he returned it to Hikaru, sealing the girls` friendship.\nSource: Wikipedia",
