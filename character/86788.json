  "description" : "Celesteela is a dual-type Steel/Flying Pokémon.\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nIt is one of the Ultra Beasts and is known by the code name UB-04 Blaster.\nCelesteela is a large, humanoid Pokémon that is mainly green, with a bodily construction that closely resembles that of a bamboo shoot. It has a horn, that resembles a drill bit that appears to be atop of a structure that is similar to a hat with two small green eyes. There is another structure that stems from the \"hat\" that resembles hair. The lower half of its head is small, with a tiny mouth. Its long neck is divided into three segments; each one of the segments resembles a long, individual neck. Its lower body consists of a structure that is similar to a dress colored in different shades of green. Below the dress, there is what appears to be bamboo stalks. Its huge, disembodied arms resemble stalks of bamboo, with similar projections surrounding a larger opening.\nAccording to the Aether Foundation, its most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself: a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms. This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it is thought to have sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Despite being a Steel type, Celesteela`s body is plantlike and can absorb nutrients from the soil.",
