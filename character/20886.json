  "description" : "Panty and Stocking`s pet sidekick, resembling a green dog with zippers for ears and a tail. He is subjected to various injuries in the series, but recovers extremely quickly. He is often used as a sort of mail box by Heaven, getting struck by lightning and spitting out a clue to a Ghost`s whereabouts. He is only able to say his own name, and has been shown to be capable of driving the Anarchy sisters` car, a roofless pink Hummer H1 called See-Through. His brain is operated by a small red devil in a black suit who can exit through the zippers on Chuck`s head. Chuck himself bears a striking resemblance to a \"disguised\" GIR from the series Invader Zim.",
