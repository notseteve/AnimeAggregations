  "description" : "Anna Yurievna Cocolova, more commonly known as Anya, is Negi`s childhood friend. She secretly has a crush on Negi, and is the only other student who graduated with Negi that has been named. She lives in Wales, but she is probably Russian, since her entire name is Russian. Her specialty is fire based magics.\nShe`s a year older than Negi and their friendship dates from as long as they can remember. It has been noted that Anya is one of the few people who Negi speaks with informally. Anya also helped Negi pack for his trip to Japan.",
