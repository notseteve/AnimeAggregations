  "description" : "Rean Regiostar is the father of the Church of Alexander Mark who died and became a ghost. He is apparently an RPG and dungeon crawler fanatic as he became a spirit because he died from a poison arrow trap in a dungeon he built underneath the church using all the church`s donations. At first he was spiritually bound the the dungeon, but after it was destroyed, he appears in the outside world and now moved to http://anidb.net/ch528 [Nagi]`s mansion, where he follows and haunts http://anidb.net/ch532 [Hayate]. Unfortunately for Hayate, only people who have been in the dungeon before can see him. Despite being a father he is perverted, making Hayate think things he doesn`t want to.",
