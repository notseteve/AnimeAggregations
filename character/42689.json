  "description" : "A Spider-like sinner who sends out miniature spiders who latch onto the necks of her victims allowing her to control them like marionettes. All she desires is to be helpful to Aion. She is one of the six members of Aion`s team and the first one to be killed. Her waist was slashed by Pandemonium`s claws killing off the legion that reside there. As a result, she forever lost the lower half of her body which are now replaced by metal legs much like a spider.\nHer death in the anime is slightly different to the one in the manga. In the anime, she vanished when she fell off the train screaming all the way. In the manga, the upper half of her body is shown floating away in the stream beneath the bridge. Chrono contacts her through one of her spiders and she laments if only he never left. She mocks Rosette one last time before she quietly dies drifting away.\nSource: Wiki",
