  "description" : "Emperor Blaziken was invited to the Vermilion City Pok√©mon Grand Eating Contest and was considered the odds-on favorite. Its eating contest abilities are apparently legendary. It reached the final round of the contest but the final food to eat was the latest culinary craze of Vermilion City, Torchic-shaped sponge cakes, and it refused to eat as Blaziken once evolved from Torchic. Emperor Blaziken unexpectedly forfeited the match but it showed its gentle spirit by not eating the Torchic-shaped sponge cakes.",
