  "description" : "Swellow is the larger and stronger evolved form of the Taillow Pokemon species found in the Hoenn region. It lives as a migratory bird of prey; it constantly flies towards warmer climates in a migratory fashion, and the moment it spots its prey, Swellow dives down at a steep angle and snatches the hapless victim tightly with its talons. It never misses its targets in this respect. Swellow is quite fastidious with its own body, especially its wings. When it is not cleaning its wings and tail feathers regularly, two Swellow are gathered together and unhesitantly take it upon themselves to clean each other`s wings. A Swellow`s tail feathers indicate that the individual is healthy if the feathers are standing at attention. Though it`s name suggests it`s based on a swallow, Swellow has many characteristics of a falcon\nIn the Pokemon anime, main trainer Ash Ketchum owned a Swellow, and he used it prominently throughout his journey in Hoenn.",
