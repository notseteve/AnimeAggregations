  "description" : "The Gung-Ho Guns are a group of assassins assembled to cause great pain to Vash the Stampede. Each one is human, but has sacrificed their humanity in order to gain power, often leaving them mutilated. Each Gung-Ho Gun has an assigned number, but not all numbers are revealed.\nIn the manga, Legato uses them to play a \"game\" with Vash. He has them each carry half a coin, and gives Vash a case that contains the other half of every coin. He explains that if Vash can reassemble the coins (12 in all), something interesting will happen; it turns out that the filled case can block Legato`s powers during their later fight.",
