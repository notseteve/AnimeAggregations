  "description" : "The leader of Team JNPR.\nDespite coming from a long line of Huntsmen, he lacks combat skills. Unlike the other students, he didnâ€™t graduate from a primary combat school. However, he has great potential as a leader and a burgeoning skillset in strategic and situational judgment. Pyrrha recognizes his abilities and helps him grow under her guidance.\nHis weapon is a family heirloom called Crocea Mors. It is a one-handed sword and a scabbard that transforms into a shield.\nSource: Official site",
