  "description" : "Ren is Ai`s second companion, and usually takes the form of a young man. He can manifest a single large green eye that can be directed anywhere, allowing him to see the inside of a building through projecting the eye on the walls and ceilings. The large eye can also be used as a weapon through projecting intense flashes of light. When required, Ren becomes the blue straw doll by kissing a pendant he wears around his neck. Ren`s name means \"one glance company\".",
