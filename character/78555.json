  "description" : "Squishy was one of multiple Zygarde`s captured by Flare Gang to be experimented on at their lab. Mairin`s Chespin managed to enter the room that it was being held in and interfered enough for it to escape but not before Mairin`s Chespin was critically injured. While on the run, it found its way into Bonnie bag.\nThe Pok√©dex couldn`t identify its species so Bonnie decided to call it Squishy because it felt squishy. While attempting to flee from Flare Gang recapturing it, it transformed into its 10% Forme to protect itself from being captured. Professor Sycamore was unable to identify the species as well.",
