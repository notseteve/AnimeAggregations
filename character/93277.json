  "description" : "Nitta Yoshifumi is the main protagonist who takes http://anidb.net/ch93274 [Hina] into his home and somewhat resents her intrusion into his bachelor lifestyle. He is a yakuza of the http://anidb.net/ch95617 [Ashikawa group], where he quickly rises through the ranks thanks to Hina`s abilities and his own prowess at administration. He acquired cooking and housekeeping skills to take care of his mother and younger sister after his father died, and his hobby is collecting rare porcelain vases and urns (which Hina often destroys). His family and fellow yakuza members are convinced that Hina is his daughter from a past relationship.\nSource: Wikipedia",
