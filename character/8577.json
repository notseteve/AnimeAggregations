  "description" : "The successor unit to the GN-001 Gundam Exia and since its name is \"00\" that could possibly mean this Gundam is also the successor of the 0 Gundam. As the premier unit in Celestial Being`s 4th Generation of Mobile Suits, \"00\" (pronounced Double-O) possesses many of the previous generations` standard features, including the GN Drive and Trans-AM System, as well as introducing newer innovation such as the revolutionary Twin Drive System. The system utilizes two GN Drives with compatible GN particles production as the basis for the system`s operation, with their productive synergy generating GN particle emissions which exceed anything produced by a single unit.\nThe 00 Gundam`s arsenal consists of a small assortment of weapons, including GN Beam Sabers and GN Sword II`s--a refinement to the GN-001 Gundam Exia`s existing Seven Sword technology: in particular, the GN Long & Short Blades. Drawing inspiration from the GN Sword, this weapon incorporates a beam rifle configuration to the melee-oriented GN Blade function giving it much needed projectile-fire capability, along with the traditional hand-held approach for more overall versatility. The GN-Sword II firepower is powerful enough to take out an Ahead mobile suit in one shot.\nA tactical drawback of the Twin Drive System is the way the GN Drives are mounted upon 00`s shoulders. They aren`t shielded and depend on the pilot`s capabilities to compensate 00`s weaknesses/deficiencies. Should 00 Gundam lose a GN Drive in combat, it can still operate, but have difficulty of executing higher functions because the unit has high GN particle requirements.",
