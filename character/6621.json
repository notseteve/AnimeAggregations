  "description" : "Takani Megumi, 22 years old, originally forced to make opium for an industrialist, with Kenshin`s support and encouragement, she becomes a doctor to atone for her past misdeeds. Having an attraction for Kenshin herself but knowing that his heart belongs to Kaoru, she takes many opportunities to make Kaoru jealous by asserting herself onto Kenshin (much to Kenshin`s chagrin). Because she is a little older and wiser and can be quite cunning, she is nicknamed \"fox lady\" by Sanosuke. When it comes down to it, she is loyal and concerned over friends and is always there to patch them up (especially Sanosuke). She also tries to \"help\" Kaoru to come to terms with her feelings toward Kenshin so that Kenshin could lead a long, happy life. She is from the Aizu region, now Fukushima Prefecture.",
