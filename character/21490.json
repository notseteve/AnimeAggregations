  "description" : "One of the human girls transported to the strange planet. Yuko has a big mouth and always says whats on her mind, even if this might hurt other people`s feelings. She shows no concern and no interest to the inhabitat`s problems. She only cares about going home and therefore finding Princess Alia. She doesn`t get along with most of the people, especially Eiri, whom she dislikes for her timidness. Although she might seem selfish, she has a kind personality and cares for Eri and the little creatures, but this is only shown occasionally.",
