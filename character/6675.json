  "description" : "This elegant mobile suit is the second in Paptimus Scirocco`s series of handmade custom machines. Comparable in size to the transformable Messala, the Palace Athene is a heavy attack model, whose firepower is sufficient to destroy even the heavily-armoured warships of the modern era. Of course, it`s also formidable in close combat against enemy mobile suits.",
