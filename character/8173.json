  "description" : "Kazuha is a girl from Osaka. She`s been childhood friends with Heiji, and could be referred to as his girlfriend - even though they`re too shy / childish to admit it already.\nWhen she meets Ran for the first time (episode 118) she directly explains to her that Heiji is off limits, and that the girl/woman that wants to get to him has to go through her fast - which makes her either protective or possessive of Heiji.\nLater on Ran and Kazuha become really good girl friends.\nKazuha`s father, like Heiji`s, also works for the Osaka police.",
