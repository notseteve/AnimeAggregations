  "description" : "Tool Toul To is a team originally created to assist the kings with their Regalias. They are a completely neutral group and will assist any king regardless of which side they are on. Each king is assigned a tuner who becomes familiar with the king and acts as their personal tuner. Since the Regalia can be won from a king in battle, the new king would have trouble using the Regalia since the body structure of the old king might differ from the new one. That is where the members of Tool Toul To come in, as the new king will be assigned a tuner who will adjust the Regalia to the king`s personal style and structure.",
