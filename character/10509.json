She and fellow bridge officer http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase Misa] are close friends, and she is often there to give her friend advice on matters of the heart (especially when it comes to http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Misa]`s confused feelings for http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru]), something http://anidb.net/ch7652 [Hayase] is awkward in. She used to be in a close relationship with http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker] until his death.\nShe is known as Claudia Grant in Robotech. Claudia LaSalle does not die at the end of Macross, although her Robotech counterpart does die.It is possible Claudia is a relative of http://anidb.net/ch14116 [Edgar LaSalle] from http://anidb.net/a427 [Macross Zero], who was http://anidb.net/ch14110 [Kudou Shin]`s RIO.\nSource: wiki",
