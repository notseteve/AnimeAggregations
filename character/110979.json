  "description" : "In the episode in which we meet him, the cat is thrown into the river by subordinates of Father Sun. Nagasumi wants to jump to save him, but Sun stops him by saying that she will do better in the water because she is a mermaid. After jumping into the river, she has a problem with the kitten, because he panics and tries to break free. Maki (who was previously rescued by the kitten) comes to help, who, despite being prejudiced against cats, catches him and flies so fast on the shell that the cat does not have time to react, moves him to the shore. Eventually, the story ends with Nagasumi taking the cat in. In later episodes we can often see him in his house, although they no longer show us such an eloquent siren reaction as before, but only sporadic cases of light panic and a distance from the cat.",
