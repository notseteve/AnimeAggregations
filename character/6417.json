  "description" : "The female protagonist. She is a \"Juuden-chan\": someone from a world that is parallel to our own, capable of recharging people who are depressed or unlucky. She is however not very good at it and is a bit of an airhead. Because she has the ability to use phasing, she normally can`t be seen by regular humans. This is done so she can do her job without causing distraction. She loves to watch an ecchi anime series called \"Miracle Witch Milly\". Whilst other Juuden-chan focus on charging people and getting paid, Plug focuses on discovering the root of their problems so that they won`t become depressed again.",
