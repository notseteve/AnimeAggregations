  "description" : "Chizuna`s doctor. A close friend of the Takashiro family since she was a small child. He has a scar that extends from his left eye orbit downward, caused by a bloody wound inflicted by Chizuna years ago. He has been in love and devoted to her for a long time but his affections have not been reciprocated. He`s looking for a cure to the Takashiro \"curse\". He believes Chizuna was nothing but her mother`s replacement in her father`s eyes, and seems to be a bit jealous of Kazuna`s new found relationship with the woman he loves, though he states in the second volume he`s happy Kazuna is around, for it gives Chizuna a reason to keep living.",
