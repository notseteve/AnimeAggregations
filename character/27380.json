  "description" : "Sewaddle, known as the Sewing Pokémon, is a caterpillar-like Pokémon with a leaf around its head. Its parent makes clothes to dress it in once it hatches from its egg. It sleeps with its head covered by its hood. It makes its own clothes by gnawing up leaves and sewing them together with adhesive thread from its mouth.\nSewaddle makes its anime debut in \"Sewaddle and Burgh in Pinwheel Forest!\" where Ash catches one. It evolves into Swadloon while battling Burgh`s Whirlipede.\nGame Informer`s Jeff Marchiafava stated \"I don`t normally like Grass-based Pokémon, but Sewaddle is alright in my book.\"",
