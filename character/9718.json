She spends time with and becomes friends with Pacifica as it is one of the few times she has smiled and laughed since her parents were killed. When Christopher kidnaps her and takes her to the Glass Canyon, Pacifica`s identity as the Scrapped Princess is revealed to her. Although initially confused and unable to accept the fact that her close friend is the \"poison of the world\", Winia eventually comes around, and continues to have a close friendship with Pacifica.",
