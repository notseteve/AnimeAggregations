  "description" : "Maki Shin`ichi is reputed to be the best player in Kanagawa, and was crowned prefectural MVP twice. As team captain, he exerts great leadership over his teammates, who follow his orders to the letter. Though his personality belies it, he can be as strict as Akagi, but mostly only towards Kiyota. He is commonly noted to be very old to be in high schools; Maki responds by pointing out that Akagi looks even older.\nSource: wikipedia",
