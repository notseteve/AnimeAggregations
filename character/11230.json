  "description" : "Ayase Yukiya is the eighteen year-old boy who was betrayed by his own cousin, Tetsuo, and was auctioned off to settle Tetsuo`s debt. He was bought by Kanou for the price of 120 million Yen, and had to pay off the debt by having sex with Kanou for 500,000 Yen each time.\nHe had lost his parents in a young age and had a lonely childhood. Gentle and very naive, he has a hard time expressing himself to people and not very good at socializing. He tends to keep to himself and to act aloof towards people but Kanou has forced himself into his life. He also has a knack for getting in trouble mostly because he does not realize that men tend to feel a very strong sexual attraction to him when he`s around.\nHe is confused about his relationship with Kanou and often feels guilty that he is involved with another guy. In the manga, he is currently trying to change his personality to be a bit more outgoing and more sociable. Gaining Kanou`s permission, he is currently working part-time as a kitchen helper in Someya`s store.\nIn the released artbook, an interview with him shows that his motto is \"you can go far little by little\" and that he washes his left arm first when bathing.\nSource: wiki",
