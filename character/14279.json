  "description" : "Chief Watsup is the chief of the corrupt Roanapur police. He receives a regular stipend from Roanapur`s criminal cartels, as well as the http://anidb.net/ch7754 [Lagoon Company], to stay away from their illegal activities. It is implied throughout the series that http://anidb.net/ch1191 [Revy] tends to cause a lot of trouble in public and he usually has to bail her out much to his chagrin. He gets used to Revy`s trouble making and he and Revy became sort of friends. For the most part, Watsup upholds this deal as long as his benefactors do not cause public incidents. He has dealt with http://anidb.net/ch1198 [Balalaika] on more than one occasion, although she detests him.",
