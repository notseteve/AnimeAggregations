  "description" : "Due to the Bronze Saints` crime against Sanctuary (participating in the Galaxian Wars), the Pope issued the order that they had to be killed. Mozes was one of the Silver Saints sent to deal with them, but due to Aries Mu`s intervention, Mozes killed Black Dragon instead. Thinking they had completed their mission, they retreated, but came back due to Misty and Babel`s late return. As Asterion is one of the few people in the Sanctuary who can use telepathy, he soon discovered that Eagle Marin had betrayed them. After defeating her, he and Mozes used her as bait for Pegasus Seiya by tying her to a pole upside down in the sea. Pegasus Seiya came to them and narrowly managed to defeat Mozes, but was overwhelmed by Asterion`s power. In the meantime, Eagle Marin was able to free herself and fought against Asterion. By closing her mind and thinking of nothing, she managed to defeat him, but let him live and return to Sanctuary with a warning to the Pope.\nSource: Wikipedia",
