  "description" : "In the My-Otome anime Shiho Huit is a Pearl Otome along with Chie and Akane, and her mental instability is used as comic relief, in particular her rivalry and attempts to sabotage the careers of those she sees as insulting of Cardair, her homeland. She has a great rivalry with Juliet Nao Zhang.\nShiho is Pearl number three and the last member of the Trias. She is from Cardair. She is usually seen conspiring to get revenge on everyone else by using a strange voodoo doll. The GEM she wears in episode 24 is the Spiral Spin Serpentine (螺旋の蛇紋石 ,Rasen no Jamonseki).\nShiho is best known for the voodoo-like practices she uses to curse others, a trait that earns her the nickname of \"Uzumaki\" (literally \"spiral\") and her chanting of \"Maki Maki\" (turn turn) which becomes a running gag, as well as the tendency for her sabotage attempts to backfire. After the invasion of Garderobe she takes Lilie Adean and Yayoi Alter into the woods in order to spin for her success, something that eventually allows Chie to break free of her command restraint and take a hit for Arika Yumemiya.",
