She is slender, wears glasses, is bright and cheerful, but is also a bit manipulative as seen when she got everyone to cosplay, a feat even Oono could not accomplish. Yoshitake became one of Ogiue`s paid assistants when Ogiue needed help getting her professional manga ready by the deadline.\nSource: Wiki",
