  "description" : "Parfet Balblair (Parufe Baruburea) is the ship`s chief engineer. She`s a cheerful, nerdy-looking girl with huge glasses and brown hair which she keeps in two large pigtails. Parfait spends most of her time monitoring the Paeksys and the ship`s engines, but also has time to devise other inventions for the crew on special occasions. At Christmas she worked very hard to get a snow machine working for everyone. From the start of the series, she finds herself partnered with Duelo, the two having a common patient. As the series progresses, the two become very close, and by the end seem to have a mutual attraction (she became very jealous when Jura made a dive for Hibiki, missed and ended up grabbing Duelo instead).",
