  "description" : "One of the mascot creatures from the Palmier Kingdom, Coco is a yellow-furred tanuki searching for the Dream Collet to restore his kingdom. He can transform into a human, and later becomes a teacher at Nozomi`s school to keep watch of her. Coco has expressed that he has strong feelings for Nozomi, but is hesitant to act on them because of the knowledge that they will have to go their separate ways as soon as his kingdom is restored. Fittingly, his human name \"Kokoda\" sounds like the way one would say \"I`m Coco\" in Japanese.\nHalfway through the series, it is revealed that he and Nuts are actually princes from separate parts of the Palmier Kingdom.\nHe is given Palmier`s crown in episode 24 of Yes! PreCure 5 GoGo, allowing PreCure 5 to use Cure Fleur. Both he and Nuts combine powers in GoGo episode 38 to allow Cure Dream and Milky Rose to combine powers.",
