  "description" : "Froslass, known as the Snow Land Pokémon, appears to be based on the Yuki-onna, a Japanese snow spirit, hence being a Ghost-type. It bears a humanoid appearance (unlike Snorunt or Glalie). Its main body color is white with a red stripe around the waist and two red fins on her back (designed to resemble a kimono obi). Froslass`s arms are attached to its head as opposed to its torso, and each has a three-fingered hand and a blue fin on the wrist (representing the sleeves of a kimono). The head is round except for a bump on the back and has a purple lower jaw. Two small blue \"horns\" made of ice are on Froslass`s head, along with a purple diamond-shaped crater in the center of its forehead. Froslass doesn`t have any feet, so it floats in the air like its counter-part, Glalie. Its torso appears to be hollow, as it is stated in the Pokédex`s entry for Froslass. A female Snorunt will evolve into Froslass after a Dawn Stone is used on it.\nIt attacks prey and unsuspecting victims in icy snowstorms, where its Snow Cloak ability allows it to go unseen (yuki-onna are said to have skin so pale that they can actually blend into their snow-covered surroundings). To render its foes and victims helpless, it blows an icy wind that can reach as low as -60˚F. Its head has a slight resemblance to Celebi`s.\nA Froslass appears in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness, as a dangerous and obsessive Pokémon, who is attracted to the famous explorer Scizor, who doesn`t exactly return those affections. As a result, she kidnaps him and freezes him in ice. But when the player and partner intervene, Frosslass is stopped.",
