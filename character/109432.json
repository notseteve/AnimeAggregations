  "description" : "Misono Reon is a first-year university student taking up Literature and one of the guitarists of GYROAXIA.\nHe is a stubborn man who is also very exceedingly patient. He`s a hard worker who won`t stop trying something until he excels at it. While he strongly opposes Nayuta Asahi`s dictatorial ways, he recognizes the talent in GYROAXIA, and strongly believes they deserve to be on top. He is the only person who has guts to bear his fangs towards Nayuta, but against someone as unpredictable as him, he always holds back from directly confronting him.\nSource: ARGONAVIS from BanG Dream!
