  "description" : "Mizuki was the prototype for the weapon system which would later be used on Chise. She was an officer who was badly wounded in an attack, but returned to the battlefield because of the prototype weapon system. Initially disdainful of Chise`s behavior, and bitter because of her body`s inability to use Chise`s advanced system, Mizuki began to have second thoughts after seeing what the new system was doing to Chise. She then became an elder sister/motherly figure to the young girl. She also had a crush on Tetsu, her former deputy. Realizing that she was about to die due to extensive damage to her body, Mizuki decided to do one last mission to prevent Chise from going berserk. After her body gave out in the battle, she activated her self-destruction system. But, she managed to return Tetsu`s lighter to him.\nShe appears only in the OVA.",
