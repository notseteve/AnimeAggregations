  "description" : "Corporal. Squad 7 shocktrooper.\nTwenty-seven years old, Brigitte was formerly a bar singer who used the stage name \"Rosie\", and now prefers to be called as such. As a part of the core members of Squad 7, she acts as its signature shocktrooper. Though she may seem overbearing at times, she is a capable front-line commander whose tough talk motivates others during battle. Her prejudice against the Darcsens puts her at odds with Isara and Zaka, though she eventually grows to overcome this.",
