  "description" : "A member of the Mayan people who live in an island on the South Pacific, Mao initially knows nothing but her home, like her older sister http://anidb.net/ch14111 [Sara]. Mao`s fascination with the technology that the outsiders bring masks her deep mystical link to the island`s mysterious alien ruins, a link she shares with her sister. The sudden arrival of http://anidb.net/ch14110 [Kudou Shin] to the island in 2008 sparks dreams of freedom in eleven year old Mao, who then yearns for a life in the cities beyond the island. Unlike her older sister http://anidb.net/ch14111 [Sara], she is carefree and spritelike. She becomes infatuated with http://anidb.net/ch14110 [Shin], impressed by his skill in manipulating and repairing the island`s scarce machinery.\nSource: wiki",
