  "description" : "Yamato is a classmate of Maron, Chiaki, and Miyako and is the class president. Because of his gentle, unassuming nature, he does not get much respect. He initially has a crush on Maron, but later gives up on her and comes to fall in love with Miyako while joining her in trying to catch Sinbad. In the anime, Yamato is depicted as being so innocent and pure of heart that he is particularly susceptible to demon possession.",
