  "description" : "Black Citroid is a criminally programmed android created by Robotics professor and computer hacker Professor Belmondo. The professor hacked into Clemont computer and stole the blueprints for the Clembot. He then used those blueprints to make Black Citroid. The professor believed the Black Citroid was the greatest robot ever created as it was programmed to make sure that winning battles was the most important thing.\nProfessor Belmondo`s plan was to frame the Clembot and then have Black Citroid solve the cases by capturing the Clembot as the culprit. It all backfired when he was confronted at the Miare Art Gallery and he and Black Citroid were defeated in a battle. Black Citroid was arrested along with Professor Belmondo promptly by Officer Jenny (Kalos) after the professor confessed his motives and plan during the battle.",
