  "description" : "Druddigon, known as the Cave Pokémon is a Dragon-Type Pokémon, possibly based on a gargoyle, though its natural appearance also seems to resemble a European dragon. It is a large, blue, hunchbacked, reptilian creature with medium-sized wings shaped like thistle leaves. It has a set of glaring, ferocious irises. Its arms are longer than its legs, giving it a low-slung, sloping gait. It has a thick, medium-length tail and sharp claws on both the hands and feet. Its head is colored bright red, and has several blunt horns and spikes jutting out everywhere. The skin on its face harder than rock. It also has tall, conical spikes—similarly colored red; three on each arm, one on each shoulder, two on each leg, and four on its tail. It has a blunt, brutal snout, bearing a maw with no discernible teeth; instead, small fang-like protrusions sprout from its jaws. Its eyes are pale yellow. It has a series of olive-colored, football-shaped scutes running across its belly. It is a very savage and aggressive Pokémon in that it fights any intruder who enters its den. Druddigon is the only non-legendary Dragon-type Pokémon that is not related to any other Pokémon by evolution. Its name is a combination of dragon and ruddy, a descriptor for anything reddish in color.",
