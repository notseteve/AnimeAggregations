  "description" : "Walpurgis Night is the stage-constructing witch. Her nature is helplessness. She symbolizes the fool who continuously spins in circles. The witch`s mysteries have been handed down through the course of history; her appellation is \"Walpurgis Night.\" She will continue to rotate aimlessly throughout the world until she completely changes the whole of this age into a drama. When the doll`s usual upside-down position reaches the top part of the witch, she completely roils the civilization on the ground in a flash through her gale-like flight.",
