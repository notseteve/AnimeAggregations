  "description" : "Doujou Atsushi is a twenty-seven-year-old member of the Library Task Force and is ranked Library Officer Second Class. He is 165 cm, though is thought to be too short for Kasahara, despite her only being 5 cm taller. He is very rough on Kasahara due to her not inspiring enough trust in him, and the fact that he believes he did not give her adequate recruit training. Part of the reason why he pushes Kasahara so much is that he sees his old self in her, and he is angry that she is bringing that back to him with such emotional force, despite him trying to forget about it.",
