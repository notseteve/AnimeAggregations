  "description" : "Izumo no Okuni is the best informer in Japan. She adores Kyou obsessively, to the point that to be hated by him would make her happy. That said, she joined the Juunishinshou as Indara II, but she does not hesitate to sacrifice herself for Kyou. She then joins Kyou`s team and assists Kyou in finding his real body. She knows many things about Kyou, Kyoushirou, and Sakuya, but she does not speak about it, she merely hints at it. She finds Akira in Kyoto and offers him her own life in exchange for Kyou`s real body.",
