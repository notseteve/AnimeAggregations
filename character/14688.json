  "description" : "She is the next Dark Fall after Michiru and Kaoru; dresses in old Chinese fashion. \"Mizu\" means \"water\" and \"shitataare\" comes from the word \"shitataru\" which means \"dripping, dropping\". She can turn anything related to water to Uzainaa. It seems she`s the one who destroyed both the Fountain of Water and the Fountain of Sky. Saki calls her \"Hanamizu-taare\" (note: hanamizu means nasal mucus) and she`s the one who revealed Michiru and Kaoru are alive and still at Dark Fall.",
