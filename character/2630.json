Aya challenged Ash to a battle with her Venonat and Ash agreed - sending out Bulbasaur. He won the match easily.\nAya appeared again in \"Ariados, Amigos!\" where she was training at a nearby dojo, learning Pokémon Jujitsu. She and her Venonat were unable to master it. But after an encounter with Team Rocket, she was able to bring out her Venonat`s full potential and defeat them. She then returned to the dojo to fully master Pokémon Jujitsu.",
