  "description" : "The Year 730 Mafia was the name given to a small, close-knit group of officers in the Free Planets Alliance military who came to dominate both the political and social spotlight for several years during the Alliance-Imperial War. This name was given them over the fact that the entire group graduated in 730 UC. Centered around the famed tactician Bruce Ashbey, the members of the Year 730 Mafia became celebrities, and their victories on the battlefield would serve as an inspiration for the following generation of soldiers.",
