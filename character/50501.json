  "description" : "The Destroid Cheyenne is an anti-air interception robot designed for use as both fixed and mobile defense aboard carriers. With wheels built for added mobility and high capacity ammunition drum, the Cheyenne was both a respectable offensive unit and a tenacious defensive system. The Cheyenne was also produced in a anti-air missile variant with two missile launching pods similar to the http://anidb.net/ch48997 [SDR-04-Mk.XII Phalanx] (replacing the gatling gun arm units). The Destroid Cheyenne was highly reliable and cheap to mass-produce with existing technology.
