  "description" : "Nene is a girl in Sunao`s class, and is a close friend to Mikan. She normally has a high-pitched voice, but has been shown to alter her voice if she is impersonating another person`s voice. She has a straight-forward personality, and is not afraid to say anything that is on her mind. Nene is very rich and has three older brothers who unilaterally adore her, though they often get her fist in their face. Nene`s mother looks very young for her age (apparently it runs in their family), but she too often receives Nene`s fist.",
