  "description" : "Gargantua is the guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Its arms and legs are chunky and a red glow permeates from its chest, like a heart. But unlike the other floor guardians, it has no personality or will. It is not a custom NPC like the others, but in fact, a bonus from a game administrator, given to http://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz Ooal Gown] for capturing Nazarick under specific conditions.\nSource: Wikipedia",
