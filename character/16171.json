  "description" : "Aa is the Fourth Raikage and the leader of http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure]. He is also the older brother of http://anidb.net/ch13998 [Killer Bee], the jinchuuriki of the Eight-Tailed Giant Ox. As it is hinted that Killer Bee is a member of the Yotsuki clan, A is likely a member, as well. Knowing http://anidb.net/ch7721 [Nii Yugito]`s and Killer Bee`s immense powers if they were to ever transform into their full demon forms, he forbade at least Killer Bee from doing so.",
