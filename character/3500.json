  "description" : "Ragnarok is Crona`s Demon Sword partner. Ragnarok is the first inhuman weapon introduced in Soul Eater. He loves to degrade and pester Crona (even during fights) by giving Crona noogies, pinching Crona`s nose, hitting Crona on the head, or taking Crona`s food. When Crona finally tells Ragnarok to stop, Ragnarok seems surprised at Crona`s reaction. Ragnarok has taken to absorbing any soul, evil or not.",
