  "description" : "Despite being a kendo prodigy, she does not see it as a hobby, but rather just as a chore honed at her home, which happens to be a kendo dojo led by her father. She refuses to join the school`s Kendo Club because she thinks it is unnecessary, but temporarily becomes a member in order to fight off a bully. She despises injustice due to her overdeveloped sense of righteousness and fair play inspired from watching tokusatsu (her favourite being Blade Braver, a show within a show) as a child. She remains a big anime and tokusatsu fan despite her age. At first she is very shy and unsociable, but after holding a part-time job at Miyako`s acquaintance`s store she begins to overcome her shyness and open up to her teammates more often. Kirino and Sayako (and for that matter, most girls in the story) find her very cute, often putting Tamaki`s hair up in ponytails or making her fight in kendo matches just because they want to see her fight. She knows Yuuji before the series`s beginning, and has been called \"Tama-chan\" by him since their childhood (although she does not like the nickname very much, since it makes her seem childish).",
