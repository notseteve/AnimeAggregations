  "description" : "Meguru is a close friend of both http://anidb.net/ch6567 [Misaki] and http://anidb.net/ch6568 [Yuu]. In middle school, she was a national champion in swimming, making her a reserve candidate for the Olympics. However, Meguru quits swimming when she enters high school because her breasts grow too large and attract too much attention when she`s in her swimsuit. Unfortunately, those who are attracted don`t include http://anidb.net/ch8891 [Takei], whom Meguru secretly likes. She also wears small bras in attempt to make her breasts look smaller. Her friends encourage her to to not be ashamed of them, and not hiding them. She eventually joins the school swimming team, at first to save the team from closure (due to the fact that it had only five members and one of them quit) and taking the position as team manager, and, after some prodding from Takei, eventually as one of the swimmers.",
