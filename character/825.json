  "description" : "Delibird resembles the rockhopper penguin, or possibly a snowy owl. It has red and white plumage and is always pictured carrying a sack with it, giving it a Santa Claus-like impression, although its \"sack\" is actually a long wavery tail, like a ribbon. Delibird is said to make its home at the edge of steep cliffs. It spends all day searching for food, which it stores in its sack/tail and brings back to its chicks. Delibird are known to save the lives of many lost and starved mountaineers by sharing their food with them.\nOn the other hand, a Delibird under attack will fling its stored food at the opponent as a projectile weapon. This is perhaps the basis for its signature attack, Present, which is an attack only Delibird can learn, as well as the only attack Delibird can learn naturally (through leveling up). In the video games, Delibird is a relatively rare Pokémon; it appears in icy caves, during swarms in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, and as a Shadow Pokémon in Pokémon Colosseum. Delibird can also be caught in Icefall Cave on Four Island of the Sevii Islands, only in Fire Red.\nDelibird`s anime debut was in the episode \"Dues and Don`ts,\" in which a Delibird belonging to Team Rocket follows Jessie, James, and Meowth around under orders to collect the enormous debt the three have amassed during the years with constant requests for Pokémon-shaped mechas and other devices. This Delibird appears in several episodes in the series set in Johto. Another Delibird, a helper of Santa Claus, appeared in \"Delibird`s Present,\" an episode of the Pikachu`s Winter Vacation 3 holiday special also shown as part of Pokémon Chronicles.",
