  "description" : "Houmei is the Priestess of Seiran`s Tower of Rain Water. Centuries ago, she tried to destroy the world. Due to that, she was imprisoned in the forbidden lands of Konron. She later joined the `Luminous Knights` as their tactician. Despite her appearance, she is actually 3000 years old.\nNote: In the game, she is actually of the same dragon race as http://anidb.net/ch19131 [Hyouun] although doesn`t look like it. An event in the game explains this connection. In the anime, she is referred to as an elf.\nSource: Wikipedia",
