  "description" : "Salamence is very happy at its successful acquisition of wings, yearning for them since being a Bagon, and expresses its feelings by soaring all over the sky, blowing fire from its mouth. Salamence is just as easily expressive when enraged: when angry, it loses all thought and destroys everything around it with its fire breath and shredding claws. Salamence is a very strong Pok√©mon because of its incredible attack and special attack, and therefore highly desirable to trainers. However, Bagon and Shelgon, its two pre-evolved forms are difficult to train and level up.\nSalamence (and its pre-evolved form Shelgon) cannot be found in the wild, so Salamence must be evolved from a Bagon which can be found in Hoenn`s Meteor Falls. However, Salamence was obtainable at a Nintendo promotional event in which it was given out to players with the rare move Wish.",
