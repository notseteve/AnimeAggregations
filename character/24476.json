  "description" : "Konoha watches over a forest near Suiren Town. She warned Ash and Brock about a Mojumbo that would absorb the power of their Pokémon, especially ones with a large body.\nKonoha went with Ash and Brock looking for Dawn and her Manmoo which were somewhere in the forest. When she found them, she saw Mojumbo near a big tree. She explained that the tree is precious and protects the forest.\nKonoha asked Mojumbo if she could help heal the tree which had been split in half by lightning. She instructed the Pokémon to use Focus Growth on the spot where the nutrients flow though the tree. After the tree was healed, Mojumbo agreed to help protect the forest with Konoha.",
