He has large yellow feet tipped with black talons, and his beak is also yellow. He will valiantly fight any Pokémon that attacks and not give up until it wins. He will use his talons to crush Berries, and he is capable of using many aerial and wind-based attacks. He is exclusively found in Pokémon White.
