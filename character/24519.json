  "description" : "Air Battle Master McCann owns a powerful Scizor, which he has trained in order to skillfully use the wind currents when it is battling in midair with other Pok√©mon. Ash and his friends first saw it when it was battling against a Chimecho in a practice battle between McCann and his granddaughter. It later battled against Ash`s Gliscor and managed to avoid all of its opponent`s attacks by taking advantage of the wind, which led to its absolute victory over Gliscor. Scizor was used again by McCann in his rematch battle with Ash, but this time Gliscor proved to be a more challenging opponent with its newly-learned Giga Impact attack. Scizor, however, managed to pull a close win using its powerful Hyper Beam attack.",
