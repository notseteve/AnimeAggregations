  "description" : "The great villain of the series, an evil god who wishes to destroy the world of humanity and create its own realm, a place of darkness and nihilism. Like its counterpart from Japanese mythology, the Orochi of Kannazuki no Miko has eight \"necks\", its eight worshipers and followers, who are also called Orochi by association. Each of the eight possesses a mecha, which is both an \"other self\" for the Orochi members and an embodiment of a lesser god (which rise time and again from the ashes of destruction), which forms part of the evil deity Orochi`s body. Each individual follower has exaggerated personal characteristics; there is some indication that the evil deity granted its followers great physical strength and endurance, a limited capacity for teleportation and levitation, as well as a unique power or weapon to suit their individual character. A follower who has the willpower to repress the wellspring of rage that rises in their minds when Orochi claims them can use the powers they have gained against Orochi. The evil deity, unfortunately, administers a dire punishment to those who resist it. Orochi chooses its followers from those who have experienced great pain in their lives and have given in to despair. The six evil Orochi fit easily into archetypes, consisting of a sociopathic criminal, an unintelligent brute, a former pop idol, an anti-social manga artist, a catgirl, and a disillusioned nun.",
