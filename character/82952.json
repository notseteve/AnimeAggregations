  "description" : "Lillia`s Buneary met Clemont`s Bunnelby in a forest when it found the ball that had been kicked into the nearby bushes where Clemont`s Bunnelby and the others were playing. Clemont`s Bunnelby had gone looking for the ball but Lillia`s Buneary was holding it when they met. Lillia`s Buneary quickly became infatuated with Clemont`s Bunnelby and they spent time together while Clemont and Lillia got to know each other. While being respectful and nice to Lillia`s Buneary, it was clear Clemont`s Bunnelby didn`t share the same affection towards her. Clemont`s Chespin and Serena`s Pancham both fought to gain Lillia`s Buneary attention but she didn`t want to associate with them and was only interested in Clemont`s Bunnelby, presumably because it was a fellow rabbit. The two parted ways when Lillia decided to go her separate ways, but it was clear that Lillia`s Buneary still liked Clemont`s Bunnelby and was a bit sad it had to part.",
