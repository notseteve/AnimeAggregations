  "description" : "Yutaka studied at Tokyo University. He is arrogant and enjoys boasting about his \"superiority\". He thinks he will be the qualified detective, often becoming the comic relief in the series. He is initially in Class A after joining DDS, but later gets demoted to Class B in the manga. He knows Minami Megumi via the Tokyo National Talent Development Research Center and has a crush on Megumi`s older sister Akane alongside Kinta in one episode in the anime. Although he has an IQ of 180, he seems too inept in solving mysteries.\nSource: Wiki",
