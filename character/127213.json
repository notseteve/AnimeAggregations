The two briefly met before the match with Wikstrom, who they had both trained with at different times. The match featured a lot of strategy and making sure that their Pokémon were not completely knocked out and could be used again later in the match.\nThe match came down to Ash`s Dracovish and Drasna`s Noivern clashing with Dragon Rush and Dragon Pulse and Ash`s Dracovish was the one left standing which gave Ash Ketchum the match victory and raised his Pokémon World Championships ranking from 15th to 9th.",
