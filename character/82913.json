  "description" : "Sheril Kamelot is the Fourth Disciple of the http://anidb.net/ch10022 [Noah Family], representing the \"Desire\" of Noah and is truly named Desires. He is the adoptive father of http://anidb.net/ch82914 [Road Kamelot] and the elder brother of http://anidb.net/ch84615 [Tyki Mikk].\nHis power seems to be a form of telekinesis, as he is seen crushing his target`s limbs without touching them, and manipulating the movements of the Science Department team. He is also seen to manipulate objects, as he did with the pipes that bound http://anidb.net/ch81263 [Alma Karma].\nSource: Wikipedia, edited.",
