  "description" : "While practicing for the Junior Cup, the power went out as Dragonite hit one of the transformers while trying to land after a battle with a Hydreigon. The power station people thought that the Roughneck Dragonite was trying to disrupt the power but they didn`t realize it was injured. It wasn`t until Iris heard about the situation and realized that it was injured and she tried to protect it. Cilan, Ash and Dawn found a video camera that recorded the battle between Dragonite and Hydreigon to show to Officer Jenny who then backed off when she realized that it really was injured.\nDragonite was taken to Nurse Joy (Isshu) who helped heal its injuries and was free to go. Just as it was leaving, it turned back to look at Iris and Cilan realized that it wanted to stay with Iris then caught the Roughneck Dragonite.",
