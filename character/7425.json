  "description" : "Hunter`s spider (though Shadow disagrees in the beginning), a prideful warrior who thinks he doesn`t need a rider and is also very stubborn and won`t admit when he`s wrong, especially one who may be destined to bring disaster to Arachna (i.e., Hunter). He hates large crowds. He is said to have legendary strength. He complains about most of the things Hunter does, though they make a very good team. Shadow is a direct descendant of the Ancestral Lord of Spiders. Shadow cares for Venus.",
