  "description" : "A very stressed worker, Sakano worships Touma and tries to be the perfect business man for him no matter what. Sakano takes every opportunity, though he`s not as conniving as K. Sakano has a tendency of panicking that often makes him seem like nothing but an overly nervous salaryman. Nevertheless, he takes Bad Luck seriously, and has even gone against Touma in order to secure their success.",
