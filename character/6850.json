  "description" : "A 17-year-old alchemy warrior that was assigned to take care of a homunculus problem in Kazuki`s town Ginsei City.\nWhen Kazuki tried to save her from a homunculus she felt a sense of attachment to him and revived him with a Kakugane, intending to make sure that he never gets killed again.\nTokiko is very dedicated to her job, claiming that she hates all homunculi, and quit going to school in order to be more efficient.\nThis hatred comes from the trauma she suffered as a little girl, when all the people in her school were killed or eaten by homunculi. The incident also left her with a horizontal scar running across the bridge of her nose and across her cheeks.\nAs such, she is serious almost all the time, which leads to some awkward situations between her, Kazuki, and his friends. Though her scar could have been easily removed by the power of alchemy, Tokiko had decided to keep it as a reminder of her desire to kill all homunculi.",
