  "description" : "A young man who finds himself engaged to Yuuri after a mistake. He is a `bishounen`, which means a pretty or beautiful boy. He is very feminine looking, with a beautiful face, shoulder-length blond hair and long eyelashes. His appearance is so influential, that several dying people in the hospital have a miraculous recovery after laying eyes on him. Wolfram possesses fire magic, as well as being adept with a sword. He is the half-brother of Conrad and Gwendal. He has extremely high pride and is hot-headed. He is arrogant and short-tempered but can also be quite compassionate at times. He is called \"little lord brat.\" He is the only one of the previous queen`s three sons who inherited her emerald green eyes and blonde hair, bearing a striking resemblance to her. It seems he inherited fire magic and selfishness from his fathers side. Wolfram is obsessed with Yuuri and insists on following him everywhere as he claims it is his duty to protect his fianc√©, though he also seems to want to prevent him from cheating on him. His ancestor, Rufus Bielefeld, fought alongside the Original King.",
