  "description" : "An unusual young girl with cat ears who looks after the dormitories where many of the students live. She was nicknamed `God` for unknown reasons and the students do not dare disobey her for fear of vague, yet frightening threats. She has a pet dog, Yonakuni, who helps her take care of the place. Her rule of the dorm extends to manhandling Father Kanae after repeatedly demanding bribes so that he can see Kanako. She has an idiosyncratic speech pattern which makes her speak in a rather languid fashion and insert wherever grammatically possible the phrase `desu yo`.",
