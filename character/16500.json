  "description" : "Mrs. Bradley is the wife of the Führer, http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley]. A kind and trusting wife, she has no idea that her devoted husband is inhuman and remains blissfully ignorant of the homunculi`s existence and dastardly plans. Though she rarely appears in either series, usually accompanying http://anidb.net/ch14960 [Selim], Mrs. Bradley`s appearances usually fall under the category of comic relief as she speaks jovially of her familial life and romantic past with the Führer.\nMrs. Bradley is later on kidnapped by http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Roy Mustang] under the cover of the night. Though he has no intentions of harming her, Mustang hopes to use the Fuhrer`s wife as a sort of shield against Central`s forces in his uprising against the city. When direct orders from Brigadier General Clemin call for everyone but Mustang to be killed -- including Mrs. Bradley, she begins to truly question her husband`s emotions towards her and her entire life. Under the pretense that it was the government itself which had betrayed the Bradley family, Mrs. Bradley is taken to a local radio station by http://anidb.net/ch10166 [Maria Ross], http://anidb.net/ch14596 [Kain Fuery] and http://anidb.net/ch14598 [Heymans Breda], where she makes it clear there had been an attempt made against her life to a nationwide audience. She is eventually told that her husband had been in a fatal train explosion, making her almost faint from the shock.",
