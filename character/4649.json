  "description" : "Honoka is a cheerful young girl who works as a freelancer. She`ll take on almost any job, though she doesn`t really care for mercenary work. Because she spent most of her childhood in the desert, she`s a bit of a tomboy (and is often teased about it). Bogie, her A.I. partner, has been with her since she was very young, and she`s come to care about him just as much as he does for her. Honoka has many layers to her personality; she`s strong yet gentle, aggressive yet vulnerable.",
