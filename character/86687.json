Its four thin limbs have bulbous hands or feet.\nRibombee uses its fluffy hair to hold pollen it collects from flowers. Rain causes its hair to become dirty, so it only visits fields if the weather will remain clear. The pollen and nectar its collects is used to form balls called \"Pollen Puffs\". Pollen Puffs have a variety of uses. These balls can be used as food, to attack and paralysis or dizziness, or even relieve tiredness with a soothing effect. The Alolan people sell Pollen Puffs as valuable supplements.",
