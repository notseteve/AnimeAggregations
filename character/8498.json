  "description" : "Aika was the first friend http://anidb.net/ch1286 [Akari] makes on Aqua. She is the only daughter and heir of http://anidb.net/ch125951 [Himeya Company]`s owners, but does not enjoy the distinction as she feels the company`s employees fawned on her too much.\nAika speaks bluntly and often responds to Akari`s idealistic comments with \"Embarrassing remarks are not allowed!\" (恥ずかしいセリフ禁止!, Hazukashii serifu kinshi!). Despite their contrasting personalities, she gets along well with Akari and http://anidb.net/ch8499 [Alice], but frequently squabbles with her mentor, http://anidb.net/ch8505 [Akira], whom she resembles.\nAika considers herself reliable, especially compared to distractable Akari and antisocial Alice, but both her friends call her a crybaby for her tendency to tear up when emotional. She is proud of her gondola skill as an Undine, and can be very competitive about it.\nShe is promoted second out of three; Alice was recently promoted from Pair to Prima, and Akari was still a Single. Aika received the title \"Rosen Queen\" (薔薇の女王[ローゼン・クイーン], Bara no Joou, lit. \"Queen of Roses\") upon her promotion.",
