In their first year of elementary school, she was friends with Mitsuo. In that time, she made a promise to marry Mitsuo, and ever since had been making her plans so that everything would come out perfect, and showing them off to Mitsuo. Since they now both attend the same university, she asks Banri about Mitsuo`s schedule, relentlessly following after him.\nSource: Wiki",
