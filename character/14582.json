  "description" : "Sasaki Rika is a classmate and friend of titular character Sakura Kinomoto. She is considered to be very elegant and mature for her age, though she can also be shy. During the series, she is also shown to be a skilled cook and very good at crafts. During the series, Rika is affected by the Clow Cards several times. Early in the series, she buys a brooch that is actually The Sword card. The card takes her over and causes her to attack Sakura. Sakura is able to stop Rika by using The Illusion card to show her an image of her beloved, allowing Sakura to capture the card. During the second half of the series, she is nearly drowned during a magical trial Eriol created to cause Sakura to convert a Clow Card to Sakura Card.\nDuring the series, Rika is shown to be in a romantic relationship with her teacher Terada Yoshiyuki. Rika gives Terada the hand-made teddy bear she made, and he names it after her. When Sakura uses the Illusion card to stop Rika`s attacks, she calls the image \"Sensei\" which means \"teacher\" in Japanese. During the final judgment when Yue shows Sakura a world where everyone has lost their feelings for the one they love the most, Rika is shown handing Terada a paper without her usual blush and shy look.",
