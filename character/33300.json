Her parents open a soba restaurant across the street from Kitamura Sporting Goods the summer of Ko`s second year of high school.\nShe is an excellent artist, and won the grand prize of the Koshien Poster Art Competition using Aoba as the model for a pitcher. She is enrolled in Seisen Private Girl`s Academy.\nAkane becomes a waitress at Coffee Clover because she does not get paid working at her parents` restaurant, and becomes close to Aoba, telling her she always wanted a younger sister. Akane has suffered from an unknown disease since childhood, and the summer of her third year of high school is admitted into the hospital for tests leading to surgery. She promises Ko she will go out with him after she is discharged. This is later forgotten as she sacrifices her own feelings towards Ko and helps Aoba show her feelings as well. It is shown that she shows kindness towards Akaishi.\nSource: wiki",
