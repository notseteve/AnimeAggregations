She actually appears younger than Narue when she shows up due to complications in the method of space travel (time-dilation). Kanaka is surprised and confused at what has happened while she was away and acts rashly at first, causing trouble. She soon adjusts to her family on Earth, though Kanaka still has a bratty, mischievous personality.",
