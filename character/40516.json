  "description" : "The Dragons of Earth, also known as the Seven Angels, are a group of seven individuals who are fated to stand against the Dragons of Heaven in the apocalyptic battle on the Promised Day to determine the fate of the Earth and humanity. The Dragons of Earth ideologically represent the belief that conflicts between man and nature cannot be resolved peaceably, and that humans are on an irreversible path that will ultimately lead to the murder of the planet itself unless they are stopped. Unlike the Dragons of Heaven, they are only very loosely confederated, and while Monou Fuuma is nominally their leader they mostly do whatever pleases them.",
