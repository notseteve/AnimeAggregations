  "description" : "Murasame is a living spirit sword rumored to hold sway over all things without shape or form, but it is said that whomever the sword possesses will meet a violent and tragic end. The blade ordinarily takes the form of a crow and speaks in human language, concealing itself on http://anidb.net/ch49442 [Shino]`s right arm when resting. Murasame sometimes picks and eats food that somebody dropped, and Shino scolds Murasame for the behavior.\nSource: ANN",
