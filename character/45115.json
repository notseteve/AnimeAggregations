  "description" : "Media, who enrolls in class 1-D after her first appearance in the anime as The Professor`s assistant, is sent to Momotsuki High to keep an eye on http://anidb.net/ch9100 [Becky]. She possesses superhuman strength and is always cheerful. She resembles http://anidb.net/ch9112 [Ichijo] in that she does the seemingly impossible, but she does this much less frequently than Ichijo. She and http://anidb.net/ch9137 [Behoimi] have a past together that they vaguely allude to but never explain fully. Media is nearly always smiling and never opens her eyes, except for one instance in episode 9. Also, she is almost never seen without wearing her trademark maid outfit in the anime. In later episodes, she attempts to persuade Behoimi to take on her role as the healing magical girl once more, even in one episode putting a smaller version of her magic wand in her hand, trying to invoke a response, but Behoimi does not fall victim to her suggestions. Apparently, she and Behoimi once fought. Similar to Behoimi, her name is a reference to a moderate healing spell from an RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei.\nSource: Wikipedia",
