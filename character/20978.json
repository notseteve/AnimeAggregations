  "description" : "Verde is the holder of the Green Pacifier, and his Animal Partner appears to be a crocodile or alligator. Verde was briefly mentioned by Reborn as the person who sent assassins to kill Tsuna. Apparently, Verde has knowledge about camouflage and invisibility; so, he gave his subordinates suits that can make them invisible to everyone but children. Verde believed that he should be able to see his subordinates in case they ever tried to sneak up on him in an attempt to kill him. Verde is also one of the three scientists who developed the Box Weapons in the Future, where he is said to be dead. He doesn`t seem to care about anything except his experiments, even going as far as to destroy anyone who would resist, including the other Arcobaleno. However, he will repay debts that he owes. In the anime, Verde was said to break the \"pact,\" which might be explained later in the manga. Verde and the rest of the Arcobaleno are brought back to life from their Pacifiers when Yuni is brought towards Byakuran and Tsuna. Verde and the rest of the Arcobaleno are fully revived erasing all the damage in the Future. Verde engages Irie in conversation about exactly how humans can comprehend the calculations for such a phenomenon.\nSource: reborn.wikia",
