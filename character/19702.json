  "description" : "Bandou Mitsuru, sometimes referred to as the \"Cyclops Hammer\", specializes in close combat, using his ultra-destructive punching power as his main weapon. When coupled with the speed of his AT, Mitsuru`s punches result in damage of diabolical proportions. During the Behemoth vs Kogarasumaru challenge he fights Ikki and is thoroughly defeated. With the arrest of Akira at the hands of the Wind swat team, Bandou now seeks to establish his own Storm Rider team. Mitsuru has a strange appearance, as his eyes are completely black. His immense strength is the result of a genetic condition he was born with that means his muscles are up to nine times more dense than a normal humans. He shares this condition with Udou Akira.",
