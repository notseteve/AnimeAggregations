  "description" : "Bora was once a mage that worked for the Titan Nose Guild but he was kicked out for using magic to aid in thievery. After this he started his own gang and continued his thievery under the guise of \"Salamander\". At one point, he was Juvia Loxar`s boyfriend or friend for a short time but he became annoyed with her rain so he broke up with her. The relationship was apparently very short.",
