  "description" : "Naua is Chiaia`s father and a member of the Barrier Workshop. He was the one who found the Seikishin and Doll in the ruins of what once was a highly advanced civilization prior to Chiaia`s birth. Upon finding Doll in the ruins, he adopted her as Mexiah, who would later be Chiaia`s adoptive sister. When Kenshi and the rest of the Swan`s crew come to visit, he reveals the history of the Senshi Civilization, the Seikishin, and how Doll came to being. He and his team get the results to show that Kenshi is the legendary warrior and the child of third artificial human (with a few enhancements).\nSource: Wiki",
