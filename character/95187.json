  "description" : "While sleeping one night, Ash had a dream where Solgaleo and Lunala appeared to him at the Altar of the Sun and moments later Starcloud came out from the light. He made a promise to them to watch over the Cosmog. The next day on the way to school, Tapu Koko appeared and directed Ash to where the Cosmog was sleeping. He picked it up and took it to the Pokémon School where no one was able to identify the type of Pokémon that it is.\nLillie decided to call the Cosmog \"Starcloud\" because its inner body shines like twinkling stars and it floats gently in the air much like a cloud, so its name is a combination of the the words star and cloud.",
