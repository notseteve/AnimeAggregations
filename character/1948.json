  "description" : "Roa was a high-ranking priest of the church who at one point held a major position within the Mage`s Association but began to spy on the latter for the former, highlighting his long career of betrayal.\nHe sought immortality and tricked Arcueid into drinking his blood, causing her to go berserk and wipe out almost all the True Ancestors. This action also turned Roa into one of the most powerful Dead Apostles. In fact, he had gotten to the point where he was so powerful he was strong enough to defeat even Altrouge Brunestud when she tried to \"teach him a lesson\" as her and the rest of the Dead Apostles saw him as an upstart.",
