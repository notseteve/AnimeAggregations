  "description" : "Tomo Takino is extremely energetic and competitive, despite being nonathletic and a slacker at the same time. She tends to irritate everyone around her, especially Yomi, who has been her classmate since elementary school. Tomo`s character is extremely impulsive and never considers nor cares about the consequences of anything she says or does. During the second trip to Chiyo`s summer house, Tomo actually grabbed Chiyo`s house keys and threw them into the forest because she wanted to see what would happen if they had lost them which, of course, was a very bad idea. However, on the occasions when Tomo has actually been inspired to concentrate on something, she has demonstrated that she is quite capable.",
