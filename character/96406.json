  "description" : "The 13th Fleet was a unit of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets] Star Fleet. Formed shortly after the Battle of Astarte in 796 UC, its command was granted to recently-promoted Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. The flagship of the 13th Fleet was the http://anidb.net/ch82015 [Hyperion].\nFollowing the Alliance`s devastating defeat at the Battle of Astarte, the 13th fleet was formed out of the survivors of the http://anidb.net/ch96403 [2nd], http://anidb.net/ch96404 [4th] and http://anidb.net/ch96405 [6th] Fleets, supplemented with new-recruits. Composed of both newly constructed warships and vessels still bearing damage from the Astarte fiasco, the 13th Fleet was only about one-half the typical size of a Free Planets Alliance fleet, numbering only 6,400 vessels and 700,000 personnel at its inception.\nIts original command group included Rear Admiral Yang Wenli as Fleet Commander, Commodore http://anidb.net/ch751 [Edwin Fischer] as Deputy Fleet Commander, Captain http://anidb.net/ch752 [Murai] as Chief of Staff and Commander http://anidb.net/ch793 [Fyodor Patorichev] as Deputy Chief of Staff.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
