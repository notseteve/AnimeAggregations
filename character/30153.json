  "description" : "Gertrud is a witch born from negative emotions, who loves roses more than anything else--her barrier is full of them. She uses humans` life energy to feed her roses and hates humans entering her barrier. Her minions are Anthony and Adelbert. She and her barrier are presented in a surreal manner with bizarre cut-and-paste-style photo collages. She also seems to like mustaches as both of her minions have some. The special page has confirmed that the mustaches are set by the witch herself. Her \"body\" has parts from a butterfly, and butterflies are seen in her barrier at many points.\nSource: Puella Magi Wiki",
