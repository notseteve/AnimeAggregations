  "description" : "Ox is one of the top students at Shibusen in terms of grades and is Harvar`s meister. He is named after the University of Oxford. He calls himself the \"Skilled General Lightning King\" a fact that annoys Black Star because they are two different titles `King` and `General`. He also has one-sided feelings for Kim, which he does not hide. Later in the series when he attempts to rescue Kim from Arachnophobia and displays his sincere adoration for her, Kim starts to reciprocate his feelings. He constantly studies, but claims that outside he is a beast. One notable feature he has is his hairstyle which is shaved except for the sides, which are styled into ox-like horns, he styles it this way every morning. His attacks focus on using Harvar`s lightning powers on contact. He can also perform anti-air and anti-ground attacks.",
