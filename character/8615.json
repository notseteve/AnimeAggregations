  "description" : "Nara Shikamaru was in the same class as http://anidb.net/ch226 [Naruto] at the Ninja academy and is now part of a team with http://anidb.net/ch8616 [Ino] and http://anidb.net/ch8617 [Chouji]. He is very laid back to the point of being lazy; he often sees missions as troublesome. He is quite close to his team leader, http://anidb.net/ch7742 [Asuma], and the pair regularly plays shougi together. Shikamaru specialises in jutsu which manipulate shadows, but his true strength lies in his ability to think up the best strategies for defeating an enemy.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
