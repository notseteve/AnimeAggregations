  "description" : "Shimazaki Shougo is http://anidb.net/ch17292 [Yuki]`s older brother, who becomes an angel prior to episode two. Although most angels succumb to their primal desires quickly, Shougo`s exceptional willpower allows him to retain consciousness for a very long time, which he uses to exact revenge upon people who previously maltreated him. After he finally loses his consciousness and attacks http://anidb.net/ch16960 [Rin], she has to kill him by impaling him with a tree branch. http://anidb.net/ch17293 [Apos] expresses desire to obtain Shougo`s time spore but Rin instead gives it to http://anidb.net/ch16963 [Maeno], who eventually uses it to become an angel himself, saving Rin from http://anidb.net/ch17287 [Sayara]. After Maeno is killed by Apos, his time spore falls into the ocean and is lost until episode five.",
