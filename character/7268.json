  "description" : "Otonashi Souichirou is Kyouko`s late husband. Kyouko and Souichirou met during high school when she was a student there and he was a temporary teacher. They eventually married, albeit with great opposition from Kyouko`s family. Souichirou died of an unspecified cause (accident is implied), leaving Kyouko a very young widow.\nAs a running gag, his face is never shown in the series (usually to Yuusaku`s frustration), always either in shadow or otherwise obscured in photographs.\nSouichirou`s family, especially his father, is still very close to Kyouko who still holds on to the Otonashi family name.\nThe name Otonashi translates literally as \"without sound\", and Souichirou literally, as \"all one\", and means \"most important\".",
