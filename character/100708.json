  "description" : "BELO is the third YOUKAI-NINGEN who has a cool stance towards the world and human being. He is skilled in gaming and usually spends all his time in the game arcade of Outside with his friends. This might be because he wants to escape from inconvenience and cooped-up feeling to live as a YOUKAI-NINGEN, without concerning about unnecessary things. He always wears a headphone, pretending not to listen to the story of others, because he wants to keep some distance from a human society. He often says ironic things to BEM and BELA, but he give much thought to them so that they don`t get hurt.\nHe fights against the evil with his agility. He does not have a special ability, but there is a sign of the development.\nSource: Official page",
