  "description" : "Keiko is one of http://anidb.net/ch7082 [Nanami]`s sidekicks, who follow her only because she has a crush on http://anidb.net/ch7004 [Touga]. Her jealousy, though as simple as Nanami`s is strong enough for Mikage to take advantage of her mind.\nKeiko is Nanami`s best friend. Like many other girls at the school, she has a secret obsession with Touga. Keiko is in love with him and wishes only to be with him. She is also very insecure and has low self-esteem. However, she knows that Nanami`s clout and Touga`s rank makes it impossible to even approach him.\nShe is tossed out of Nanami`s circle after she shares an umbrella with Touga, and becomes a Black Rose Duellist. Later on, she becomes one of Touga`s many girlfriends upon learning that he and Nanami are not actually related, so she lets Nanami know exactly what she thinks of her. Later, Nanami beats up Keiko, http://anidb.net/ch7322 [Aiko], and http://anidb.net/ch7324 [Yuuko], and they are seen following her once again. In the series finale, all three are seen together again without Nanami.",
