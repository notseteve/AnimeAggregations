  "description" : "A quiet, young girl with a rather blunt personality who wears Miko attire. While she may seem normal, she is also known as \"Deep Blood\" and has the ability to kill vampires, as her blood`s smell attracts vampires who die when they approach her. However, it made her miserable because with the exception of sucking blood, vampires were just like humans. This prompts her to go to Academy City, hoping to find a way to get rid of her powers, until she meets the alchemist http://anidb.net/ch2730 [Aureolus Izzard].",
