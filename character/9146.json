  "description" : "Ryuunosuke is a classmate of Ataru. She is a girl, but her eccentric father has raised her as a boy, going so far as to demand that she wrap her breasts in tight cloth strips to hide them. Even her name sounds masculine, roughly equivalent to \"Duke\" or \"Butch\" in English. Ryuunosuke is a kind person at heart, but her father is always antagonizing her and pulling her into very destructive knock-down, drag-out fights, one of the reasons for their extreme poverty. She and her father run the school store, and live on-campus in the back. Her greatest desire is to wear girl`s clothing and behave appropriately for her gender, but she has had no female role models in her life. Any attempt to obtain feminine clothing is thwarted by her father.\n(Source: Wikipedia.com)",
