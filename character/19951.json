  "description" : "Fran is the newest officer member of the Varia in the Future who uses a Hell Ring with the numbers \"666\" (Number of the beast) imprinted on it. Introduced during the Varia attack on a Millefiore base in Italy, Fran is Mammon`s replacement as the group`s Illusionist and is thus forced to wear a large frog hat to symbolize this. Fran has a calm demeanor despite being very antagonistic towards the other people, constantly verbally attacking them. According to Reborn! Volume 25, his profile is top secret, but he was featured alongside Bel in Reborn`s Weekly Horoscope as a Sagittarius.\nIt was later revealed that his master is Mukuro Rokudo, who was released from the Vendicare Prison thanks to Fran`s help.\nSource: rebornwikia",
