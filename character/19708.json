  "description" : "Sano Yasuyoshi, known as \"Aeon Clock\", is an extremely intelligent individual who is able to create the illusion of manipulating the flow of time using the Flame Road. He is originally part of Spitfire`s team, following the same road, until he decides to leave and join Behemoth. After Behemoth`s defeat he joins with Genesis, serving as Simca`s advisor, counselor, and occasional chauffeur. He eventually also serves Ikki and his team in the same manner. Although he is normally serious he is often used as a comic relief, with his \"homosexuality\" being a recurring gag. He is very close to Mimasaka Ryou and may also be attracted to her, as he is apparently furious at the Takeuchi brothers after she is \"killed\", which is contrary to his usually calm and rational demeanor.\nHe is eventually shown to be working under his father`s orders in an attempt to obtain the Sky Regalia, though he has his own goals. He helps Spitfire fight Sora and Nike though he is defeated and thought to be dead along with Spitfire. He is later shown to be alive and once again working for Genesis when he steals the Flame Regalia from Kazu, with no explanation to his apparent betrayal. However, the battle had left him scarred and with most of his body replaced with prosthetic, and Mimasaka on life support. After a confrontation with Sleeping Forest, a tracker on his body is inadvertently destroyed, and he reveals that Genesis had been using it to keep track of him. Free of listening ears, he asks Mikan to relay to Ikki that he is still loyal to him. However, because Genesis still has Mimasaka imprisoned, he cannot rejoin him.",
