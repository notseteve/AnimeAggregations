  "description" : "Pignite, a Fire Pig Pok√©mon, is the evolved form of Tepig. Its appearance is somewhat similar to its pre-evolution except that it stands on its two feet and is adorned with golden features on its chest. When mad, its power increases which comes from the food it ate and converted to fuel. In addition to that, its speed and sharpness also increases.\nIn the anime, Pignite made its debut appearance in Minccino-Neat and Tidy! under the ownership of Bianca.",
