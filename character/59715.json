  "description" : "Haruka is Yuu`s closest friend since junior high school. She is the childish one out of the two. She often pushes Yuu to her demands unknowingly (like kissing her just to keep her quiet), and is the extremely jealous and clingy type of person as described by Yuu. Haruka seems to harbor romantic feelings for Yuu, a reason why she is more affected by their seat arrangement than Yuu is.\nSource: Wiki",
