  "description" : "A large, white, \"mangy\" dog, found as a stray by Souichirou Otonashi. He was originally named \"Shiro\" (\"Whitey\"), but he only responds to the name \"Souichirou\" and so Kyouko insists on calling him \"Souichirou\" in memory of her husband. Other than providing comic relief, he serves to remind both Kyouko and Yuusaku of the man he was named after, and serves as a foil to Shun Mitaka. Kentarou enjoys playing with him and considers him his pet.\nIn Ranma Â½, volume 7, page 158, Souichirou`s name appears on a box saying \"Please take me home. My name is Souichirou\" while Happousai is hiding under it.",
