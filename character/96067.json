  "description" : "The Dominion of Phezzan is one of the three realms, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) with connections to Terra. It is technically a part of the http://anidb.net/ch95944 [Empire] and pays tribute, but it also maintains a relationship with the http://anidb.net/ch95945 [Alliance]. Ruled by a domain lord called the landsherr, Phezzan gains power by acting as both the paragon and trickster, providing the only link between the Empire and Alliance whilst simultaneously playing the two sides against one another.\nSource: Wikipedia",
