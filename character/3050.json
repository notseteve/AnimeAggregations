  "description" : "Known as the Protean Assassin (千変の刺客), she is a shapeshifting, magic-using girl with a playful, yet sadistic personality who has the ability to take on any physical form, and one of the Swamp Witch`s strongest minions. She can transform into a pink liquid substance to create objects, move from place to place, and imitate people by taking on their shape. One noticeable use of her shape-shifting ability is her hair, which turns into hands that hold up her breasts and cover her nipples. Her primary offense is squirting acid from her breasts. In the first episode of the anime, she is defeated by Leina by jamming her enormous breast plate against Melona`s acid squirting breasts, which caused Melona`s breasts to balloon with acid until they explode.\nCreated by F.S.",
