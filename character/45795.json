  "description" : "A mysterious woman known as the Phantom Warrior who aids the Rebel Army. In reality, her true identity is Leina, the Exiled Warrior and the true victor of the last Queen`s Blade tournament who had given up her title as Queen to her half-sister Claudette to travel the world. However during her travels, she contracted a mysterious disease that requires her to sleep 16 hours a day. Not only does she need to sleep that long, she also experiences sudden cases of narcolepsy, often requiring her to retreat to her hideout whenever she feels drowsiness. Nonetheless, she is a well-revered warrior who is loved by many. Due to the fighting spirit ingrained in her body, even when she falls asleep due to her curse, she viciously attacks all who approach her carelessly. She has joined and helped Annelotte`s party on several occasions, but has a tendency to act alone.\nSource: Wiki",
