  "description" : "A stuffed animal resembling a lion cub handmade by Rosa, who gave it to Maria for her birthday. Maria managed to give Sakutarou a soul through magic, and since then, he became Maria`s best friend. Though Maria sees him as being able to talk freely, everyone else sees it as Maria merely speaking through a toy. His human form resembles a young boy with blond hair, and wears a yellow sweater with overly-long sleeves and a tail, a red scarf, and a cap with lion ears. His name was originally intended to be \"Sakura\", named after a parody of the manga and anime Cardcaptor Sakura, but since \"Sakura\" is traditionally a female name, Maria derived from it and added the male suffix \"tarou\".\nHe was destroyed by Rosa during a fight with Maria prior to the main events of the series and, due to Rosa`s refusal to accept him afterwards and her own subsequent deaths in 1986, it is impossible for Beatrice to revive him. However, Sakutarou is later miraculously revived by Ange.",
