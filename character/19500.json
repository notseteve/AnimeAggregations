  "description" : "Kanou Soutarou is a withdrawn male student who is initially against http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki] as the student council president because of her aspirations of increasing the female population of Seika High. In order to sabotage her presidency, Kanou tries to hypnotize http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki], http://anidb.net/ch15148 [Usui], and the student council into ruining http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki]`s reputation. It is revealed that his gynophobic attitude comes from his mother abandoning his family when he was young (ironically the very opposite of what http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki] experienced) and his father warning him to be wary of women, and after failing to hypnotize http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki], she punishes him by assigning him to work closely with his female classmates during the school`s cultural festival, in hopes of forcing him to get over his fear. The punishment is ultimately successful, and he slowly becomes friendlier with http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki] and the rest of his female peers, as well as with http://anidb.net/ch15253 [Yukimura] (who gives off the aura of a female, as Kanou states).\nThough he runs against http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki] during her re-election as President, he opposes using underhanded means to gain victory, remaining on good terms with her. He also knows about the relationship between http://anidb.net/ch15148 [Usui] and http://anidb.net/ch15147 [Misaki] and often wonders why they won`t admit that they like each other.",
