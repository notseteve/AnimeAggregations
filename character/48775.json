  "description" : "The fan racer is a small, single-pilot aircraft often used in flight contests or for recreational flying. Built for speed, the fan racer features a ceramic rotary engine and a double-fan jet propulsion system. For additional speed and rapid bursts of acceleration, the fan racer has a series of six rocket boosters positioned around the aft fan exhaust. At the time he visited South Ataria Island in February 2009, then civilian pilot http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijo Hikaru] owned and operated a fan racer as part of an organized flight team. Upon arrival, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] in his fan racer carelessly interrupted the \"Angel Birds\" flight demonstration of the VF-1 Valkyrie, being presented to a crowd by http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru]`s sempai http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy Focker]. When http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy] berated http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] over the radio for his meddling, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] performed a daring boost rollover, breaking up the Angel Bird`s formation, dazzling the audience and showing up http://anidb.net/ch10505 [Roy] (a maneuver taught to http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] by his sempai). With this fan racer, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Hikaru] won the Amateur Pilot Competition seven times.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/sdfmacross/fanracer.htm",
