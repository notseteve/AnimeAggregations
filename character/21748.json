  "description" : "Lotton the Wizard is a mysterious-looking man and one of the bounty hunters hired to capture \"Greenback\" Jane. He has silver hair, wears a black trenchcoat and shaded glasses, and speaks in a light voice. He does not drink alcohol (he claims he`s allergic to it). He gets shot by Revy when he tries to make a fancy entrance. It is implied that he is not a mighty fighter, but a poser. However, he did survive a fall from atop a warehouse building after getting shot due to his Kevlar vest, so the full extent of his abilities is still in question. He worked with Sawyer and Shenhua in helping Garcia fight off the Colombian Cartel, who were trying to kill Roberta.",
