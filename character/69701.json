  "description" : "Shauna`s Bulbasaur is Shauna`s starter Pokémon given to her by Professor Sycamore. It was first seen in the anime when it was called out to be shown to Serena who thought it looked really cute. Shauna`s Bulbasaur is shy of strangers and a little unsociable. It won`t eat food unless Shauna`s the one giving it and it`s also not very expressive.\nIt has starred in some of Shauna`s PokéVision videos. Despite its normal tendencies, it looks very cute when it runs and also its cry is cute.\nSerena`s Fennekin first official debut Pokémon battle was against Shauna`s Bulbasaur on the first day of the Pokémon Summer Camp. Despite the type advantage, it had a hard time in the battle. It was a fun battle and Serena made various discoveries while Shauna taught her a lot. The outcome of the battle was not revealed though.",
