  "description" : "The Re-Estize Kingdom, commonly referred to as The Kingdom, is a human nation located to the north-west of http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick]. Throughout the nation`s history, it has been plagued by corrupt and inept nobles who view commoners as mere pawns in their power plays. In recent years, they have even started to attempt to usurp the king`s authority and take control of the Kingdom. To make matters worse, the Baharuth Empire annually declares war on the Kingdom and criminal organizations are undermining the nation from within.\nSource: Wikipedia",
