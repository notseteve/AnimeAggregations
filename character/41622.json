  "description" : "Liliana was an infamous pirate that laid waste to the Continent`s coastal waters. She is the granddaughter of the Pirate Queen Artemis, the writer of the Pirate Aesthetics, a set of rules which Liliana follows. After she met her untimely death by the sea monster Kraken, she was resurrected by the Swamp Witch to become the leader of her undead army in her plot to take over the Continent. Despite being a scoundrel, she has elegant manners like a noble, which is one of the rules from the Aesthetics. She also has a weakness for elderly people, treating them with great care. She has the ability to summon a flying pirate ship and its phantom crew members through the Swamp Witch`s power. However, it becomes a crumbling phantom ship over time, later disappearing. She fights using a rapier and a crossbow. Created by http://anidb.net/cr28083 [Morisawa Haruyuki].\nSource: Wikipedia",
