  "description" : "Saturn is the being behind Pallas`s actions, as well the one the Primary Pallasites, Europa, and Mira, directly swear allegiance to. He created the Chrono Tectors and gave the Primary Pallasites their Holy Swords. In order to examine humanity, he became a human boy: Subaru. After a battle with Koga in space, Saturn realizes that his friends still care about him despite his betrayal and concedes defeat, declaring that he is still a Saint, and sends Koga back to Earth.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
