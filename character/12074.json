  "description" : "A quieter and more level-headed complement to his best friend Kodai Susumu, Shima becomes chief navigator and helmsman of the Yamato. He suffers from a lack of self-confidence in his ability to control the mighty vessel, despite skilfully saving it on many occasions. Shima and Kodai have frequent arguments, some of which escalate into physical brawls, but the end result only makes their friendship stronger.",
