  "description" : "As the war approaches its fiery conclusion, Zeon`s scientists and engineers have begun working on a new generation of weapons to surpass the mobile suit - huge, non-humanoid fighting machines known as \"mobile armors.\" One such weapon is under development at Ginias Saharin`s secret base on the Tibetan plateau. The bulky body of the mobile armor Apsalus houses a huge mega particle cannon. and a \"Minovsky craft\" system, which pushes against the Earth`s surface and enables the Apsalus to soar through the atmosphere at high speeds. Hoping that this ingenious new weapon will change the course of the war, Ginias entrusts it to his sister Aina for flight testing.",
