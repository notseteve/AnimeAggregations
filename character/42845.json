  "description" : "Ousawa Miu is the daughter of the Demon King Maou Gallious. She was entrusted to Akatsuki by her father, and Akatsuki brought her back to Earth where she was pressed into Babel School, and took Akatsuki`s surname `Ousawa` as she was posing as his long-lost younger sister. She has extremely large breasts, so big that they frequently break the buttons on her uniform or bra, and leave an opening on her gym clothes big enough through which her cleavage is visible. She is rather shy and timid and is initially afraid to make friends but soon enough becomes close to Kuzuha and Chikage with her \"brother`s\" prodding.\nShe has rather significant magical ability, being able to use magic from several elements at once, where most other magic-users are restricted to a single element (though she seems to favour air magic in particular) and generate magical shields with hardly any effort. Her AD takes the form of a staff with an ornate head, called Holy Tin. She has so far used this only for blocking attacks but presumably it helps in her magic use.",
