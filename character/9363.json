  "description" : "This second-year student appears as a tomboy and plays enough sports to have every team clamouring for her to join them, but indulges in a few feminine pursuits, such as a love of boys. She has a very straightforward and down-to-earth personality that sharply contrasts with the cheery and optimistic Nozomi. Her parents run a flower shop. Rin wears red-orange, and she transforms into Cure Rouge; her counterpart is her best friend, Cure Dream. She introduces herself as \"Red Flame of Passionate, Cure Rouge!\"",
