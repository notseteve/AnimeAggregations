  "description" : "Another mobile suit developed in anticipation of their assault on Earth during the First Neo Zeon War, Neo Zeon`s AMX-101 Galluss-J is a slightly less impressive performer than the AMX-009 Dreissen. However, the ease of its production leads the Galluss-J to see at least limited production on Neo Zeon`s frontlines. Intended to work in concert with the AMX-102 Zssa, the Galluss-J is well-suited to urban combat and cleanup operations following a target area`s bombardment. In addition to a light ranged armament of missiles and a handheld energy gun, the Galluss-J is very good for hand-to-hand combat, as its hands can launch outward to deliver extra kinetic force to its punches. The fingers of the Galluss-J`s left hand are also equipped with small-caliber machine guns inside them. One of the earliest Galluss-J units to be built is employed by Neo Zeon officer Mashymre Cello, who uses this mobile suit to attempt to ferret out the refugee AEUG battleship Argama from its hiding place inside Side 1`s Shangri-La Colony. An artillery variant, the AMX-101K Galluss-K, is also developed. Several Galluss-J and Galluss-K units are used by Zeon remnants in an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base in U.C. 0096.\nSource: mahq.net",
