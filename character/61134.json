  "description" : "He is the older brother of Belgium and Luxembourg. Initial notes described him as a tsundere who is xenophobic and thinks little of using drugs, which may be referencing to the semi-legality of soft-drug consumption in the Netherlands, and is hinted to have a lolicon fetish. Current notes describe him as neurotic and solemn, obsessed with cleanliness and money and doesn`t like to be tied up. He has a pet bunny and beat up Finland and Sweden and drove them out of the New World. He has disliked Spain since the 80 years war although he mostly appears in the group formed by Spain, South Italy, Belgium and himself.",
