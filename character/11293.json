  "description" : "The titular female character, Mafuyu is the adopted daughter of St.Mihailov`s last dean, and the self-appointed protector of Yamanobe Tomo. Upbeat and cheerful, she is so proficient in kendo that she carries a wooden sword with her all the time. She has to endure hardship on a daily basis in form of her classmates picking harshly on her and especially Tomo. This changes when she encounters Sasha for the first time, where she starts living with him and, little by little, is pitted herself in the fights between Qwasers. Though at odds with Sasha`s coldness, Mafuyu has started to open up to him and the two have formed a stronger bond. A running gag has Mafuyu hit heavily Tomo when the latter makes mistakes.",
