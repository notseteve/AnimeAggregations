  "description" : "Colonel Otto Frank von Wahnschaffe was the 12th regimental commander of the Rosen Ritter, taking charge after the defection of Luneberg. While he had extensive combat experience, and had been generous with his men, once he became regimental commander, he became servile to his superiors and arrogant towards his subordinates, possibly attempting to curry favour to get on to the general staff.\nWhile on a reconnaissance mission on Van Fleet 4-2, his patrol was attacked by Luneberg. He was severely injured in the crossfire, and though Schonkopf and his men were able to evacuate him, he died on the operating table back at the base. He breathed his last at 0640 on the 31st of March, SC 794 IC 485.",
