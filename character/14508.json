  "description" : "A spy for Judas and Luka. Shiva appears to be rather obsessed with Judas and hates the Saint Beasts, especially Shin. Prior to the ascent to the Holy Summit to choose the Six Saint Beast, Shiva entered the Forest of Darkness and got a demon to attack Shin who nearly succeeded (he managed to poisoned him by inflicting a wound on his left biceps), if weren`t for the timely arrival of Judas. Shiva was the 5th candidate to reach the Holy Summit, but due to his encounter with the demon, Zeus (who sees everything with his transparent crystal ball) rejected him the position.\nAttribute: Darkness\nAbility: Transforming into others (for a short time)\nImage Color: Indigo",
