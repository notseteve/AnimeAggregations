  "description" : "Yume`s personal attendant and also the head for the security of Kuonji mansion, known for her blue hair and eyepatch, and love of food. When in battle she takes a Muay Thai stance. If it has something to do with obtaining food, she is shown to have superhuman abilities. Out of all the characters she is the only one that does not overlook Yume. According to Ren`s observation, she had always wished for having a little brother and thus Ren calls her \"big sis\". Her name means \"Southern Star\". She used to grow up in an island together with her younger sister and brother, however due to a tsunami incident, she lost her family and her right eye. Personality wise, she is depicted as almost dog-like (abundant energy, fetching the paper by leaping ridiculously high in the air, a love for meat products, a vicious fighter when her master is in need of her, incredibly loyal, but relatively easy to fool or distract, etc.).",
