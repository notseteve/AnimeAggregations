  "description" : "Doctor White is a physician of humans and Pokémon who works at a village clinic in a rural area in the Kalos region near Miare City. He rescued Jessie and her Wobbuffet after they fell into the water after being exposed to Stun Spore by a Gloom. As a doctor, he visits people personally and does his rounds throughout the village.\nHe is an amateur berry grower but he needs the Berries and medicinal plants for his patients, so he grows them outside his clinic. A local farmer provided him with some fertilizer for his plants after he cured his Diggersby.\nJessie fell under the Florence Nightingale effect after she was rescued by Doctor White. She worked as his assistant for a little while and even contemplated marrying him until she found out that he liked his childhood friend Berry. After he thought that Berry might have been hurt by a Pokémon Hunter, he confessed his feeling for her.",
