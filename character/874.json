  "description" : "Grovyle is the evolution of Treecko. The leaves that grow out of Grovyle`s body, as well as its matching green coloration, provide excellent camouflage against the background of its native habitats, the forests and jungles. But even if spotted, Grovyle has little trouble escaping danger. Its powerful thigh muscles make it very adept at climbing trees and jumping from branch to branch very quickly, disappearing into the forest and eluding its pursuers.\nIn the anime, Ash Ketchum`s Treecko evolves into Grovyle. Its personality does not change much; Grovyle is as much of a loner as Treecko was, and it loves the challenge of a battle. It also habitually keeps a twig in its mouth, although larger than the one it used to keep as a Treecko. When Ash returns to Kanto to take the Battle Frontier challenge, Grovyle is one of the Pok√©mon he takes with him. Ash continues to use Grovyle until its evolution into Sceptile.",
