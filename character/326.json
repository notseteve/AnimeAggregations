  "description" : "Weepinbell is a bell-like Pokémon that resembles its pre-evolution Bellsprout, but without the vines and leaves. Instead of walking, it hops along or hangs on to tree branches and vines using the large hook on its rear end. Weepinbell immobilizes its enemies by using Poisonpowder and Acid. It will swallow anything that moves and digest it within its stomach, and produces a neutralizing fluid to keep from being affected by its own strong stomach acids. If its prey is larger than it, it will first use sharp leaves to slice it up before eating.\nPlayers can obtain a Weepinbell by catching it in the wild, evolving Bellsprout upon reachng level 21, or Snagging a Shadow Weepinbell in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness. In Pokémon Ranger, enemy Weepinbell can swallow the protagonist whole, knocking him or her back to the beginning of the area.\nWeepinbell has appeared in relatively few episodes in the Pokémon anime. It first appeared in \"The School of Hard Knocks,\" and later when Celadon City Gym Leader Erika battled Ash with one. James` Victreebel was also briefly seen as a Weepinbell.",
