  "description" : "Raticate, known as the Mouse Pokémon, is a larger and stronger form that Rattata takes when it gains enough experience. In the main Pokémon game series, a Raticate is only acquired when a Rattata grows past experience level 20 and is evolved into a Raticate. Compared to a Rattata, a Raticate is far more of a predator, and the majority of its features are adapted for this purpose. Its whiskers give it balance and it slows down if they are cut off. Its webbed feet allow it to swim as it hunts prey, and its fangs are tough enough to topple concrete buildings.",
