  "description" : "Shaymin, known as the Gratitude Pokémon, is a hedgehog-like legendary Pokémon that premieres in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. Its body`s fur is pure white and instead of quills, Shaymin has green grass growing on its back along with pink flowers growing on the sides of its head, giving it an even more flower-like appearance. Its cry is similar to birdsong. Shaymin resides in the Flower Paradise, a flower-filled field untouched by humans. You find it at level 30. In order to go unnoticed by intruders or attackers, it utilizes its own form of camouflage, rolling up into a ball resembling a flower in a patch of grass. By doing so, it blends in with the surrounding flowers, going undetected even if the attacker is beside it. Shaymin also has the power to decompose the toxins in the air and turn the land into flower fields in an instant. It is rumored to have turned the desolate area of Floaroma Town into a fertile field. The only way to capture Shaymin without the use of glitches or cheats is to receive the item Oak`s Letter from a Nintendo Event. It is featured in the movie Giratina and the Sky Warrior. A new form has been confirmed for Shaymin called the Sky Forme, which appears in Pokemon Platinum; in this form, it appears more as a terrier than it does a hedgehog, and has large wing-like ears. Its signature move is \"Seed Flare\".",
