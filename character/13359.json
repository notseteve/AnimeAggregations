  "description" : "A new transferee into the Constan Magical Academy, he is foretold by the Yata Garasu to have the eventual destiny of Demon Lord. This causes much controversy and fear among the rest of the students of the Academy once this becomes widely known, although some remain by his side. The Empire takes an interest in him as well, although it is unclear what exactly their plans for him entail.\nDespite his frightful destiny, Sai Akuto appears to be a good person, and is actually rather kind and friendly, especially to the few who have befriended him and the women who have become attached to him, such as Hattori Junko and Soga Keena. However, he is also a staunch atheist who believes that the various gods that humanity has are really personifications of an oppressive system, and that humanity would be better off without gods or religion.",
