  "description" : "Porygon2 is an improved version of its pre-evolution Porygon. It has enhanced abilities, including increased potency in combat. As opposed to most evolved Pokemon, Porygon2 is shorter and lighter than Porygon. Its artificial intelligence has been developed to such a degree as to give it the capacity to learn on its own from its surroundings and experiences. This results in Porygon2 occasionally exhibiting behavior or motions that were not included in its original programming. Porygon2 was originally intended to be used as a space probe. Unfortunately, since it cannot fly, such an application has been abandoned. Silph Co. seems to have fixed that problem in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl; Porygon`s evolved form, Porygon-Z, can hover above the ground.\nPorygon2 evolves from a Porygon that has been traded while holding the Up-Grade item, and will evolve into Porygon Z if it is traded while holding the Dubious Disc item. Porygon2 also makes two cameos in the fighting game Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is one of an assortment of Pokemon that can emerge from a Poke Ball item, and a collectible Porygon2 trophy can also be obtained.\nPorygon2 has never appeared in the Pokemon anime, due to the controversial Pokemon episode: Dennou Senshi Porygon.",
