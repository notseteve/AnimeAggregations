  "description" : "At the start of the series, Galatea is Claymore Number 3. She is one of the more kind-hearted Claymores. She is a master at sensing Yoki, being able to sense other Claymores from a long distance, read their emotions, and see their actions as if she were close by. She uses this to act as the organization`s \"eye\". She can also control other people`s actions by subtly manipulating their Yoki flows.",
