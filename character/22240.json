  "description" : "The final production version of the Astray series, designed for use by the Orb Union`s national defence forces. The M1 Astray was developed by Morgenroete, using technology that the company obtained from its work on the Earth Alliance`s GAT-X series. Based on the prototype Gundam Astray, this machine has been redesigned for mass production, and is equipped with a backpack flight unit inspired by the Strike Gundam`s Aile Striker pack. The M1 is more than a match for the mass-produced mobile suits of ZAFT and the Earth Alliance, but its production and deployment have been delayed until its operating system can be adapted for use by Natural pilots.",
