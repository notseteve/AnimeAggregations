  "description" : "Ezra Vieil is a part of the bridge crew of the Nirvana, and she is an operator, although most of her work appears to surround communications. Ezra is kind and cheerful, and always seems to be able to cheer people up with her kindness. Despite the animosity between women and men, Ezra has become a kind motherly figure to Dita and Hibiki. She also agreed to be a Fama, and is pregnant throughout much of the series, displaying symptoms(in which she wanted to eat most of the time, and in one episode she had a craving for something sour)that seem to be a mystery to the men on the Nirvana.\nEzra`s kindness is repaid to her when she has her baby, as the crew all help her through bringing her child into the world. Although it is difficult for her at times to be a mother, Ezra tries her best in order to care for the baby and make sure that her \"Ohma\" Rebecca is proud of her.\nEzra does not appear in the manga.",
