  "description" : "The Gawain is a sixth-generation prototype Knightmare Frame developed by Schneizel el Britannia, and is about twice the size of other Knightmare Frames. It is the first Knightmare Frame in the series to feature an integrated float system thus being capable of sustained flight, and features a double-seater cockpit, although it can be operated by a single person. Its fingers are miniature Slash Harkens, and its Hadron Cannons, especially after Rakshata Chawla`s modifications, are devastating long-range weapons. The Gefjun Disturber installed by Rakshata also has the side effect of making the Gawain invisible to radar. The prototype Druid System installed on the Gawain, originally intended to study the Thought Elevators, gives the it the ability to plot the probable movements of enemy units. Despite its rather impressive firepower, it is a comparatively slow unit, and can be easily outpaced by faster Knightmare Frames such as Gloucesters.\nThe Gawain was stolen by Lelouch and Kallen from Schneizel`s expeditionary force during the incident at Kaminejima island, and later became Lelouch and C.C.`s personal Knightmare Frame.\nThe Gawain was destroyed when C.C. entangled Jeremiah Gottwald`s Siegfried and sent both of them to the bottom of the ocean. The Hadron Cannons were salvaged and incorporated into the Ikaruga, the Black Knights` flagship, as was the Druid System, which later became a key part of Lelouch`s second personal Knightmare Frame, the Shinkirou.",
