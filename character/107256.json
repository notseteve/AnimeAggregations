  "description" : "Drednaw is a dual-type Water/Rock Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves from Chewtle starting at level 22. It also has a Gigantamax form.\nDrednaw`s sharp jagged fangs are powerful enough to chomp on rock and iron. It can move very fast despite how extremely heavy the shell on its back is. This highly aggressive Pokémon can extend its neck very quickly to chomp down on its enemies. Drednaw are notoriously vicious to the point it requires a skilled Trainer to fully tame and handle it. Some Trainers will release Drednaw into the wild once they find they are unable to handle it.\nIn its Gigantamax transformation, it stands on it hind legs in a bipedal position. Drednaw uses its massive body to crush its opponents and then its massive jaws to finish them off. The power of its jaws has been enhanced to the point where it can bite through metal towers. By combining the strength of its jaws and powerful neck, Drednaw is capable of punching a hole through a mountain with one strike. According to one tale, Drednaw stopped a flood by using the rubble from a mountain it chewed up.\nDrednaw is the only known Pokémon capable of using the moves Jaw Lock and the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Stonesurge.",
