  "description" : "The largest \"ship class\" vessel of the Zentradi forces, the Gol Boddole Zer-Class Mobile Fortress served as the mothership for the Zentradi for 120,000 cycles and in Space War I. Decorated in the familiar green hull of the Zentradi forces, the sprawling Gol Boddole Zer mobile fortress appears almost organic in design, resembling vegetation. At some 600 kilometers in width, the vessel was bristling with weapons and functioned as a mobile port for the Zentradi ships of the line. Most impressive of all, the Gol Boddole Zer mobile fortress featured a powerful main beam gun located in large globe at the bow of the ship. When fired, the beam gun produced a broad beam of energy that could destroy thousands of smaller warships or even a vessel as large as itself with but a single shot. Though the gun could only be fired once (due to damage over the many years of interstellar warfare), Zentradi leader Gol Boddole Zer utilized it to destroy the Meltrandi mobile fortress in the final battle of Space War I. However, http://anidb.net/ch49057 [Boddole Zer]`s victory was achieved only at the cost of destroying thousands of his ships in the line of fire, a decision that ultimately brought about his own demise. Some 1,000 ships of this same class continue to operate in the Milky Way Galaxy at the end of Space War I.Source: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/gorgbodolzaa-mobilefortress.htm",
