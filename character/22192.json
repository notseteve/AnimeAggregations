  "description" : "A four-legged mobile suit developed as a successor to the BuCUE. This model is larger and more powerful than the BuCUE, with a two-seater cockpit for its pilot and gunner. The LaGOWE was designed from the start to carry beam weapons, but ZAFT has had difficulty perfecting this technology, and it wasn`t until the capture of the Earth Alliance`s prototype Gundams that the development of the LaGOWE was successfully completed. This mobile suit is now in the pre-production stage, and is presently assigned only to commanders like Andrew Waltfeld.",
