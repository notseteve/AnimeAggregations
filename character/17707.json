  "description" : "Don Patch is a happy-go-lucky character, more so than anyone else on Bo-bobo`s team. While facing extreme danger and the many powerful and troublesome threats in this world, he usually keeps his chin up and either finds or says something that completely destroys the mood of the battle or makes things even more bizarre. Most of his cheerfulness comes from his hajike way of life, where he must always be doing something bizarre or else he`ll be completely uncontrollable. Even during the most serious times, Don Patch can never take anything too seriously.",
