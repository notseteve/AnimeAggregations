  "description" : "As Princess of the Demon World, Gurenda is fiercely competitive. She immediately butts heads with Yuushi, her rival to become the Platinum Princess. Gurenda is a braggart who frequently proclaims herself as \"fantastic\" and \"elegant,\" and is also often selfish, jealous, and temperamental. But she has a sweet side which she tries to hide, and eventually becomes very close friends with Yuushi (perhaps, even overly-protective of her), even though she`s loathe to admit it. Is seventeen, but like the others, has the body of a ten-year-old, although she looks rather developed.",
