  "description" : "The supremely self-confident pilot of the Ranpu-class fighter assigned to the http://anidb.net/ch7063 [Soyokaze]. Known alternately as \"The Samurai of Space\" and \"The Shoot-Down King,\" Kojirou graduated with honors from flight training. While he hasn`t logged that many hours of flight time, he shows deadly skill against the Raalgon forces.\nPossessing an actual phobia of women, he seems to regard the Hanner sisters as a special case, no doubt owing to their own natural piloting skill. He keeps a small mascot doll the twins made for him in the cockpit of his fighter. He also gets along very poorly with the Marines.",
