  "description" : "Kevin Yeegar was the oldest of the Generals. Being a former school teacher, he felt compassionate for those that followed under him. However, it also gives him painful memories of his life as a teacher.\nIn one incident, one of his student was killed in an accident. This causes another student to grieve for her, however turning her into an http://anidb.net/t6684 [Akuma]. As he wasn`t an Exorcist then, he could not kill the Akuma, which led to a massacre of all his students. He became an Exorcist in the wake of this incident. Later, he was attacked then crucified facing the cross by http://anidb.net/ch7370 [Tyki Mikk], dying shortly after the http://anidb.net/ch32498 [Black Order] recovered his body.\nYeegar`s Equipment-type anti-Akuma weapon is a pair of chained pendulums that can split into multiple smaller pendulums, allowing him to attack many Akuma at once. His Innocence was eventually destroyed by the http://anidb.net/ch9471 [Millennium Earl].\nSource: Wikipedia",
