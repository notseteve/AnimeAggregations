  "description" : "Kenyan`s Blitzle battled Ash`s Oshawott in a field near Raimon City. Kenyan initially was surprised that Ash used a Water type against his Blitzle which is an Electric type but he soon realized that Ash`s Oshawott uses it`s Scallsword as a defense to reflect electric attacks. Kenyan`s Blitzle used other attacks to counter Ash`s Oshawott`s electric defense and its Double Kick managed to knock Ash`s Oshawott`s Scallsword out of its hands and far away into the forest. Ash`s Oshawott quickly stopped the battle to go after its Scallsword.\nLater on, Kenyan`s Blitzle battled once again with Ash`s Oshawott even though it didn`t have its Scallsword. Cilan`s Dwebble fashioned a new Scallsword for Ash`s Oshawott out a rock but during the battle, Kenyan`s Blitzle`s Double Kick managed to destroy it leaving Ash`s Oshawott somewhat defenseless. Even though Ash`s Oshawott had lost its Scallsword, Kenyan`s Blitzle still ended up loosing to Ash`s Oshawott after the two of them crashed into a big rock. Kenyan`s Blitzle was knocked out but Ash`s Oshawott managed to get up.",
