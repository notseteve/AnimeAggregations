  "description" : "Hattori is a notable man in Nearby Town, who was seeking excellent Pokémon Sommeliers and he wanted Cilan to come for a visit to find out which Pokémon had the best compatibility for his daughter Momotchi. He has fairly large estate that is walled and gated so it doesn`t allow anyone unwanted on his property. He is obviously a very rich person as he has an expensive car and can afford a personal butler.\nHattori suggested that Cilan and Pinot Noir have a Pokémon battle to determine which A-class Pokémon Sommelier would get to choose the Pokémon for Momotchi. He seemed very excited to get to see a battle between two A-class Pokémon Sommeliers in his own backyard. He seemed to favor Pinot Noir`s choice of Tuline and hoped that Pinot Noir would win the battle. After Cilan won the battle and explained why Tamagetake was the best choice for his daughter, Hattori apologized to his daughter and allowed her to be best friends with the Tamagetake.",
