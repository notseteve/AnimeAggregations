  "description" : "The Innovators are a group formed by Ribbons Almark and living bio-terminals to Veda. Supposedly essential to Aeolia`s plan, Ribbons claims that they are \"the future of mankind\". Considered to be existences that surpass normal humans, they are beings created through means of heavy gene manipulation and nanotechnology by Celestial Being scientists. They are characterized by their advanced ability to use quantum brainwaves and directly interface with Veda, as well as their agelessness and androgyny (mixed male/female characteristics). Though Innovators is a group name, it`s also considered a classification of different human type as Tieria Erde is also technically a Innovator, but sided with Celestial Being. Innovators created through artificial means are actually revealed to be Innovades, false Innovators created to help guide humanity towards true innovation; The only original Innovades seem to be Ribbons Almark, Tieria Erde, and Hixar Fermi; The rest having been created by Ribbons. There may be more unknown Innovades created in Celestial Being`s past.",
