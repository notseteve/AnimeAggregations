  "description" : "Menace was a princess from the ancient Egyptian-themed Amara Kingdom. She once lived a life of luxury until she was betrayed by Anarista, her most trusted adviser, and died trapped in her palace as her kingdom fell into ruin. Four thousand years later, the powerful Swamp Witch resurrected her to become part of her army. However, Menace broke free from the witch`s command and sets out on her own to restore the Amara Kingdom. She has a talking scepter named Setora, who does her bidding. As a result from her resurrection by the Witch, she acquired a \"cursing power\", black flames that she can summon from her fists to weaken her foes, with which she once hit Melona when she took Anarista`s form to tease her.\nSource: Wiki",
