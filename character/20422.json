  "description" : "Lady Flynn Gilbit assumed the role of her husband Lord Norman Gilbit to protect her small country, Caloria, and its lands after his death. She chose to wear a mask and pretend to be her husband because Small Shimaron had conquered Caloria and, under their laws, women cannot inherit lands or titles, and adoptions are only valid before the death of the husband. Upon discovering that Big Shimaron has one of the Forbidden boxes (\"The End of the Wind\"), she assists Yuuri and his group in retrieving it.\nThe original rulers of Caloria were the Wincott family, and because of Flynn`s ancestors, the Wincott family was forcefully removed from rule. Due to this incident, Flynn is troubled when Julia`s father, Lord Odell von Wincott, visits Blood Pledge castle on Yuuri`s request.",
