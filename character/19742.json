His team is defeated and disbanded and he continues to support Ikki afterwards. Inuyama is a close friend of Gonzou, and he wears a helmet shaped like the head of a Doberman dog. He slams his opponents with the tip of his helmet (or sometimes just with his impossibly hard hair), doing surprisingly major damage.",
