  "description" : "Miyamasu Yoshinori is known as the sixth man for Kainan. His unimposing presence (by comparison, he is 5 cm shorter and 10 kg lighter than Hikoichi Aida) distracts opponents from his real basketball skills, especially his reliable 3 point shooting, the accuracy of which is comparable to Jin`s and Mitsui`s 3 point shooting. Though he has to wear glasses, when called to play, he replaces them with a pair of goggles.\nSource: wikipedia",
