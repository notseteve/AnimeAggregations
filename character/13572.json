  "description" : "Botan is Kyou`s pet baby boar, and is a comic relief character. Botan will sometimes go to Kyou`s school just to see her. Due to its small size and the fact that it is a baby boar, it is sometimes captured by several characters who talk of eating it. Botan hates Ryou because it mistook Ryou for trying to eat it when she took it for a warm bath. In the After Story, Botan has become an adult boar, but still acts the same. Botan has seven different skills, told him by Kyou, one of them being able to take the appearance of a stuffed animal by being extremely still. Another skill is called \"Rugby Ball\" in which Botan shrinks his legs until he resembles a ball, allowing Kyou to use him as a projectile. These skills are considered to be animal cruelty by Tomoya. Two other skills are mentioned in the visual novel, but never shown, called \"massager\" and \"pillow\".",
