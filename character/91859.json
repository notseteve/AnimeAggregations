  "description" : "The Bubblehead is the tallest of the group and seemingly oldest, a strong man with a misshapen skull. His weapon of choice is a chain with a set of razor sharp jaws on the end. Turned like the others into a spawn.\nAs an apostle spawn, he gained the common feature of enhanced strength, speed, stamina and angelic wings. He also gained an increased stamina beyond his comrades, evident when http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] cuts his right arm off and he did not seem to notice or care.\nHe was seen one last time as http://anidb.net/ch33056 [God Hand] http://anidb.net/ch2046 [Slan]`s shadow vessel.",
