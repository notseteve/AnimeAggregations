When they refused to tell Jiraiya any information on Pain, even after tickle torture on his partner, he transformed Yuudachi into a frog, which frightened Ryuusui into divulging information about Pain. Jiraiya then tries to control Ryuusui in an attempt to find Pain, but is found by http://anidb.net/ch11994 [Konan]. Ryuusui then follows Konan`s orders to leave and is able to escape.",
