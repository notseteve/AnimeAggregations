Although E-102 Gamma was created by and made to work under the orders of Dr. Eggman without question, which involved assisting in empowering the mystical water elemental Chaos, he eventually turned against his maker`s will, and devoted his short existence to freeing the animals contained in the other E-100 units.\n(Source: Sonic Wikia)",
