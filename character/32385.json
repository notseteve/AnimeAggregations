  "description" : "Maruyama Madoka is No.4 of the Muto-assassination team. Maruyama is a bishounen that is usually under the disguise of a fat, chubby ball, until Tokiko cut open the disguise with her Valkyrie Skirt. He was able to shrink Tokiko to 34 cm in their first battle, then seemingly shrink her to nothing in their second battle, only to find Tokiko still has 4 cm remaining and went into his stomach. He was defeated as his guts were ripped out by Valkyrie Skirt. His special ability is that he can draw a circle without using a compass. In the anime, he, Inukai, Chitose, Busujima and Shusui were sent to fight Victor, but lost against Victor`s Buso Renkin, Fatal Attraction, and was forced to retreat. He does not use his fat man disguise in the anime either. He is a homosexual, as he is listed as liking feminine activities like day spas and make-up, and also dislikes women.",
