  "description" : "The main protagonist in the story. He has a nice, helping personality and is not afraid to help girls in need. His two close friends are Takamizo Hachisuke, and Watarase Jun, who seems to have a crush on him. When he was younger he was able to do some magic in order to help Haruhi who was being bullied, but now he professes that he cannot use magic (though in reality he still can). Additionally, he seems to be put off by the notion of using magic whatsoever, even if it is able to help people. Eventually, he realizes that magic can bring happiness if used in the right way and transfers to the magic section.\nIn the end, he learned that his real mother is Minagi Suzuri (a teacher in the magic section). He is actually one of a kind and one of the most powerful and quickest of learners when it comes to magic, although he doesn`t use it because of a few accidents when he was younger and because his mother taught him not to use magic since he was young.",
