  "description" : "0 Raiser is a mobile weapons support craft to support specifically GN-0000 00 Gundam. It`s design is a cross between GN Arms and GNR-000 GN Sefer. 0 Raiser is a weapons support fighter that can detach and combine with 00 Gundam. The binders can attach upon 00 Gundam`s Twin GN Drive shoulder attachments while the main body attaches to the back of 00 Gundam. When combined they become a single combat unit, 00 (Double O) Raiser.\n0 Raiser uses large GN Condenser as its main power source and is designed to charge using 00`s GN Particles when docked. It can be used in combat independently or when docked, and also stabilizes 00`s Twin Drive System. 0 Raiser is loosely autonomous with the aid of a Haro unit, capable of assisting 00 Gundam in combat and docking sequence; the unit has a cockpit for manual pilot control. When combined with 0 Raiser (through a laser guided docking sequence), the Twin Drive System is stabilized, and Trans-Am is fully operational.",
