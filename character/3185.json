  "description" : "The protagonist. A student of Shuuhou Seiha Private School, ranked Fukushou (second-in-command) of the girl`s kendo club and in line for a large inheritance. Naeka presents a unique challenge to Kogarashi; though attractive and extremely busty for her age, Naeka speaks of walking the \"path of the sword\" like a warrior mainly to escape from her failed traumatic attempt at love where she accidentally poisoned her crush with a home cooked bento. She is independent, stubborn, can be a lethal cook, not too bright and coarsely speaks her mind. Naeka suffers both friends and enemies for her figure and manners, and has to tolerate the demanding \"service\" of Kogarashi -- but through it all, she can still be upbeat and positive.",
