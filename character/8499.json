  "description" : "Alice is friends with http://anidb.net/ch1286 [Akari] and http://anidb.net/ch8498 [Aika], the Undines of http://anidb.net/ch7786 [Aria] and http://anidb.net/ch125951 [Himeya], respectively. She`s an apprentice of one of the http://anidb.net/ch125950 [Orange Planet]`s Primas - http://anidb.net/ch8506 [Athena] - and has to split her time into going to school and rowing training. Although being only a Pair, her skill surpasses both Akari and Aika`s. They practice together despite working for rival companies.\nAt the beginning, she is introverted and anti-social, but she lightens up as the series progresses. She often uses dekkai (でっかい, \"huge\") as an intensifier.\nAlice is the first Undine to be promoted straight from Pair to Prima, skipping the middle \"level\". She is promoted first out of three; Akari and Aika were Singles at that time. Alice received the title \"Orange Princess\" (黄昏の姫君[オレンジ・プリンセス], Tasogare no Himegimi, lit. \"Twilight Princess\") upon her promotion. She sang the song http://anidb.net/s10336 [Lumis Eterne] during her Prima Undine exam.",
