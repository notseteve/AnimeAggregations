  "description" : "Yoshino Asami is a 17 year old Majima Academy student and Keima`s classmate. A very quiet girl, in class she is usually seen reading a book alone and does not actively interact with the other classmates. From the start of the story, she already had an interest in Keima and was always looking at him whenever she wasn`t reading.\nDifferent to her sister, she is not good at socialising with people. Trying to overcome that problem of hers, she joins the tea ceremony club. Even though she always participates in the activities, she still has problems when talking to people. She even feels like puking when she talks with them too much. She can talk normally with her family members though.\nHer sister, Yoshino Ikumi, tries to help deepen her relationship with Keima by disquising as Asami and interacting with him. But in the end, Keima finds out, though he agrees to deepen the relationship between him and Asami.\nHer name is derived from Yoshino Station (吉野駅, Yoshino-eki).\nAsami is shown as a background character in the Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai anime adaptation during Chihiro`s arc.",
