  "description" : "This prototype mobile suit was developed by the Titans at the Gryps space colony. Based on the legendary RX-78 Gundam, the Mk.II inherits its predecessor`s high performance and remarkable potential, although it suffers from a few lingering design flaws - notably, its obsolete armour materials. On the other hand, the Mk.II also introduces the radical new movable frame design concept, giving it superb manoeuvrability. All three prototype units are captured by the AEUG resistance group during their raid on the Titans` headquarters. The rebels keep one in service, replacing its sinister Titans colours with a more heroic white and blue scheme, and eagerly dissect the other two in order to learn their technological secrets.",
