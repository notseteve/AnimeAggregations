  "description" : "Buster Machine 3 is a superweapon developed by humanity during the war with the Space Monsters and designed to destroy their command brain at the center of the galaxy. Also known as the \"Black Hole Bomb\", it was a gigantic bomb formed by compressing the planet Jupiter into approximately 1/30000th its normal size and then triggering a chain reaction to create a black hole, and used 3000 slave units placed at a 10,000 light-year radius around the center of the Milky Way galaxy to enhance its destructive power. The bomb`s shell was made with the entirety of Australia`s landmass. It was constructed in 15 years since the initiation of the final campaign to the galactic core to destroy the Space Monsters. It was capable of warp jumps and was equipped with a barrier generator which was capable of withstanding barrages from Generation 5 ships such as the Eltreum.",
