After an attack upon the http://anidb.net/ch21733 [SFD-1 Macross] by Zentradi forces, http://anidb.net/ch7654 [Ichijou Hikaru] and http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Lynn Minmay] were trapped inside a damaged section of the ship. After they were rescued, http://anidb.net/ch7418 [Minmay] drove off in an A510 Car, driven by her cousin http://anidb.net/ch10513 [Kaifun]. A popular and stylish vehicle, the lasting influence of the A510 can be seen in personal vehicles made in following decades. Most notably, the influence of the A510 can be seen during the late 2030`s and early 2040`s when several different cars and even motorcycles appeared, taking obvious design lineage from this stylish vehicle.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macrossdyrl/a510car.htm",
