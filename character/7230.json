  "description" : "Uma is a witch, although she is not yet adept at spell casting. She has a happy personality and finds joy in exploring the human world. When she makes a discovery about the world she quickly and proudly points it out to the other girls, however she is generally the last to discover such things and becomes disappointed when others learn faster than she does. Her overall design is reminiscent of a bunny-girl.",
