  "description" : "Sahara Miori is Aya`s distant cousin and a C-Genomer from Shizuoka Prefecture. She is an ordinary high-school girl living a normal happy life with her mother. Her mother was summoned by the Mikages and was killed at the main house when Aya first transformed into Ceres. When Aya comes to a new school the two meet and become friends. Although Aya doesn`t know about her personally, Miori is only pretending and has an agenda of her own. She transformed into a tennyo to take on Aya (as Ceres) to avenge her mother`s death. She later committed suicide as her final act of \"revenge\" against Aya. Miori is identified by the Mikage scientists as possessing the same tennyo type as Aya.",
