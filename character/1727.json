  "description" : "A very powerful, battle-dedicated Stand: all its powers are destructive in nature or assist him in battle. In appearance, it looks like a thin, robotic humanoid clad in medieval armour, armed with a rapier. Silver Chariot is an incredibly agile Stand, able to attack enemies with barrages of sword slashes and thrusts before the opponent can react. It can also use this agility, along with its sword, to defend and deflect attacks aimed at it (he has been able to slash fire attacks from Abdul away from him without any harm). If necessary, Polnareff can also shed Silver Chariot`s armour away, exposing its robotic form. In this form, Silver Chariot is even faster, to the point it can actually move fast enough to create doubles of itself. These doubles are not illusory: the Stand is moving at faster-than-the-eye-can-see speed between different positions. As such, were all the doubles to attack at once, it`d mean that the Stand is attacking from all those positions simultaneously, giving it incredible destructive power. Similarly, because of this same speed, attacking the doubles would be futile, as the Stand can easily move away before being harmed. Polnareff`s `secret attack` is called `shooting the sword`, in which the blade of his sword detaches at high speed. He uses this only when it is certain it will it strike, because the blade has to be reattached before Silver Chariot can be fight effectively again.",
