  "description" : "One of the most popular boys at Seika High, Usui appears to take little interest in anything and prefers to observe things as they unfold, though proves to be extraordinarily talented in numerous areas. He develops an interest in Misaki and is the first to learn she is working at a maid caf√©, but chooses to keep her secret and soon falls in love with her. While she dismisses his behavior simply as harassment, he continues to watch over and protect her, as well as offering insightful advice on how to deal with the boys at Seika effectively and fairly. He appears to be the only male student at school that Misaki is willing to speak to as an equal. Little is known about Usui`s background and he is reluctant to speak about it, though he reveals a willingness to tell Misaki. He has an older brother and lives alone in an apartment.\nHe`s a pro in cooking, can play chess, is smart, jumps down roofs (but doesn`t die), free all the time and always appears unexpectedly.",
