  "description" : "Leila is a teacher at a nursery school in East Isshu. She was taking a walk with some of the Pok√©mon from the school when she had to search for Elphoon after it got blown away by the wind. As a result, I got separated from Washibon and Valchai.\nLeila has the tendency to be a bit clumsy and is always tripping and falling on the ground. She`s doing her best, but she has a slightly thoughtless side to her. She admitted that she was still inexperienced and can`t even take proper care of everyone but she managed to gain the respect of both Washibon and Valchai. Despite only being their teacher for a short while, Washibon and Valchai loved her and were vying for her attention were stubbornly fighting each other but resolved some of their differences as Cilan suggested they had begun to get along with each other and Leila.",
