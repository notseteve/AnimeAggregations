  "description" : "Rena is an elf living in the mortal world. Her place in this world is jeopardized by the weakening of El, the power gems that energize everything including the connection to her home world. If this power fades, the ties that bind the two planes will vanish, as will Rena herself. She joined the El search party and uses her abilities as a ranger to protect the El and her friends. As an elven warrior, she excels both at melee combat and archery, and can also combine both techniques.\nSource: Wikipedia",
