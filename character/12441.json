  "description" : "The temporarily homeroom teacher for Sawako`s class, taking over when the previous homeroom teacher became sick during the summer holidays while Sawako was helping him. He is nicknamed Pin and always is called that way, except Sawako who obeys the formalities and still calls him Arai-sensei. Pin is a great fan of baseball as well as the school baseball team`s coach. He used to be part of Kazehaya`s father`s league team, so he has known Shouta since when he was young. A loud and eccentric man prone to believing the silliest things, Pin apparently enjoys interrupting people. He had nicknamed the puppy that Sawako and Kazehaya found by the river \"Pedro Martinez\" after the legendary baseball pitcher.",
