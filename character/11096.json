  "description" : "The Gouf is a new land warfare mobile suit, based on the Zaku II. Anticipating the appearance of Federation mobile suits, its designers gave the Gouf a variety of melee weapons - built-in finger machine guns, a defensive shield, and an electrified whip known as a \"heat rod.\" The Gouf also has stronger armour and higher mobility than the Zaku II, making it a formidable close-combat machine. In the hands of a master pilot like Lieutenant Ramba Ral, this sinister-looking mobile suit is capable of duelling even the mighty Gundam.",
