  "description" : "Touya is Minori`s twin brother. His class is \"Samurai\", capable of using heavy armor and weaponry and casting special spells to increase his performance that must be used with caution due to their long cooldown time. When Touya and his sister first met Shiroe, Touya immediately started pestering him with questions on how to gain skills. He views Shiroe as a role model due to not only his strength and knowledge, but also his cool and kind personality. While Minori is shy and gentle, Touya is very brash but it is clear he cares for his sister greatly and genuinely. Wheelchair-bound after an accident in the old world, he greatly enjoys being able to use his legs again in the world of Elder Tale. When Touya and his sister were trapped in the unethical guild Hamelin, he often wondered what Shiroe would do in that situation and tries to emulate Shiroe when faced with challenges. Once rescued by Shiroe and his friends, Touya joins Log Horizon with his sister.\nSource: Wiki",
