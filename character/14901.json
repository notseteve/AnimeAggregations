  "description" : "Agito is a third-year student at the same high school the others attend. He almost never allows sentiment to stand in his way. He doesn`t even show much expression in his face, but acts quite friendly at school. He finds a Guyver unit and merges with it to become \"Guyver III.\" Agito also seems to have extensive knowledge on the Guyver and its abilities and exhibits them quite well. Agito seems to have his own agenda when it comes to dealing with Chronos. He is an excellent example of an anti-hero.",
