One night while he was sleeping, the egg hatched into a Riolu. It jumped through the bedroom window and began fighting wild Pokémon in the area. It kept getting beat up and then it faced an Onix but Ash Ketchum arrived to help him battle the Onix which then caused the Onix to flee the battle.\nAfter being fixed up by Nurse Joy, they all recognized it was a pretty stubborn Pokémon but it indicated that it wanted to be caught by Ash Ketchum. He threw a Poké Ball and was quickly caught.\nAsh`s Lucario is the evolved form of Ash`s Riolu.
