  "description" : "Huntail went mostly unnoticed because it lives at extreme depths of the sea. Huntail`s body is built to withstand the adverse living conditions in the deep sea that challenge even the best-made human craft. The water pressure is high enough to be labeled crushing, but Huntail withstands it by having a body with a very thick and sturdy spine. Its eyes are suited for life far under the sea as well; they can see clearly even in the murky dark depths of the ocean. Huntail carries bioluminescence, which it uses when hunting prey. It lights up the eye-like textures on its tail and wiggles it to deceive prey into thinking they have found a fish to eat. Then Huntail attacks and attempts to swallow the prey whole with its gaping mouth. It prefers smaller prey since its body and stomach are rather thin.",
