  "description" : "Nanami is another loyal righthand of Dan Morihiko. He`s very skilled in the art of disguise, and is often ordered by Dan to watch Class Q in cases by disguising as one of the suspects. Nanami`s very carefree, as he loves to show his new tricks (which Ryuu despises) to Class Q, but he can be extremely serious when he needs to be. His favourite disguise is that of a cactus, which is also occasionally accompanied by a flashy, brightly patterned sombrero or Mexican outfit. This usually appears when he is under stress, such as when he had to take Dan-sensei`s place as head of DDS during Dan-sensei`s hospital stay.\nSource: Wiki",
