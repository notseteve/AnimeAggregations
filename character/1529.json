  "description" : "Shirow Watari is the director of TERRA, and spends a lot of time on the road facing the press, lobbying for the organization, and coordinating with the BÃ¤hbem Foundation. Though his public persona is as stern and serious as that of his friend Jin Kunugi, he is more cheerful around the other TERRA employees; the souvenirs he buys for the employees is a running joke in the series.\nWatari was the assistant of Professor Rikudoh, and they found Quon and Maya together. Shirow Kamina eventually married Maya, but he changed his family name to Watari after Maya had gone over to the Mu. Watari is the biological father of Ayato and Itsuki. Although hesitant to meet Ayato, during his first meeting he subtly alludes to their relationship but is completely ignored.",
