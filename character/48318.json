  "description" : "Jeremy is Cynthia`s butler and chauffeur and he lives and looks over her villa in Sazanami Town in East Isshu. Cynthia usually spent her long vacations at the villa and Jeremy makes sure everything is well for her and her guests. He also looks after her boat and drives it to other islands in the area.\nAs expected from a person who is a bulter, he is well mannered and proper in his dealing with people. When issues arise like when Team Rocket attacked just outside the villa, he does his best to inform people like Cynthia of the problem. He is a very humble yet well respected person in the community as well.",
