  "description" : "Midori no Esmeraude is the second of the Black Moon Clan to appear. She is a selfish and vain woman who tries to emanate a goddess-like appearance by wearing an elegant, tight-fitting dress along with opera-length gloves and knee-high stiletto boots. She has a distinctive laugh, loud and piercing, and is the most comedic member of the Black Moon. She is infatuated with Prince Demand, who is obsessed with Sailor Moon.\nSouce: Wikipedia",
