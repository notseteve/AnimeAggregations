  "description" : "Kingler is a Water-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I.\nIt evolves from Krabby starting at level 28. It also has a Gigantamax form.\nKingler is a crustacean Pokémon resembling a crab. Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler`s entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler`s main feature is its red pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and hard as steel.\nKingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. It its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While Kingler`s large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around. In the past, Crabhammer was its signature move.\nGigantamax Kingler is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move G-Max Foam Burst.",
