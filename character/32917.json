  "description" : "Shinobu is Mikoto`s sister, but unlike her more of a practitioner of Bushido than a kunoichi, who first appears in episode eighteen of the anime. After her first meeting with Ikuto and Suzu, she determines that Ikuto is troubling Mikoto and decides to challenge him to a duel, much to his reluctance. Despite being a ninja, she is a bit on the clumsy side (she trips on her own sword, then later stumbles off the edge of a cliff), and has a horrible sense of direction. Takes many things as training when actually when it has little to do with training in the long run. After Ikuto unexpectedly defeats her in a match, to his exasperation, she decides to become his apprentice. It is hinted that she has feelings for Ikuto but, like Suzu, she lacks experience with the opposite sex. She ends her sentences with the phrase \"-de gozaru\", similar to the phrase \"-desu\" but in an archaic form used by samurais in the past.",
