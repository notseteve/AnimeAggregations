The body is customized from the mass-produced HMX-16 `Leon`. Ilfa proposes to work at Sango and Ruri`s house during her testing phase which angers Ruri because she takes all her jobs. Even though she is hated by Ruri, Ilfa loves her because Ruri is the one who shows her that the outside world is not frightening. In the anime OVA, Ilfa is asked to serve at Yuuji`s house because he has a maid gynoid fetish which becomes a learning experience for her thanks to Tamaki.",
