  "description" : "Henrietta is a Bard and one of the leaders of the Crescent Moon Alliance. Although she seems stern and put together, she can be just as eccentric as Marielle when she sees something cute, as evident when she met Akatsuki. Her real name is \"Umeko\" according to Marielle. She is an accountant in real life and is a great asset to Shiroe`s plans due to her ability to negotiate with others, but it is not known whether her skills at cosplay in Log Horizon are the same in the old world. Her closeness to Shiroe eventually leads Henrietta to get herself attracted to him as well.\nSource: Wiki",
