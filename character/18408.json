  "description" : "Lau is a Chinese noble, President of the British Branch of a Chinese trading company, and friend to the Phantomhive family. He is also part of the Shanghai Mafia and runs an opium den. He is always smiling and his eyes are always closed except for brief moments in episodes fifteen and twenty. Lau often agrees to things before learning what is happening and jumps into conversations with helpful information only to later state he has no idea. He is also unaware his antics appear strange to others. However, he can be very coldblooded and cryptic and is willing to go further than Ciel would, such as having Lord West and his wife killed because he knew they`d try to cheat again. He is often seen with his personal assassin Ran-Mao, a Chinese, doll-like girl referred to as his sister, although not by blood. Although she very rarely speaks and is portrayed as emotionless, she is very loyal to him. In the anime adaption, Lau and Ran-mao are defeated by Ciel and Sebastian after they use the Earl`s company to store and sell Lady Blanc opium in the guise of candy. Lau and Ran-mao then throw themselves into the River Thames.",
