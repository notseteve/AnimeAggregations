  "description" : "Sunkern are small, yellow-and-brown creatures with green leaves protruding from their heads. Sunkern`s entire life is centered around its evolution into a Sunflora. It moves as little as possible, trying to preserve the energy and nutrients it requires for the evolution process. According to the Pok√©dex, Sunkern`s diet is said only to be morning dew, which collects under the leaves of plants beneath it. The natural enemy of a Sunkern is Spearow as their only form of protection is shaking their leafy heads.",
