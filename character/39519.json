  "description" : "Wardes is Captain of Tristain`s Griffin Knights and is Louise`s former fiancé. He is a highly skilled swordsman as well as a mage. He is later revealed to be evil as he betrayed Louise and attempts to mind control her into marrying him. Both the novel and anime imply that he is aware of Louise`s potential as a Void Mage and interested in her primarily for that reason. He kills the Prince of Albion when his attempt is revealed and even attacks Louise earning him Saito`s fury who retaliates by slicing off one of his hands.\nWardes is a member of Reconquista and was the masked man who hunted Louise and Saito during Albion`s civil war and the one that freed Fouqet. Saito and Wardes reached a stalemate when fighting during the war.\nSource: wiki\n[i]He appears to be named for François-René Crespin du Bec, Marquis de Vardes (1620-1688), a scheming noble in the courts of both Louis XIII and XIV, and the historical basis for similarly-named antagonists in Alexandre Dumas` d`Artagnan Romances.[/I]",
