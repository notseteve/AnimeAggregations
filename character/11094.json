  "description" : "The Zaku II is the Principality of Zeon`s standard mass-produced mobile suit. Its manoeuvrability and heavy weaponry make it more than a match for the Earth Federation`s conventional forces. At the start of the war, Zeon`s Zakus wiped out the Earth Federation`s space fleet and overran two-thirds of the planet`s surface, and over the following months the Zaku II has been adapted into several variants for space, land, and even underwater combat. However, it proves to be hopelessly outclassed by the Federation`s prototype mobile suits, and Zeon`s developers begin phasing out the classic Zaku in favor of newer mobile suit designs.",
