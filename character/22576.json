  "description" : "Pete Pebbleman is a Pokémon Trainer who hails from Pewter City.\nMaking it to the third round of the Kanto Pokémon League, Pete was pitched against Ash Ketchum on the Ice field.\nAfter Both Pete and Ash lost one Pokémon each it would be Ash`s Kingler versus Pete`s Cloyster and the winner would take the advantage in the battle.\nThey both approached each other slowly before Ash order Kingler to use a crabhammer to which Pete ordered his cloyers to withdraw into its shell. Despite Cloyster being withdrawn in its shell Kingler kept on using its crabhammer attack\nWith Pete at a disadvantage in the third round battle in the Kanto Pokémon League he turned to his Arcanine to make a comeback. Pete`s choice of Pokémon came to a suprise to some people as the battle was taking place on the ice field. After creating some space for itself Pete ordered Arcanine to use a Dragon Rage attack which clearly dazed Kingler and forced Ash to switch to Pikachu.\nJust like Pete`s Arcanine, Pikachu proved to be agile on the ice and managed to dodge Arcanine`s Fire Blast attack. In an attempt to slow Pikachu down, Pete order Arcanine to melt the ice field which turned it into a pool of water\nArcanine fired one last Fire Blast at Pikachu which it dodged by jumping into the newly formed pool. Ash ordered Pikachu to use Thunderbolt which electrified the pool and Arcanine who was standing on the final piece of ice. Arcanine fell into the pool and fainted, giving the round three victory to Ash.",
