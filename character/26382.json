  "description" : "Takemoto Suzue is a high-school student (although she pretends to be a college student when dating boys). She takes lessons in traditional Japanese dance, and on one occasion performs a hula dance on stage to http://anidb.net/ch26380 [Yasuna]`s music but her true side job is modeling (much to the displeasure of http://anidb.net/ch26431 [her father]).\nDuring the \"foursome date\" arranged by http://anidb.net/ch26381 [Kazuki] she immediately gets interested in http://anidb.net/ch26379 [Hirosuke], and despite being aware of the boy having fallen for Yasuna (whose name name he learned only from Suzue as both girls attend the same school) she repeatedly asks Hirosuke out.\nActually her relation to Hirosuke has some history: When they were children the boy caught her rabbits that she let escape and brought them back to her. But Hirosuke doesn`t even remember that they are childhood friends.",
