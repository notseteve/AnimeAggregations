  "description" : "Gurd is the smallest and least powerful member of the \"Ginyu Force\" physically; a short, rotund, and green alien with four eyes (which prevents him from wearing a scouter like the other members). Though clearly the weakest member of the group, Gurd possesses some psychic abilities, including being able to stop time for as long as he can hold his breath. This seems to be one of the primary reasons he has attained membership to the \"Ginyu Force\".",
