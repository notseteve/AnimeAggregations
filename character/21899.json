She is weak to compliments and flattery. Her three sizes are 87, 59, and 88.\nShe encountered the Hiryuu Kai and Hagane after her father was killed in combat. She ends up joining them since she`s not happy with what the DC has become, since she knows it wasn`t what her father wanted. She falls in love with Masaki, though he doesn`t feel the same way. She`s always trying to get him to compliment her.\nAfter the war with the Aerogators, Ryuune recieved a request from Guilliam to accompany him into the Aerogators space fortress, Neviim, which was currently being held under the federations jurisdiction.\nHer father created the Valsione for her after she stated that she disliked the Valsion`s design.",
