  "description" : "The first homeroom teacher of the Ishiyama class at St. Ishiyama prior to Saotome`s arrival. Bespectacled, and at first overconfident on his ability to exert control over the thugs, he quickly fails to do so, when his attempts to intimidate them by means of authority, strength or coercion backfire badly. He later becomes attached to the group and supports them in the volleyball match, and is greatly disappointed to be replaced by Saotome.",
