Most of the younger officers in the station look up to him as a mentor whenever they need help or advise from him. Like Kachou, Natsumi was infatuated with him since she liked older men before meeting with Shoji[10]. Tokuno is partnered up with a younger detective named Sugihara when attending to cases in the field. Like Kachou, he appears to be lenient with most of the officers in their capacity to be good officers in their speciality.\nHe uses a Honda Legend as his personal police vehicle whenever he is conducting detective work.",
