Franky and followers were originally introduced as antagonists of the Water 7 Arc against the Straw Hats until circumstances forced them to become allies. Per the request of the Franky Family, Franky was allowed to join the Straw Hats to fulfill his dream. He is the eighth member of the Straw Hat crew and the seventh to join http://anidb.net/ch474 [Luffy]`s crew. He is also the second member to have been a former villain (the first being http://anidb.net/ch488 [Nico Robin]).",
