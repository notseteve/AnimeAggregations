  "description" : "This AEUG intelligence operative is a tough, daring spy with nerves of steel and a photographic memory. As warm and generous as she is tough and independent, Reccoa serves as a mentor to AEUG newcomers and a valued adviser to its core leadership. However, she has a streak of restlessness that causes her to seek out dangerous missions, such as scouting out the Federation`s Jaburo base in advance of the AEUG`s full-scale assault.",
