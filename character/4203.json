  "description" : "A high Tera Guardian of the German High-Council. He prides himself on his unparalleled combat skills that single him out from the many high Tera Guardians employed at \"The Noble One.\" He also possesses nerves of steel, those don`t prevent him from getting his personal feelings mixed up in his duties. His \"Exceed: Stampede\" splits his body into four clones with equal mass and power to attack the enemy. Though the clones follow the command of the original body, they can also judge the situation of the fight autonomously.",
