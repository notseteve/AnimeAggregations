  "description" : "Weavile, known as the Sharp Claw Pokémon, takes on the appearance of a black, bipedal, weasel-like warrior garbed in a red crown and a red collar. Weavile have three claws on each paw, instead of two like its pre-evolved form, Sneasel. A female Weavile has smaller ears than a male one. Weavile are known to travel and live in mating pairs and are very mischievous. They are also known to travel in larger groups as well of about four to five individuals, living in cold climates and hunting prey with impressive coordination. They convey messages to others by scratching odd symbols in ice or on the bark of trees. They made their first appearance in the 8th movie, Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Sneasel evolves into Weavile when it levels up at night while holding the Razor Claw item.",
