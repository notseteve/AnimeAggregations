  "description" : "Calcifer is a fire demon from Diana Wynne Jones` 1986 novel Howl`s Moving Castle. He is described as \"a thin blue face, very long and thin, with a thin blue nose\" and curly green flames as hair. He has purple fire for his mouth, two green flames for eyebrows, and orange flame for his eyes. In the movie, he is a teardrop shaped orange flame, but in the scene where Howl moves the castle, Calcifer flares up and looks somewhat like his description in the book. In House of Many Ways, Calcifer is described as a blue teardrop. However, in the Japanese animated film adaption, Calcifer appears to be an adorable orange flame.",
