The explosions can occur remotely as he often prepares handprints before activating his ability. He uses this to cause attacks on the embassies in Tokyo. His remuneration is drinking hot milk. Maki seems to be infatuated with http://anidb.net/ch10555 [Amber] and says he would do anything for her. He attempts to kill http://anidb.net/ch7571 [Hei] out of jealousy, after learning Hei is the \"him\" that Amber frequently spoke of, convinced that he (Maki) is the only one fit of her love. He is killed by http://anidb.net/ch10554 [November 11].",
