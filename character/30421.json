Touma and Itsuwa encountered him when they went to France. He uses the spell Execution of Light, which can manipulate the hierarchy of everything around him. He also uses a guillotine made of flour, a byproduct of the Execution of Light spell. It seems that he knew something about Touma`s Imagine Breaker, but it was never revealed. He also learns of his memory loss during a fight with him. He is later killed by Acqua near the end of the 14th novel.",
