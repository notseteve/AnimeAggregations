  "description" : "Butch and Cassidy attached Drowzee to a device that would amplify Drowzee`s hypnotic waves and broadcasts it through a parabolic antenna on the roof of their base. Drowzee would then use the attack to round up Pokémon by telling them to come to Butch and Cassidy`s base on Mandarin Island. Drowzee could also command the controlled Pokémon to attack, regardless if it was their owner that they were attacking.\nIt`s control over the Pokémon was stopped when Pikachu`s Thunderbolt destroyed the control device. After Misty`s Togepi`s Metronome destroyed Butch and Cassidy`s base, Drowzee has not been seen since.",
