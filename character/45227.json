  "description" : "A mass production mobile suit used by the A.E.U.G. during the Gryps Conflict. After the war, it was incorporated into the Federation`s ground forces and stationed at various military facilities. By the standards of U.C. 0096, it cannot be denied that its performance is relatively low, though not as much as that of the RMS-179 GM II also used by the ground forces. It appears that its veteran pilots are able to compensate for this with their high skills.",
