  "description" : "The shortest of the Gangreen Gang. Little Arturo is now a girl, but the fast speech pattern of the original remains. Little Arturo has nine siblings and is often overlooked by her parents because of this. She is the least patient of the Gangreen Gang and will begin to fidget if she stays in one place too long. She is the fastest of the Gangreen Gang, but she doesn`t use it to her advantage in battle. Furthermore, she tires out fairly easily.",
