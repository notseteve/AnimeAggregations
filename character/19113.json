  "description" : "Kanhordari is the despotic emperor of Noseshecika, one of the three great countries alongside Onkamiyamukai and Kunnekamun. Large and physically dominating, he seems to hold a grudge against Kunnekamun and finally attempts to conquer them, although this attempt backfires horribly when Kunnekamun counterattacks with the Av Kamiw, conquering Noseshecika and killing Kanhordari. His body is eventually reanimated by Dii and destroyed for good by Hakuoro`s forces.",
