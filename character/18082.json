  "description" : "Takenaka Hanbee is Hideyoshi Toyotomi`s strategist. He is intelligent and extremely loyal to Hideyoshi. Around his enemies, he is narcissistic, cold and very cruel. Given the chance, he can wipe them all out by swinging his weapon. His favorite methods of assassination are back-stabbing his opponents at his weapon`s reach and snaring his opponents when they are not looking. Despite his physique, he suffers from tuberculosis. He is somewhat similar to Zorro in style and look (the face mask). His weapon is a whipsword.",
