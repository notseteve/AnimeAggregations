  "description" : "Toono Sawako is a friend of http://anidb.net/ch146853 [Yukie] who has recently moved to the so-called \"Ghost Mansion\". She claims that her house is haunted but oddly the ghosts seem to come out only when her husband is away due to work. She asks Yukie for help who then on her behalf goes to see http://anidb.net/ch145181 [Chuuzenji Akihiko].\nThe \"ghosts\" turned out to be http://anidb.net/ch149070 [Yamabe Yumi] and her http://anidb.net/ch149071 [husband] who have heard that there is a treasure hidden at the house and wanted the Toono couple to move out so they could claim it for themselves.",
