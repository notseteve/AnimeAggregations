  "description" : "Fifth year ro class. Age 14, Pisces, blood type O. Member of the Library Committee.\nGentle and full of kindness; he is a senpai that lovingly takes care of his underclassmen. Though his grades are excellent, his bad habit is that he`s always meandering and hesitating with a broad indecisiveness. After thinking too much, he`ll get tired and sleep right then and there. Of the \"three illness of the ninja\", he is the \"type who lacks thought\". Also, if he goes near a dry river bed, the moisture will expand his hair. Hachiya Saburou from the same class is often seen borrowing his face, lending them the relation of \"fifth-year rogumi`s specialty combination\". Yamada-sensei often says \"his honesty is his weakness\".\nSource: Wiki",
