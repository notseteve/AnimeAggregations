  "description" : "The custom Gunmen Gember first appeared in action on the deck of the Dai-Gurren as its owner, Guame, had retreated to it, to personally perform his public warning execution of the captured members of Team Dai-Gurren. It is the second Gunman to feature a transformation. It has the appearance of being rather broad and bulky starfish in its regular mech state and is somewhat insect like with its antennae, which can ensnare enemies. Its second form is a large face-like apparition and is also insect-like with sharp needles that resemble legs. The controls of the Gember differ from normal Gunmen to accommodate its user, as Guame is placed into a sphere-like crevice with a pair of mechanical hands aiding him. The only known attack of the Gember was its Gember Press, wherein the foe is caught in a hold and crushed by the needles that are released from its arms.\nThe time of the Gember was short lived, as it was destroyed by the Gurren-Lagann`s Giga Drill Break. However, its pilot ejected himself before his Gunman got obliterated.",
