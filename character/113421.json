  "description" : "The smallest of the disciples and the second of the group who spoke, his eyes bluish. His face is split in the middle from his lower jaw up to the nose, resembling a very grave cleft palate and two horn-like features on his forehead. He was sensitive about them, which was demonstrated when he told Casca to stop touching them when he led her to the torture room. He was also the one who led Nina there. His weapon of choice was a plier in each hand, to be used against heretics by pulling out their eyes.\nBerserk Wiki",
