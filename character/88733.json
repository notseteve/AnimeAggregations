  "description" : "Berserker of Red was originally Diemlet Pentel`s Servant. His current Master is http://anidb.net/ch88739 [Caster of Black].\n[spoiler=\"True Name and Noble Phantasm\"]His true name is Spartacus, the strongest gladiator from Thrace and the leader of a large-scale rebellion of slaves in Ancient Rome. He was affiliated with a gladiator training camp in the Campania region, but escaped with 78 of his comrades in 73 B.C. He managed to repulse an assault force of nearly three thousand dispatched by the Romans, leading to him being known as a hero who inspired armed uprisings by slaves in many places. His army grew to seven thousand men, and they kept defeating the Roman army without losing a single battle. They were unable to cross the Alps and instead decided to head to the island of Sicily. They hired pirates to make the voyage, but were betrayed and attacked by the Roman Legions. He always fought at the head of the front lines, and even when the revolt was subjugated by the army, he fought until his death. His name was carved in history as a hope of the oppressed humans.\nHis Noble Phantasm is Crying Warmonger, which increases his power the more damage he receives.[/spoiler]\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
