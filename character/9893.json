  "description" : "An old man who had made a lot of money, and one of the most powerful people in the underground. After building up massive funds from shady dealings in Japan`s post-war era, he uses this money to tempt people -especially young people- to bet their lives for the chance to win a large amount of money. He enjoys doing this, so a match between Akagi and Washizu was arranged. Washizu and Akagi played mahjong in an unusual way, of which Washizu calls `Washizu Mahjong` in which glass tiles replace most of the tiles that make the game different in many ways. -from English Wikipedia",
