  "description" : "Masquerain is an insectoid species of Pok√©mon that is the larger and more developed evolved form that a Surskit can metamorph into. Masquerain`s appearance is configured to resemble to a degree a large, scary face, with its two giant orange antennae resembling eyes and its red face and two black eyes resembling a red mouth with two black teeth. This serves as an intimidation tactic to ward off potential predators. The four parallelogram-shaped appendages on its bottom are its real wings, and their fast flapping motions give Masquerain the ability to fly forwards, sideways, and backwards like a helicopter. Masquerain can`t fly in rain, so it therefore shelters itself under large trees and leaves.",
