  "description" : "Akagi is introduced as a deceptively adult looking young boy with white hair, whose spark of genius transcends age and resides in gambling, especially in the game mahjong. Throughout the story, Akagi utilizes techniques other gamblers don`t dare to, in order to sway his opponents: brazen cheating, extremely risky maneuvers, far fetched bluffs, a blatant disregard for his own life. These actions make him a heretic among \"ordinary\" men, yet allow him to unflinchingly defeat his opponents with a level of play that is marked as godly. After gaining mythical status at 13 (1958), he disappears for 5 years and resurfaces to become a legendary figure in the whole of Japan. -from English and Japanese Wikipedia",
