  "description" : "This immense battleship, twice the size of cruisers like the Argama and Alexandria, was created to serve as the flagship of the Titan fleet. With a dozen mobile suit catapults and batteries of huge cannons, the Dogosse Gier is virtually a fleet unto itself. Although Char spies this ship under construction during the initial AEUG raid on the Titans` headquarters, it doesn`t enter battle until the Titans set out to capture the lunar city of Von Braun. The Dogosse Gier is initially entrusted to Paptimus Scirocco, but as the Titans` leaders become increasingly suspicious of their scheming underling, Bask Om decides to take charge of this mighty battleship himself.",
