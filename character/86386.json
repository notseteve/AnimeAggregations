  "description" : "Viktoriya is a Second Lieutenant in the Empire Army and serves under http://anidb.net/ch86183 [Tanya Degurechaff]. Later, she became Tanya`s adjutant.\nDifferent from other characters of the Empire, Viktoriya has a typical Russian name, instead of a German one. In fact, Viktoriya is actually a refugee from the Revolution of the Rus` Union and her family was originally a member of the Rus aristocratic. Having served under Tanya during the Rhine Battle, Viktoriya is more familiar with Tanya`s true personality, to which she shows fear, but also respect. As a result of knowing Tanya, Viktoriya is more able to keep up with Tanya compared to her other soldiers. However, despite knowing Tanya`s side character, Viktoriya seem to believe that Tanya actually care for her subordinates and her harsh treatment of them, is to ultimately ensure their survival.\nSource: Wikipedia",
