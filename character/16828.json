  "description" : "The http://anidb.net/ch16171 [Fourth Raikage]`s assistant acts as a go-between for the Raikage and http://anidb.net/ch12205 [Kumogakure]`s forces, giving them his orders and keeping him updated on their progress.\nShe`s a dark-skinned girl who is seen wearing a very formal attire during work hours, long earrings, and properly pulling her hair back into a bun except for the frontal part of it, which consists of two flat side bangs that fall along the sides of her face.\nShe remains calm in stressful situations and immediately completes the tasks she is given. Furthermore, she, like Darui, appears to be quite annoyed every time the Raikage bursts through walls whenever the use of doors is required, and even suggests that he`s broken through his office windows on more than one occasion.",
