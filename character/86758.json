  "description" : "Golisopod is a dual-type Bug/Water Pokémon.\nIt evolves from Wimpod starting at level 30.\nGolisopod is a large, menacing arthropod Pokémon in a hunched-over, humanoid posture. It has a light purplish inner body generously armored with a silvery exoskeleton. Golisopod`s bright purple antennae converge with its mouthparts on the front of its relatively small head, forming a sort of mask between its two eyes. The eyes are black and angular in shape, each with a light gray pupil that looks like a four-pointed star. Behind Golisopod`s head are three roundish segments of its shell, each with a long, upwardly-curved protrusion on either side and marked with a greenish triangle on the front; these segments cover its jutting neck. Below the neck are three pairs of arms. The two frontal pairs of arms are thin, each one tipped with a sharp, black claw. The rearmost pair of arms is the largest, and ends with two large, purple \"hands\" equipped with two large claws each. The back of each hand is plated with three angular pieces of armor, marked with more greenish triangles. On Golisopod`s upper back, three more plates of armor are visible, the two uppermost of which are large with more long protrusions on the sides. Golisopod`s body gets slightly thinner towards the gut, then curves forward again slightly at its round waist. A portion of shell resembling a loincloth surrounds the waist. Below this are Golisopod`s two large, round thighs, which match the color of its armor. Thin, purplish forelegs connect the thighs to Golisopod`s boot-shaped feet, each tipped with a single sharp, black toe.",
