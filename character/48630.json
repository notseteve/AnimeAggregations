  "description" : "Yang Neumann is a brilliant variable fighter designer and a genius hacker at only sixteen, he is a true prodigy by all standards. Shinsei Industries was confident enough in his genius to make him the chief engineer for their experimental fighter; the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19], their entry for the competition to select U.N. Spacy`s next gen fighter known as Project Super Nova. Due to his age, he is the butt of a lot of jokes, especially from his test pilot http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu] who likes nothing better than to ruin Yang`s precious prototypes with his dare devil antics.Yang is also a huge fan of http://anidb.net/ch48625 [Sharon Apple], and has used his hacker skills to infiltrate her highly guarded computer systems in an effort to steal her AI. He has all the parts except her emotions module which has proven to be beyond his skills since, unbeknownst to him, it doesn`t actually exist (http://anidb.net/ch48625 [Sharon]`s emotions are actually provided by her alleged producer http://anidb.net/ch48624 [Myung Fan Lone]).\nWhen Project Super Nova gets cancelled, he correctly predicts that http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu] is going to steal the http://anidb.net/ch48621 [YF-19] to stop the inauguration of its replacement, the http://anidb.net/ch48628 [X-9 Ghost], back in Macross City and manages to convince the hot headed pilot to take him along for the ride. When the crazed http://anidb.net/ch48625 [Sharon Apple] takes control of the city she also successfully hypnotizes Yang into shooting http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu]. He misses and http://anidb.net/ch48619 [Isamu] ejects him from the plane, presumably landing somewhere safe.Source: wiki",
