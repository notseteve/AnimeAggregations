  "description" : "Michikusa Shuntarou graduated from the Salvager training school with barely passing grades, and joins K2 Corporation through a relative. His father is the president of a major salvaging company. He is a new character introduced in the second series.\nCute-looking but totally air-headed, Michikusa is prone to dressing cutely as well (including donning Delmo staff uniforms on several occasions), and using a kappa doll and squeaky voice to try cheering up Rion when her mood is down, which earns him frequent beatings by Rion because he just succeeds in annoying her.",
