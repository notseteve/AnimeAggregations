  "description" : "Jangmo-o is a Dragon-type Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Hakamo-o starting at level 35, which evolves into Kommo-o starting at level 45.\nJangmo-o is a small, quadruped Pokémon similar to a dinosaur. The lower half of its body is black, while the upper half is light gray. It has a beak-like snout with a small, tooth-like spike in each corner of its lower jaw and big, red eyes. On the front of its head is a large, heart-shaped yellow scale. A small tuft similar to ears or small feathers extends from the back of its head on either side, and there is another small, white tuft on its chest. Six teardrop-shaped, loose-hanging scales form a half ring around its shoulders. These scales are gray with pale yellow along the outside edge. A solid yellow scale of the same shape is on the tip of its tail. Each of its feet has three yellow claws.\nWhile Jangmo-o trains diligently and remains humble, it has the pride of a warrior. It employs the scale on its forehead for both attack and defense, so it never shows its back to its foe. Many Trainers take this behavior has proof of this Pokémon`s valiant nature. Jangmo-o lives and trains with others of its kind in harsh areas that are far from other Pokémon and people.",
