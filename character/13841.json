  "description" : "The self-proclaimed \"old friend\" of Itoshiki Nozomu, who, like Nozomu, likes old things. It is later found out that they weren`t old friends (旧友) but rather \"one day friends\" (1日友) in elementary school. His name is a reference to the anime series Ikkyuu-san. He attempted to marry Rin, thus gaining an \"old name\" and becoming a member of an \"old family\", but Kafuka thwarted him in his advances.",
