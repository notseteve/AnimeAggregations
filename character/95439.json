  "description" : "The Carne Village is a small village in the http://anidb.net/ch95431 [Re-Estize Kingdom]. It is located at the frontier near the border with the http://anidb.net/ch95432 [Baharuth Empire], making it very close to the Great Forest of Tob where various demi-humans, including http://anidb.net/ch95428 [Nazarick], reside.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch72785 [Ainz] saved the village when it was attacked by soldiers of the http://anidb.net/ch95438 [Slane Theocracy] and the inhabitants have remained loyal to him ever since. They are so loyal, in fact, that they sided with Ainz when Nazarick and the Kingdom went to war.\nThe village later becomes part of the Sorcerer Kingdom after Nazarick was victorious in the war. The village has also started to take in demi-human inhabitants, starting with goblins summoned using an item given to the villagers by Ainz, then ogres from the Great Forest of Tob and most recently dwarfs who formed business relations with the Sorcerer Kingdom.\nSource: Wikipedia",
