  "description" : "The president and only member of his school`s calligraphy club. He is quite aloof and a bit slow on the uptake. He loves his brushes, and he often does calligraphy for the Raifuku shrine. He only does calligraphy when he is `inspired`, yet it takes him a while to realise that most of his sources of inspiration revolve around Yurie.",
