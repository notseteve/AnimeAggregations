  "description" : "The young leader of \"Dragon`s Watch,\" a militia group in the Shu Area, and one of the heroes who previously saved Kingdom World from a crisis. Though he is filled with a sense of justice, in some respects he still seems like a restless youth. From previous generations he has inherited a \"Haro\" that has mysterious powers. Thanks to his meeting with Wukong Impulse Gundam, he throws himself into battle, with the fates of worlds at stake.\nSource: Official page",
