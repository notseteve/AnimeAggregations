  "description" : "The Knights of the Round are a unit of the twelve most elite Knightmare Frame pilots in the Britannian Empire. They operate outside the normal chain of command of the Britannian Military, and are answerable only to the Emperor himself. They are considered nobility within the Empire, regardless of who or where they might have been before. The Knights each pilot a custom Knightmare Frame named after one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. Each member is given a rank of one to twelve, however, these numerical ranks are largely meaningless as an indicator of authority or skill level except for the Knight of One, who is considered the strongest warrior of the Empire, and has the right to request governance of a colony of his or her choice from the Emperor. Only eight of the twelve seats are filled throughout the course of the series.",
