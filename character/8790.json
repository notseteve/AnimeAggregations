  "description" : "Abigail is a bit of an enigma: He is the Fourth Lord of Havoc, and quite powerful. He claims to be the Priest and the Hand of Anslasax, and explains that he has existed since the days of the Old World, and exists to facilitate the resurrection of Anthrax. He curses Arshes with the Accused spell, which forces her to obey him, as if she does not, her body will be destroyed, and she will return as an immortal toad. Alone of all of the group he is able to take the \"three keys\" which seal the God of Destruction in sleep, and begin the spell to resurrect her.\nAbigail`s name is a reference to King Diamond`s best selling solo-album of the same name.",
