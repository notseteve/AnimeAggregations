  "description" : "Azelf, known as the Willpower Pokémon, is a legendary Pokémon that is part of the Psychic-type trio along with Uxie and Mesprit. It has a small blue body about the size of Mew, and is identical to Uxie and Mesprit except for its head. It has a blue cone shaped head with a jewel embedded in its forehead and also two blue dropping ears, yellow eyes, and eyelids the same dark blue as its head.\nReferred to as \"The Being of Willpower\", it can either make people give up on an activity or cause them to attempt the activity repeatedly. Also, if a human is to harm Azelf, in a scant five days, the offender would be immobile for all eternity. Residing and sleeping at the base of Lake Valor, it keeps the world in balance. It`s believed to have come from the same egg as Uxie and Mesprit.",
