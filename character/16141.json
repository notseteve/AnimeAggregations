  "description" : "Kiyota Nobunaga is always bragging about how he is the real star rookie of Kanagawa, instead of Rukawa. However, he tends to underestimate other teams, especially Shohoku, and this can lead to embarrassing situations, such as when Akagi flattened him with a dunk. Kiyota likes to call Hanamichi \"Red-furred Monkey\" while Hanamichi calls him \"Wild Monkey\".\nSource: wikipedia",
