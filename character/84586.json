There was also a woman in his previous life whom he loved, a fellow Exorcist who died alongside him.\nAfter their deaths, the bodies of Kanda and his lover were taken to http://anidb.net/ch32500 [Asian Branch], where their brains were harvested and implanted into new bodies as part of the Second Exorcist Program. About twenty years later, Kanda awoke in the Sixth Laboratory of the Asian Branch.\nSource: D.Gray-man Wiki, edited.",
