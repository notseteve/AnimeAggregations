  "description" : "The main male protagonist, Akira is a member of the Earth Clan, a clan of werewolves who have served as guardians and Knights for the Tepes family for centuries. Akira`s first encounter (that he can remember) with Mina was when he was a small child. Akira made a promise to always protect Mina, unaware until later that he had been born and raised to be Mina`s personal guardian/servant. Despite Mina`s occasional harsh treatment, Akira cares deeply for Mina, going so far as to protect her at the sacrifice of his own body if need be. As a werewolf, Akira possesses immense strength, reflexes, and senses. He also has an incredible resistance to physical harm and amazing regenerative abilities, capable of shrugging off bullet wounds and regrowing severed limbs. When vampires are revealed to the world, Akira is forced into protecting Mina constantly. His relationship to Mina further complicates his life, bringing him into conflict with his fellow human students, almost all of whom immediately treat him with distrust and hate for supposedly siding with the vampires.",
