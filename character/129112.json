  "description" : "Fuecoco is a Fire-type Pokémon introduced in Generation IX.\nIt evolves into Crocalor starting at level 16, which evolves into Skeledirge starting at level 36.\nAlong with Sprigatito and Quaxly, Fuecoco is one of three starter Pokémon of Paldea available at the beginning of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. They were also the first Generation IX Pokémon to be revealed to the public on February 27, 2022, through a Pokémon Presents video presentation.\nFuecoco is a bipedal crocodilian Pokémon with a mostly red body and a white stomach and face. Its body contains a small flame sac, which constantly leaks fire energy due to its size. The energy releases in the form of two yellow tufts on top of its head; more tufts of flame may emerge should Fuecoco get excited. Fuecoco has black eyes and triangular nostrils, and its mouth has three teeth, with one in the upper jaw and two in the lower jaw. It has stubby arms and large feet with two black toes on each foot. Fuecoco has yellow square scales on its stomach, back, tail, and the soles of its feet. These scales are warm to the touch, although they can become heated. The scales absorb external heat, such as from warm rocks where it lies on, to be turned into fire energy.\nFuecoco is laid-back and does things at its own pace. Fuecoco enjoys eating, and it will rush towards any food it sees.",
