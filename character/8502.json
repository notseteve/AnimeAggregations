  "description" : "Ptolemaios is the mothership for the Gundams of the Celestial Being. Structurally it has four separate docking bays, each with its own catapult to independently launch GN-001 - GN 005. As its main purpose is for the deployment of the Gundams, the ship itself is not armed.\nThe Ptolemaios relies on the GN Drives of the Gundams for main power generation. A special connector in each of the docking bays allows the ship to connect to the GN Drive housed within the Gundams to draw power from them. When all four Gundams are launched from the ship, the amount of energy available to the ship is severely limited.\nThe ship was destroyed by a joint attack of Alejandro`s mobile armor and GN-X`s of the UN Forces.",
