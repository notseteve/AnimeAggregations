  "description" : "\"Pandora - the first woman created by the gods. She was never to open the box she was given. When Pandora opened the box, all the evils inside where let out to inflict themselves upon the world. But tucked in at the bottom of the box, under the evils,was a small ray of... hope.\"\nWhen the world collapsed and life in a world where \"the laws of physics have died\" became unendurable for them, a group of twelve remaining members of the human race made the choice to live in a dream world instead. The Pandora Project, suggested and overseen by scientist http://anidb.net/ch19492 [Fuyuki Ikuo] and assisted by his wife http://anidb.net/ch19483 [Saegusa Miyako], let all brains of the surviving humans be connected and participate in a world created by the dreaming girl, http://anidb.net/ch39797 [Saegusa Mutsuki], who permanently removes all sad or desperate memories from their respective dreams in the process so that all other dreamers will have only happy memories. In doing so, this Pandora Project put a woman into \"the box\".\nBut mysteriously, certain tragic fragments of the http://anidb.net/ch9745 [unnamed protagonist]`s previous life keep reappearing (including his memory of his childhood friend http://anidb.net/ch9748 [Tamaki Maiko] having died in his arms) regardless how often Mutsuki deletes them. And in trying to make sense of all this he finally opens Pandora`s Box (and tears down the curtain of this theater play) by choosing reality (in the person of http://anidb.net/ch9747 [Watsuji Aya] whose world has become a meaningless facade due to Mutsuki`s actions) over this dream world (where Aya is forgotten but Maiko is still alive and acts according to his memory of her), thus making this project an interlude between destruction and hope.",
