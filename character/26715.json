  "description" : "Gokuraku (paradise) is the name of the video rental shop where http://anidb.net/ch16491 [Youta] got the http://anidb.net/ch15911 [Ai] video from. The Gokuraku Video shop is run by a http://anidb.net/ch16490 [strange old man].\nThis shop is visible only for people who are pure at heart. The videos it offers are special: Running one of these on a VCR makes the video girl float out of the TV screen and stay with their customer until the end of their \"airing time\". Stopping the tape would end their airing time immediately though. As the task for each video girl is comforting their customer they have been http://anidb.net/ch26714 [programmed] to being unable to fall in love with the person who rents their tape.\nGokuraku`s real role is to use Video Girls to obliterate their renter`s ability to love. In the opinion of the people behind Gokuraku, the pure hearted are too vulnerable to deal with the harsh realities of love, therefore destroying their ability to do so is the only way to protect them. This was supposed to be Ai`s purpose but the broken VCR did for that.",
