  "description" : "The King of the Celestial World Candidate who gave Sano his powers. The two officially pair up for the tournament when Sano risks his life to save a child from a burning building, and Inumaru does likewise despite Sano`s threats.\nInumaru`s credo is that he can not ignore people in danger regardless of the reason, which prompts Sano to join, and to think of Inumaru as his friend rather than his Candidate. In Dogura Mansion, after being told that Sano joined Robert`s Ten to save him from the Death Pentagon (a small black bug that Karlpacchio attaches to Wanko`s neck, that would suck all of Wanko`s blood out of him on command, thus killing him), he contrives to destroy himself, so that Sano can be freed from his obligation.\nHe gives Mori his power, thus breaking the most important rule of the tournament, in order to force himself to go to Hell so that the others would be saved from certain circumstances that threaten the rest of the Ueki Team. He is the one who gave Mori her power.\nWas chosen as God at the end of the series.",
