  "description" : "Viro is a young girl with long purple hair and large glasses. She helps Cou and quickly becomes acquainted with the other members of the group. Viro is later revealed to be a spy for the opposing group who has their eyes on Ren, but she`s able to travel with the party with little suspicion because of her clumsy and air-headed qualities.\nIn the anime, Viro also becomes infatuated with Cou and his kind personality and soon becomes hesitant in carrying out her mission. Viro reacts with Cou to take the form of a large bluish drill-like weapon around his right arm. She sacrifices herself saving Cou from an attack by Gladius.\nIn the manga, she turns on the party despite Rowen`s attempts to save her. In the end, she turns to dust after her core stone is broken. She states \"Viro\" isn`t her name but a term for all human women with artificial elemental gelades. Her saliva is poison to Edel Raids.",
