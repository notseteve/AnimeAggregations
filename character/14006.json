  "description" : "The attractive elder twin sister of Kinoshita Hideyoshi. Due to their disparity in academic abilities, she feels superior to her younger brother, whom she thinks is trash. During the classroom wars in volume 1, Hideyoshi, while acting on a strategy of Yuuji, masqueraded as his sister and branded the whole of class C as filthy pigs, sowing discord between class C and class A, saving F from a potential alliance between class C and class B. And the proud Yuuko bears a deep grudge against Hideyoshi and class F for the incident.",
