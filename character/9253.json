  "description" : "Akira is the eponymous, principal subject of the story. Akira was a young boy who developed transcendent psionic, nearly god-like abilities when serving as a test subject for secret government ESP experiments in the 1980s. He subsequently lost control of this power and annihilated Tokyo in 1988. After the cataclysmic event, Akira`s dead body was recovered and subjected to every test known to modern science, which proved unable to solve the mystery. His remains were placed within a cryogenic chamber underneath the Neo-Tokyo Olympic Stadium, to be entrusted to the study of future generations.\nSource: en.wikipedia.org",
