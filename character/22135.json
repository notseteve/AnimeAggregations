  "description" : "Tsurugi Minko is a 17-year-old apprentice chef and resident at Kissuisou. She has a very cold demeanor, often telling Ohana to `die` following their first encounter, though when this is considered too harsh by Ohana, she settles for calling her a balut instead. Though she is hard working, she becomes passive when being scolded for her mistakes and is usually victim to Ohana`s mishaps. She displays great jealousy when Ohana is praised by other staff. She, together with Ohana, Nako and Yuina are in the same class at high school.",
