What`s more, he`s hard on himself but very kind to everyone else. His grandfather ran a shop selling musical instruments and he learned about all sorts of musical genres from him. He`s childhood friends with Koharu Mitsurugi, and used to bring him home whenever he would get caught by the police. In the sharehouse, he`s in charge of general housework.\nHis D persona is a priest and the \"only human being\". He had accidentally summoned FELIX and is now working with him due to his sense of responsibility.",
