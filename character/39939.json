  "description" : "Midorikawa Nao is Miyuki`s classmate and a member of the school`s soccer team. Nao is straightforward and reliable with a strong sense of justice, though she gets very frustrated when things don`t go her way. She takes on a motherly role due to being the eldest child of the six in a big family, and has little interest in girlish fashion. Her potential as a Pretty Cure awakened while protecting her siblings from harm by an Akanbe. As Cure March, her dark green hair tints to a mint shade and grows longer before gaining two extra ponytails, and her theme color is green. She can manipulate wind in this form and can run incredibly fast.\nShe introduces herself as \"Courageous, piercing cold, a clean-cut match! Cure March!\"",
