  "description" : "Butler was a scientist and magician that used to work for Team Magma. He was fired after a failed attempt to create a Groudon from fossils. Realizing he needed more power, he wanted help from the powers of Jirachi. Butler`s intentions were more evil than his girlfriend, Diane, suspected, so she tried to prevent him from hurting Jirachi when she fled with Ash, Brock, May, Max, and Jirachi. After following them via a tracking device on Diane`s van, Butler captured Jirachi and used its power. Instead of resurrecting Groudon, it instead created an evil being that was similar to it.\nAfter begging for forgiveness, he received help to stop the fake Groudon. When the Groudon was destroyed and everyone was saved, Butler and Diane reunited and together they agreed to protect Pok√©mon.",
