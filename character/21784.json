  "description" : "A teen that is concerned for his family; he is one of the only ones who hasn`t been brainwashed by Shindo. His concern is noted when Shindo notices he didn`t take part in the orgy in chapter 11. The others teens, now finally able to do what they want, don`t like the idea of their families being in danger. Shindo persuades others that Yamada`s been corrupted and suggests that, for the sake of the new world, they toos him off. The other teens do so and drive off, leaving him to die, even waving as he pleads to be let back on. The boy is shown one last time as a zombie lunges for his head. This scene shows how corrupt the kids have gotten. It is not shown if Yamada is officially dead, or if he escaped his attacker.",
