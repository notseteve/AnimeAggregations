  "description" : "A humanoid weapon discovered in Module 77 of the JIOR Sphere. When its pilot was registered and authenticated, its white armor changed to black and it showed what the power concealed within it was capable of. The light given off by the unit has the unusual property of solidification (Solid Afterglow). Although the red-hued Unit 1 is equipped with the standard array of close-quarters / long-range / defensive armaments, this is a special standard that puts the power of humanoid weaponry on full display.\nSource: aniplexusa.com",
