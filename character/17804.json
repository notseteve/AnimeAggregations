They serve to oppose http://anidb.net/ch17803 [Cruxis] and the http://anidb.net/ch17802 [Desians].\nThey are often thought to be Desians and will gladly use these mistakes to their advantage. Yuan is the real leader, but to the public http://anidb.net/ch17788 [Botta] acts as the leader. This way Yuan is able to stay by http://anidb.net/ch16629 [Yggdrasill]`s side, even though opposing him.",
