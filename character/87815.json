  "description" : "Flora is http://anidb.net/ch87813 [Schierke]`s mistress, who teaches her in the arts of magic and Od, the life force of all things. Before her passing, she was regarded as one of the most powerful humans in existence and even gained the respect of http://anidb.net/ch49433 [Skull Knight].\nFlora is a kind person who likes to help people in need, even if she doesn`t know them, as in the past she traveled from place to place assisting others. She is well-mannered when she speaks and doesn`t bear any hatred towards the Holy See alliance, despite their teachings driving her away and leading people to fear and hate witches. Her relationship with her disciple, Schierke, is like that of a mother and daughter; Flora lets the young girl rest her head on her lap in sunspots and treats her to afternoon tea.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
