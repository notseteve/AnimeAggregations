  "description" : "Kyuuso is the head of the http://anidb.net/ch37613 [Kyuuso Clan] and self-proclaimed \"emperor of the night\". He is an anthropomorphic rat youkai who first appears as a light-haired playboy going by the name Seiya. He runs a host club, Club Chu, near the east entrance of Ukiyoe Town`s shopping district. He calls http://anidb.net/ch19463 [Gyuuki] \"boss\" and acts like a cheerful playboy to attract women to the club - where he and his underlings literally devour them in the basement. In reality, he is a cruel and cold-hearted rat who takes advantage of people`s weaknesses. He is able to summon rats to do his bidding, and seems to hate rejection.\nKyuuso kidnaps http://anidb.net/ch19473 [Yura] and http://anidb.net/ch15459 [Kana] to use as bait in luring out http://anidb.net/ch15458 [Rikuo], and declares that his clan intends to take over as leaders of the http://anidb.net/ch37514 [Nura Clan]. He orders Rikuo to send out a decree to all the Nura Clan leaders stating that he retracts his claim to be the Third, threatening to kill Yura and Kana if Rikuo doesn`t comply. When http://anidb.net/ch17492 [\"Night\" Rikuo] and the Hyakki Yakou of the main house thwart his plans, Kyuuso changes into http://anidb.net/ch37682 [a large grotesque rat] and tries to kill Rikuo. However, he is burned to death by \"Night\" Rikuo`s \"Ougi Meikyou Shisui, Sakura\" technique.\nSource: Wikipedia",
