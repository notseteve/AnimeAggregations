  "description" : "A young child, Mariemaia is apparently the daughter of Leia Barton and Treize Khushrenada, conceived during the meeting between the two on Colony X-18999 (as detailed in the Episode Zero manga). Supposedly dying at an early age, Mariemaia later resurfaced as the figurehead of the Mariemaia Army, which largely consisted of soldiers who had been loyal to Treize. Thanks to her grandfather Dekim`s grooming, she was fully prepared to ravage the Earth and take her place as the World Sovereign, believing this to be what her father, Treize, would have wanted. She continued believing this until Relena slapped some sense into her-- literally. When Lady Une explained to the young girl that Dekim`s goals were not the same as Treize`s, Mariemaia realized her mistake and jumped in front of Relena to save her from being killed by Mariemaia`s enraged grandfather, resulting in Mariemaia being shot through the spine. She was given medical attention, and is later shown (in a wheelchair, though later appearances show her to have healed) visiting her father`s grave with Lady Une.",
