  "description" : "He is http://anidb.net/ch32430 [Sena`s] father and the chairman of St. Chronica`s. He is a friend of Kodaka`s father, and pulled strings so that http://anidb.net/ch32433 [Kodaka] could attend the school. He`s embarrassed by the unusual pronunciation of his first name (which normally would be pronounced \"Tenba\"). He constantly badmouths Kodaka`s father, but only because he truly values him as a best friend. He seems intent to betroth Sena to Kodaka, often saying that he considers Kodaka to be \"a man I can entrust Sena to\". He`s a wealthy man always seen wearing traditional clothing, and is quite weak to alcohol.\nSource: Wiki",
