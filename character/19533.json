  "description" : "Shouko hosts a radio talk show in Sapporo called Cappuccino Break where she discusses romantic issues with her audience. Every love story Shouko hears is fuel for her talk show. Secretly, Shouko is dating her closest friend Takeda whom she loves, but Takeda is already married with a wife and daughter and warns Shouko not to make unexpected scenes. Elsewhere, Shouko receives gifts from someone called \"Radio Boy\", which gets the production staff worried that Shouko might have a potential stalker after her. When a woman calls in to the show about her heartaches with a married man, Shouko breaks down and says on the air that she wants to give up. Her fans call and come in to support her, showing her that she`s not as alone as she thinks.\nSource: Wikipedia",
