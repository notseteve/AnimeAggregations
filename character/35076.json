  "description" : "The Vice-President of IGO, he is a very large, muscular man with a big, black beard and mustache and thick, black hair with a stripe of white hair down the middle. He keeps one eye closed at all times, as well as a nose plug over the bridge of his nose. When these are removed, which he does when preparing to fight Grinpatch, he becomes more beastly and his muscles bulge and his clothes begin to tear. When Grinpatch comes to the First Biotope, he is disappointed that Stajun or Tommyrod had not come, showing not only his delight in fighting, but also his knowledge of the Bishoku-kai.",
