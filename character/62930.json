  "description" : "Morana is a trainer that traveled to the Isshu region from the Sinnoh region to close down the Sanyo Gym. She takes pleasure in humiliating gym leaders by forcing them to battle with her and accept unreasonable offers to shut down their gyms.\nShe challenged Chili and Cress and defeated them both but they didn`t close down the gym as they told her about their brother Cilan who was also a gym leader. She tracked down Cilan and challenged him also. Cilan`s marriage with his Yanappu proved to be a powerful combination and they defeated Morana to nullify her attempt to close down the gym. She vowed that the next time she met Cilan, she would make sure that she defeated him.",
