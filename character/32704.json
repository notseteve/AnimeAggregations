  "description" : "Ash`s Palpitoad was caught at a lake while Ash was enroute to Raimon City. Ash`s Oshawott was forced to battle Palpitoad because it came out of the water to protect its lake which it thought that Ash and Ash`s Oshawott were trespassing in. During the battle, Ash`s Oshawott managed to master its Aqua Jet and that proved to be the decisive factor in the battle as Palpitoad was knocked out and Ash caught it.",
