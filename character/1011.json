  "description" : "A girl in Ryuuji`s class, and is a close friend to Taiga. She is also known by the pet name \"Minorin\". In contrast to the negative Taiga, Minori is always smiling and cheerful, but is also a natural airhead. She is very athletic and is the captain of the girl`s softball club at school, though at the same time she holds many part time jobs. She is a glutton when it comes to food, but is also constantly combating with dieting, calling herself a Diet Warrior. She has a habit of singing cheerfully off key and tends to walk with more energy than needed (such as kicking up her legs with each step). She seems to get a thrill out of being scared: she pretends to be terrified of supernatural things in hopes that others will take advantage of this statement and try to frighten her. Despite her air-headed tendencies, she is very perceptive to other people`s characters, and is one of the few people to see Ryuuji for the gentle person he is, and is also not fooled by Ami`s act of innocence.",
