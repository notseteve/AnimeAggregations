Lukish was separated at a young age from her family, a king and queen, when they were killed by her brother Bad. After suffering an injury because of her escape, she was rescued and taken in by the hag. After being given treatments, Lukish went through several changes. Her once pale skin was now a dark tan color. She gained exceedingly great strength, as well as immunity to poisons and is, herself, poisonous. Anyone touching her skin for an extended period runs the risk of dying a slow, horrible death. It is revealed these changes were due to the medicine`s ingredients being from the liver of a Basilisk dragon. As Lukish is the youngest of the Midnight Panthers, she is not allowed to participate in assassination missions and instead has to hunt dragons as ingredients for the old hag.\nSource: Wiki",
