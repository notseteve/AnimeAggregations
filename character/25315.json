  "description" : "Miki Sayaka is Madoka`s classmate who, after helping Madoka rescue Kyubey, ends up getting an offer to become a Puella Magi herself. She cares deeply for her friends, and wants to help an ill boy named Kyousuke Kamijou, whom she has a crush on. She becomes a Puella Magi after using her wish to cure Kyousuke`s hand, which was damaged in an accident which robbed him of his ability to play the violin. Sayaka`s weapon of choice is a sword and, like Mami, she can produce multiple swords at a time. She also has regenerative powers stronger than anyone else due to the nature of her wish. Sayaka hates people that only think of themselves at the cost of hurting others and is easily provoked into a fight.",
