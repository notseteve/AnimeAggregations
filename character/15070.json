  "description" : "The captain of the Freeden, a Vulture ship. He was once a Newtype pilot of the old United Nations Earth who piloted a Gundam X in the 7th Space War, and it was also him who fired the fatal shot which changed history. Now he searches the Earth for Newtypes to rescue and protect. It seems that he has had feelings for a fellow Newtype named Lucille Lilliant for many years, and at the end of the series he gets together with his advisor Sala Tyrrell and works as a liaison between the Earth Governments and the Space Colonies.\nJamil Neate and Lancerow Dowell`s rivalry mirrors that of the Newtype aces Amuro Ray and Char Aznable. Their final battle in 7th Space War is similar to the final clash of the original Gundam series between the Gundam and the Zeong. However, Gundam X goes to an alternate way at the last, where Lancerow saved Jamil`s life and worked as the representative of the SRA in the peace conference after the war.",
