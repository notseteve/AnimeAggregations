  "description" : "Ribombee is Mina`s main Pokemon partner. Ribombee rolls pollen into all kinds of puffs for use in battle or to eat. They say Ribombee can differentiate what powers the different flowers have by their auras. It is able to synchronize its heart with both people and Pokémon by sitting on their head.\nIt battled against Sophocles`s Vikavolt in the Top 16 round of the Alola League. Mina`s Ribombee showed off its fast movements and its ability to dodge moves making it hard for Vikavolt to land any attacks with it zigzagging all the time until Vikavolt anticipated Ribombee’s movements and caught it with its pincers. It used Signal Beam while caught and knocked out Ribombee.",
