  "description" : "Kodai`s Mismagius has been one of Kodai`s most trusted Pok√©mon for many decades. It evolved into a Mismagius at some point after the disaster events at Crown City. While Kodai was attempting to get to the second ripple of time, Mumage used its Psychic to stop Satoshi, Celebi and Pikachu from interfering until Pochama`s Bubblebeam managed to stop it. Pikachu then managed to get free and used Thunderbolt and Volt Tackle on it to stop it from being able to help Kodai any further.",
