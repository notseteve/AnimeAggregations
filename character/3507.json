  "description" : "The strongest and most dangerous antagonist in Soul Eater, and the first demon god, or kishin. He was supposedly a human who existed before Shibusen, although Shinigami wondered whether he was really human to begin with. Asura had strange habits, covering his head with long scarves and wearing five to six shirts on his body; all because he did not trust anyone. In appearance he is rather skinny, and each strand of hair on his head looks like an eye, the symbol for kishin. He was the strongest member of the \"Eight Powerful Warriors,\" a group formed by Shinigami which predated Shibusen. Asura was greatly feared, having destroyed all of the witches of the East by himself. Asura was always fearful, so he became attached to power to protect himself and started taking the souls of people who were not listed. He even went so far as to eat his own weapon partner out of fear, resulting in his madness and transformation into the first kishin. Afterward, Asura`s very existence caused insanity and terror to spread throughout the world. To stop him, Shinigami ripped off Asura`s skin and used it to imprison him under Shibusen, then Shinigami rooted his own body and soul down to prevent him from awakening. Asura is eventually resurrected by Eruka and Free upon Medusa`s orders. Even partially awoken, he knocks out Black Star and Kid in a single blow and battles Shinigami on equal ground. Shinigami`s movements were limited by his connection to Death City, allowing Asura to escape. He flew to an unknown destination to regain his strength, but once again Asura is causing insanity and terror to infect the world.",
