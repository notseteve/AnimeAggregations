  "description" : "Anti-Skill is the city`s police and security forces. Unlike Judgment, most members of Anti-Skills are adults who are mostly normal people and even school teachers who are trained to deal with the city`s day-to-day activities and security, in addition to dealing with rogue psychics who abuse their powers. Most members of Anti-Skills are seen with special SWAT armor that resist psychic powers along with firearms and riot gear, which shows how serious the situation has to be for them to be called out. They are also responsible in investigating and stopping the experiments that are against the law and inhumane to students but due to the interventions by the city administration, they are stopped from investigating experiments that were approved by the Board of Directors. Their symbol is a three-point spear shaped like a capital \"E\" turned 90 degrees to the left.",
