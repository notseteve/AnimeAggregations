  "description" : "The base of the R-Gun was transformed because of the effects of the Zehirut Crystal. It was based off of various types of technology using the data from things such as the SRX Project, Cybuster, Granzon, and Valsion. Its form is similar to that of the Astranagant, which exists in a parallel world. In this world, Ingram was not able to obtain the Cross Gate Paradigm System from Euzeth, and was not able to create the Astranagant.",
