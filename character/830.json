  "description" : "Kingdra is resemblant of a large, blue weedy sea dragon with two branch-like horns on its head and two pairs of flippers on each side. It is said that Kingdra lives and sleeps at the bottom of the sea floor, at extreme underwater depths that are otherwise devoid of life due to water pressure. It also usually hides in underwater caves. It is believed to create maelstroms by yawning. When a storm arrives, it is said to awaken and wander about in search of prey. When it comes to the surface, it creates a huge whirlpool that can swallow even ships.",
