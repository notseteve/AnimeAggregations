  "description" : "Furuichi is a friend of Akiyuki, and like Haru, practices martial arts, although it seems that she is much better than him. Unlike Akiyuki, Furuichi is slightly more cynical and serious, although he is playful enough to bet with Haru on whether Akiyuki will be late or not. Furuichi joins the Mainsoul military, and demonstrates great skill in fighting Xam`d, whilst his relationship with Haru drifts apart. As a result, the reunion of Akiyuki and Haru is interrupted by him and he declares his intentions of killing Akiyuki, due to his cold indifference over the identities of Xam`d. Furuichi later volunteers to undergo an `enhancement` program to make himself a better Mainsoul pilot, the result of which, ironically, causes Furuichi to turn into one of the opponents he was training to fight, a Xam`d. Furuichi`s hiruko resides within his right thigh. Fueled by his anger and jealousy towards Akiyuki, Furuichi`s hiruko causes him to continue to become more grotesque until he is subdued by Akiyuki and turned back to normal by Nakiami. He is captured by the Mainsoul military, but escapes while being transported to the base. Soldiers confront him while he is buying drinks for himself, his \"beloved\" Haru, and his best friend, perhaps finally accepting and coming to terms with Akiyuki. He then decapitates himself with his Xam`d arm before the soldiers are able to recapture him, saying that he wasn`t meant to be.",
