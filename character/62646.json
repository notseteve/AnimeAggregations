  "description" : "Japanese God of the Moon - Tsukiyomi. He is quiet and sometimes painfully blunt. He is the big brother of Susanoo Totsuka Takeru, the Japanese God of the Sea. He always take notes about whatever Yui says regarding humans. He is assigned by Thoth Caduceus to be the disciplinary head. Tsukito seems cool, not interested in anything and rarely shows expressions. Nevertheless he is responsible and dutiful. Although he is an unsociable person, he somehow always gets involved with Apollon and gets dragged into the problem. He sees the idea of the school as just another task and tries to perform it without getting emotionally involved. He enjoys moon gazing, being god of the Moon. Like his brothers, Tsukito was born from Izanagi`s washing of himself in the waters of Yomi. Nothing much about him has been revealed, except that he managed to calm Takeru`s rampage, and received a rabbit charm from him at some point.\nSource. en.wikipedia",
