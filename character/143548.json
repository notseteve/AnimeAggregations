  "description" : "Third-year student and leader of the third division group of the Executive Council. He proclaims himself \"the last samurai\", following bushido. Being a gentleman, he despises cowardly ways of fighting. His style of fighting is using a hybrid b≈ç that can turn into a sansetsukon. When fighting, he is very violent, but he does not take pleasure in hurting his enemies. As a samurai, he seeks for strong opponents and feels honored for fighting against them. He is currently ranked 9th of the Toudou Academy`s strongest fighters and is the reserve of the Executive Council on the Election Tournament.\nSource: wikipedia.org",
