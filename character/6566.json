  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch6556 [Ayumi]`s older brother Yuuji can be somewhat callous and rude. For example, he steals her cookies and barges into her room without knocking. The opposite to http://anidb.net/ch6558 [Koyoi], he has a sister complex, for which he claims the love is purely brotherly. Like all other guys at his school, he cowers at hearing the name of http://anidb.net/ch6565 [Misao Zaitsu], and is under the impression that his sister has fallen for Misao.",
