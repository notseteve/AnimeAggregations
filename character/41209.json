  "description" : "Thane is an aspiring Pokémon Trainer who`s father has a bunch of Pokémon. Thane ended up borrowing his fathers Pokémon so that he and his friends could have Pokémon battles together. His family had traveled to Yamabuki City in the Kanto region and he saw a Pikachu while he was there so he was able to correctly identify Ash`s Pikachu. His personality is a bit of a spoiled brat and a know-it-all but he easily controlled when he relents his position to appease his friends.\nBattle against Glen\nIn the first battle against Glen, Glen pushed Thane`s Father`s Patrat and Thane`s Father`s Blitzle to the point of exhaustion before they finally decided to stop the battle. Glen then told Thane to get some more of his fathers Pokémon so they could continue battling. Not wanting to disappoint Glen or make him mad, Thane went to go get them and Glen went to go look for Nick who had shown them Pikachu earlier and had initially wanted to battle.\nDouble Battle against Nick\nAfter Thane`s Father`s Blitzle and Thane`s Father`s Patrat were too tired to battle, Thane went back to his dad and borrowed Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad so he and his friends could continue battling. Glen commanded both of the Pokémon in a double battle against Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok even though Thane was supposed to command one of the Pokémon.\nThane attempted to help out by giving Glen advice by specifically telling him to match up Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad against Pikachu because of the type advantage but Glen wouldn`t take the advice. The inexperience of Glen and his unwillingness to accept advice proved to be the reasons that Thane`s Father`s Scolipede and Thane`s Father`s Seismitoad lost the battle.\nNick won the double battle and he was quite moved to have participated in a simulated Pokémon battle. He fought against Glen the best that he could but Glen got a bit upset that he lost. Ash made Glen apologize and the two of them continued to be friends. Glen and his friends hoped to have another Pokémon battle someday against each other. After watching the Pikachu and Ash`s Krokorok battle each other, Thane was even more moved to become a Pokémon Trainer someday.",
