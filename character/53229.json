  "description" : "Oboro is the strongest assassin within the http://anidb.net/ch87781 [Tenshouin Naraku] branch. He is a major antagonist in the series after his introduction in the Courtesan of a Nation Arc.\nHis most remarkable physical trait is the long scar the Naraku caused him on his face during his childhood. The dark circles around his eyes appear to be caused by his anemia. He has light-gray hair and grey eyes.\nOboro appears with two different outfits. He initially wore a Buddhist monk robe with the Yatagarasu pattern attached to his robe. He combined it with a large praying bead necklace around his neck. During his first appearance, he disguised himself with a Tengai hat, usually worn by komusous. The Tengai was modified to fire several poison needles. The second outfit Oboro wore during the latest appearances is an attire more akin to a ninja outfit and the Yatagarasu pattern attached to it. His scarf is noticeable as well.\nDuring his encounter with http://anidb.net/ch1162 [Gintoki] and http://anidb.net/ch1662 [Takasugi], the latter stabbed his left eye in the same way as as Oboro did to Takasugi during the Joui War.\nSource: Gintama Wiki",
