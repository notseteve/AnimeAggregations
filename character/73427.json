  "description" : "He appears at first as a gumpy man who never greets anybody, which is something Pollyanna has to inquire about.\nOf course he`s not a grumpy old man at all, but somebody whose heart has been broken in the past. He went on travels to China and India to forget about everything, but returned to his family estate. With Pollyanna`s cheerful manner to always look for something to be happy about, she also manages to change John`s heart to the better.",
