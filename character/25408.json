  "description" : "Kigai Yuuto is a polite but amoral young man who works as a bureaucrat in a Tokyo Ward Office. He never lets on to the happy young couples turning in their marriage licenses that he is a Dragon of Earth who seeks to destroy humanity. He is frequently dressed in a pink shirt and white overcoat, and most people who see him remark that he looks like a pimp. He is Kanoe`s lover but is amused that Satsuki seems to have a crush on him.\nHe is a water master, having the ability to summon floods and hurl water bolts. He can even transform himself into water, once saving Satsuki from being recaptured by the Freemasons by entering the parking lot where she faced them through the sprinkler system. His natural enemy is fire, and as such he comes up against Kasumi Karen on more than one occasion.\nSource: en.wiki",
