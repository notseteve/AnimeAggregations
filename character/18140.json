  "description" : "Madoka is a strong competitor in the Kantou Regional games who fights against Suzuka and Hikaru, losing to both. Madoka is a Kung Fu artist, using martial arts as her angel`s chief fighting tactics. She has a strong desire to defeat Kobayashi Hatoko`s angel, Suzuka to recover her family`s \"lost pride\". While spectating Hikaru`s fight against another contestant, she and her sister make it clear to Saito Kaede and Jonouchi Sai that she will not lose to anyone until after Suzuka is defeated. Arisu and Madoka sabotage Hikaru with a transmitter that will block Misaki`s thoughts from reaching her doll in the hopes of winning, but are caught by Mihara Ohjirou. After losing, Madoka obtains a new outlook on why people play Angelic Layer and realizes that it was made to be fun for any person, to the slight annoyance of her sister. Madoka`s angels are created by her younger sister, Arisu.",
