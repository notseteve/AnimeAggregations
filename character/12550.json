  "description" : "Megumi lives in a ramen restaurant. She is the second best student in Class 2-A, yet she`s dissatisfied with it. She`s jealous of Ruriko, seeing that she has everything - she`s rich, intelligent and popular. Megumi`s quite competitive, so she hates Ruriko who always excels.\nHer power (the Gate of Walls/Gate of Steel) awakened when her Mr. Fukuoka, a teacher in History, became an Invader. For her, Mr. Fukuoka was the only one who understood her, because he always is in favor of her. She joins the Gate Keepers not solely because of the Fukuoka incident, but because she doesn`t want Ruriko to be any better than her.\nMegumi is a loner. She always talks to herself whenever she observes something. Like Misao, she`s somewhat antisocial, but to be specific, she hates the opposite sex.",
