  "description" : "Izumi is the second child of the Takanashi family. She is supposedly a novelist, however, she appears to be suffering from perennial writer`s block and doesn`t seem to have written anything of significance in a very long time. The fact that she doesn`t move, not even to clean her living space of her failed attempts at writing, and even considers standing up straight to be too much of an effort, is a running gag.",
