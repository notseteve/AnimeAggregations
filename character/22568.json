  "description" : "Mandi is a Pokémon Trainer who was drawn against Ash in the 1st round of a Pokémon League finals tournament held in the Indigo Plateau in Kanto. The match took place on the randomly drawn water field.\nMandi is known for his exciting battle styles which has won him many fans. Additionally, Mandi uses this attitude when he isn`t battling and sometimes performs magic tricks to amazing his audiences.\nAnother personality trait Mandi has is that he can be extremely arogant towards people and shown this when he refused to shake Ash`s hand before they battled, claiming that his hands are for holding Pokéballs only.\nMandi`s first round battle ended in defeated in a whitewash when Krabby evolved into Kingler just after it defeated Mandi`s Exeggutor. Kingler went on to defeat Mandi`s Seadra and Golbat.\nThe nature of the battle caused Mandi to lose his composure a couple of times and he was very disappointed when he was defeated.",
