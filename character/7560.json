  "description" : "Shima Tetsuo is http://anidb.net/ch7558 [Kaneda]`s best friend since preschool and the second principal subject of the story`s theme. Tetsuo is shown as a black sheep in the gang he and Kaneda are part of, and quietly suffers from a deeply rooted inferiority complex. He admires his friend yet at the same time strongly resents his own reliance upon him. After his psychokinetic abilities manifest, Tetsuo quickly becomes Kaneda`s nemesis; he desires Kaneda`s motorcycle (a symbol of status and power), and seeks to prove himself supremely powerful, without need of protection. Eventually, his power overwhelms him and the Espers are forced to awaken http://anidb.net/ch9253 [Akira] to stop him.\nSource: wikipedia.org",
