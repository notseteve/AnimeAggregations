  "description" : "Narusegawa Naru bears an extremely fiery temper and a tendency to inflict violent physical punishment (mostly on Keitarou). This 17-year old student and resident of Hinata Inn is described as \"one fuse short of a cannon\". She is very intelligent, having placed top in the nation on the college practice entrance exams at their cram school. Of all the girls in the Hinata Inn, she is victimized the most by Keitarou`s clumsiness, which often results in her being naked, exposed in some fashion, or lying in very suggestive positions. Eventually, she develops very strong feelings for him, though has great difficulty in admitting these feelings to herself and Keitarou. Like Keitarou, she strives to get into Tokyo University because of a promise she had made to someone.",
