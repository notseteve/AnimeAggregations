  "description" : "Tomoe Mami is a Puella Magi contracted to http://anidb.net/ch25645 [Kyuubee] and a third year student at Madoka`s school, living alone in a penthouse after her parents`s deaths. She has the ability to produce a near-infinite amount of flintlock rifles, can use ribbons to suspend her enemies, and is also able to perform healing magic. Due to being involved and seriously injured in a car accident (which also claimed the lives of her parents) at the time Kyuubey approached her, she was forced to use her wish to save herself. Unlike other Puella Magi, who mostly focus on obtaining valuable Grief Seeds, Mami is particularly focused on saving those around her. Though she often has a cheery disposition, she is also often lonely and scared due to the nature of her work and is pleased when Madoka offers to become her partner.\nSource: Wiki",
