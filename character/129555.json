  "description" : "This Golem was the leader of the tribe of Geodude and Graveler at Wela Volcano. It uses electricity to launch rocks and stones and other Geodude and its eyebrows and mustache are gathered iron filings which are thick as a sign of strength to the Graveler and Geodude.\nThe Ultra Guardians visited Wela Volcano and concluded that the magnetic anomalies were caused by the Graveler and Geodude because they were chased out of their normal eating areas by rock hunters looking for Spark Stones.\nLusamine suggested that Wela Volcano needed more patrols but would be too much for Officer Jenny to handle by herself. The Golem appeared and overheard the conversation and wanted to be caught by the Hiker Trio`s when they said they were the perfect people for the job as they knew the area like the back of their hands.",
