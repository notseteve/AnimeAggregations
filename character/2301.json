  "description" : "Kuonji head maid and Shinra`s personal attendant. She is known to have a violent short temper. Her name sounds similar to \"penis\". This is shown to greatly aggravate her when the Uesugi siblings make fun of it. Venis grew up in a poor section of an unnamed European city, working at a relative`s restaurant while learning to cook, learning to fight while protecting herself from those who would try to grab her, and teaching herself maths in the streets. After the restaurant closed, she was picked up off the streets by the Colonel, who was impressed by her skill in cooking and brought her to work at the Kuonji house.",
