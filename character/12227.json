  "description" : "Dvergr is Alv`s partner. Though Dvergr is a major antagonist for most of the series, her personality is extremely subdued; her dialogue consists primarily of who, what, where, when, how or why. She appears to be more level-headed than her counterpart and does not partake in Alv`s jeering of other ES members. She is also averse to unnecessary bloodshed, as made apparent when she protects Chevalier from Alv on board the Deucalion. Dvergr`s motivations and intentions are never revealed, but unlike Alv, she is unwilling to abandon her partner and daughter.",
