  "description" : "Kid Buu (魔人ブウ （純粋） Majin Bū (Junsui), lit. \"Demon Person Boo (Pure)\") is the original, pure form of Majin Buu. Unlike his other forms, this form of Buu`s thought process is seen to be irrational and spontaneous, even destroying his own body to destroy the Earth. Although he appears smaller than any other form, he is more dangerous than any other forms of Buu due to his full relentless evil and unpredictability. He is also completely free of restraint and has no trace of sanity and, because of this, is extremely volatile. He retains his childish personality, becoming amused and laughing hysterically at his own destruction of entire worlds. He is the main antagonist for the Kid Buu Saga as well as the final antagonist of the Majin Buu Saga.\n(Source: http://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Kid_Buu)",
