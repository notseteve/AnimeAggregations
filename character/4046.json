  "description" : "The primary male protagonist of the series, he`s a fairly average person and he doesn`t fit the mold of the stereotypical male hero in most harem anime series.\nFor the most part, he`s shown to be a fairly good student, and isn`t prone to emotional outbursts unlike other leading males in harem anime.\nGenerally well liked and a member of the photography club at Meiritsu University, he harbours a deep dislike for the Hanabishi clan due to their inhumane treatment of himself and his mother.\nThis was due to the clan`s disapproval of his parents` relationship and resulted in Kaoru leaving the clan.\nKaoru`s mother and father never married, and he was an illegitimate child.\nHis back is scarred from when he was tortured with a bamboo cane for trying to prevent his grandfather from burning mementos of his dead mother.\nLiving alone in self-imposed exile up till now, he has led an average, if not lonely, life.\nWhen Aoi came he was, at first, perplexed at her visit, not remembering almost anything prior. The idea of marriage took him aback, but very quickly likes, and even eventually looks forward to it.",
