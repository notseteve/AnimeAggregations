  "description" : "Lombre is the larger evolved form of Lotad. Lombre is a nocturnal Pokémon found in the Hoenn region, whose lilypad, carried over from its Lotad stage, is now attached to its head like a hat. Lombre`s entire body is covered by a slippery, slimy film. It feels horribly unpleasant to be touched by this Pokémon`s hands. It feeds on aquatic moss that grows in the riverbed. It is also a mischief-maker: When a Lombre spots anglers, it will tug on their fishing lines from beneath the surface and enjoy their consternation. It also takes great delight in popping out of rivers and startling people.\nIn the Pokémon anime, the Lotad in trainer Brock`s possession during the third-generation Hoenn story arc evolves into a Lombre over time, and later on into a Ludicolo. As a Lombre, Brock`s is quirky and dense.",
