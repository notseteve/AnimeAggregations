  "description" : "Bagdash was an officer of the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Free Planets Alliance]. Initially aligned with the http://anidb.net/ch6225 [National Salvation Military Council], he later defected to the Alliance forces under http://anidb.net/ch737 [Yang Wenli]. Originally tasked with the assassination of Yang, he leaked false information about the movements of the NSMC http://anidb.net/ch96433 [11th Fleet] but was met with suspicion by http://anidb.net/ch748 [Walter von Sch√∂nkopf], who confined him to his tank bed during the Battle of Doria. After the battle, he grudgingly agreed to defect to Yang`s command, but was still distrusted by http://anidb.net/ch742 [Julian Mintz].\nNear the end of the Alliance Civil War, Bagdash gave a speech announcing that the NSMC had undertake the coup under the clandestine directions of the http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Galactic Empire]. Though Yang lacked physical evidence of the involvement of http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Reinhard von Lohengramm], the speech successfully damaged the morale of the junta, leading to http://anidb.net/ch794 [Arthur Lynch] confirming the existence of an Imperial plot.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
