  "description" : "Momoko is the first member of the Powerpuff Girls Z squad. She transforms using the phrase \"Hyper-Blossom\" and fights villains with a yo-yo. Like the original, she is the self-proclaimed leader of the team. She is a bit boy-crazy, and is an otaku (a nod to the original Blossom`s nerdy intelligence). She is very familiar with the maho shoujo genre, along with some typical anime/super sentai concepts and is famous for being a \"hero maniac\" in school, especially by Kaoru. Momoko also has a strong appetite for candies and other sweets, and spends much of her time snacking. Because of this, most of her attacks are named after food. In addition, she dislikes vegetables and is afraid of bugs and dentists. Although she can be easily distracted and has been known to whine, Momoko tries her best to protect Tokyo City, lead the girls, and help her friends regardless of her situation. Often she can be very clever and crafty when needed, usually being the first to come up with a plan to trick or defeat villains/monsters. She is the elder daughter of Hachizou and Kakiko Akadutsumi and has a younger sister named Kuriko. She is represented by hearts. She dreams of being married in the future.",
