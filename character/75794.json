  "description" : "Valerie is the Gym Leader of Laverre City Gym and she specializes in Fairy-type Pokémon. Trainers that defeat her receive the Fairy Badge. Valerie is also a well known clothes designer and she showcases her designs at her company store which also doubles as the gym. In the Japanese version, Mâche speaks in a kyo-kotoba dialect, commonly known as the Kyoto dialect.\nWhile Ash Ketchum and company were visiting the gym, Valerie was showcasing her Furisode Collection which featured an elegant dress with a Marilli pattern and dresses with Florges and Lisyan patterns which were worn by Serena and Bonnie respectfully. The original models could not make it so Valerie asked them to model for her.\nAs part of an established custom of her runway shows, Valerie picks one person to battle with. She chose Scottie and told him if he defeated her, she would give him a Gym badge. Unfortunately for Scottie, he was unable to defeat her but was grateful for the experience and vowed to return to defeat her.",
