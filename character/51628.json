  "description" : "Dr. Warumon is the Evilbees` inventor, he`s Dr. Cinnamon`s arch-rival. He spends his time building armies of evil bee clones and trying to take over the world. He also dabbles in foreign politics, provoking coups, that sort of thing. He`s always thwarted by TwinBee, of course. Probably the most evil man in the Universe. He also has a number of airships which invariably end up getting crashed.\nSource: Wikipedia",
