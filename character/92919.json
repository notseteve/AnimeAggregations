  "description" : "A bright, straightforward catgirl with an almost dog-like love for her master.\nAlongside her twin, Vanilla they both share the title of youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. She isn`t well-suited to thinking about complicated things, but makes up for it with pure unbridled friendliness. With energy to spare at all times, she tends to leap into action before fully thinking things through. Despite her clumsy moments, her go-getter attitude earns plenty of love anyway.\nChocola and Vanilla were found as strays on the side of the road by the Minadukis. A few days after being adopted, they became ill due to refusing to eat, but recovered after being taken to a clinic. Chocola fell in love with Kashou at this point as he stayed and comforted them when they were sick.",
