  "description" : "Kureha Touka a student who also happens to work at a shrine as a miko, or shinto priestess. Kureha is skilled in the art of archery, or kyuudou. She was transported to End Earth with Souma after they helped Mao defeat a monster. Upon their arrival, she was attacked by monsters and presumably died. Fortunately, she was revealed to be unscathed after Souma pulled out a sword from her body, the Spirit Sword Snow Moon Flower (霊剣 雪月華, Ryouken Setsu Getsu Ka). After Kiriya and Souma`s fight, she joins Kiriya and the other Luminous Knights. Kiriya can also draw a sword from her, the Spirit Sword Blazing Sunlight (霊剣 日輪烈光, Ryouken Nishirin Rekkou).\nKureha has feeling for Kiriya, but she never expresses them to him. In the end, she returns to her own world, together with Kiriya and Seena.\nSource: Wikipedia",
