  "description" : "The main protagonist of the series. He moved from his home in rural Hiroshima to his aunt`s dormitory in Tokyo to change himself. While checking out his new high school, he sees a beautiful high jumper practicing and falls in love at first sight. By chance she happens to be his next door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina. Yamato is clumsy and has a carefree attitude, which often gets him into comprising situations. He has an almost spineless attitude when it comes to defending his position on a subject when confronted and his need to apologize constantly when he thinks he did something wrong makes him a generally weak willed character. When the need arises, he can become focused and determined. He is exceedingly clueless when it comes to girls and their feelings except for the fact the Suzuka is not your typical girl and would be hard for anyone to read. Although not the best in academics, he discovered a natural gift as a sprinter, and joined the track and field team. During his senior year of high school, he became a well-liked and respected track captain.",
