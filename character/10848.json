  "description" : "The mother of Tenchi and Masaki Tennyo, as well as the younger sister of Masaki Minaho. Although she was a loving, kind person and an excellent cook (she had taught Masaki Rea how to cook), she also inherited the playful spirit of her mother Masaki Airi, such as pulling pranks and doing things in an outlandish fashion, which became extreme just before her death (she had once wrote `baka` on Seina`s forehead as the boy slept). She had even concocted a tale about how she died (with help from her mother Masaki Airi), however, the story made no sense whatsoever. In truth, she has died peacefully; at the age of 248 years.",
