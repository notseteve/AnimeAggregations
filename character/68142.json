  "description" : "Suzaku is a fire user like Guren. Unlike his destructive flames, Suzaku`s flames are used to purify evil spirits. He uses a heavy-bladed Zanbato to slash his enemies. Suzaku has bright red hair and wears a white strip of cloth around his forehead, which was Ten`itsu`s. He is very much in love with Ten`itsu and is fiercely protective of her due to her wound transfer ability, going as far as to hit Masahiro after Ten`itsu saved him.\nSource: Wiki",
