  "description" : "Kaidou Kaoru is known as \"Viper\" to his teammates, though Momoshiro prefers to call him \"Mamushi.\" He is known for constantly making a \"fshuuuu\", sound, similar to a snake, while exhaling. Kaidou trains rigorously, increasing the training program given to him by Inui to give him unbeatable endurance. He has a deep rivalry with Momoshiro, in which they constantly try to one-up each other. He normally plays singles, though he eventually pairs with Inui, who help Kaidou train at first.",
