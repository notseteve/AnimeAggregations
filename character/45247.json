  "description" : "A modified and improved version of the original MS-06D Zaku Desert Type, the MS-06D Desert Zaku features better power output, external propellant tanks on its backpack to carry extra thruster fuel, and additional shields and dust filters on its joints to facilitate burying the mobile suit under the sand for ambushes. The Desert Zaku can also be fitted with a pair of jet skis on its feet, making it easy to glide at high speed across the desert sand. Though normally used by Zeon remnants led by \"Desert\" Rommel in North Africa in U.C. 0088, a few Desert Zakus also land in the hands of the African Liberation Front, with one unit operating as part of their \"Blue Team\" and painted in their distinctive light-blue-on-blue colors. Zeon remnants continue to make use of the Desert Zaku as late as U.C. 0096 during an attack on Australia`s Torrington Base.\nSource: mahq.net",
