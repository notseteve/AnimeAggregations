  "description" : "Ash`s Greninja was first revealed in the October 2015 issue of Corocoro. Ash`s Greninja is the evolved form of Ash`s Frogadier and it takes on a mysterious new appearance in the latest season of Pocket Monsters XY&Z. Ash-Greninja is the form that Greninja takes when the bond between it and Ash is raised to the limit. The strength of their bond changes Greninja`s appearance and it takes on the characteristic look of Ash`s attire. This phenomenon is also said to have happened just once several hundred years ago in the Kalos region, but it remains shrouded in mystery.",
