  "description" : "Matako is the only female member of the Kiheitai and is skilled in using a pair of pistols. She is fiercely loyal to Takasugi, and appears to have a crush on him. She also gets angry and tells off Nizou after he goes on a rampage throughout Edo, trying to kill Takasugi`s old comrades.\nShe is quick-tempered and prone to screeching when she`s upset. This is evident when she has a \"spitting fight\" with Kagura after she spat at her and when she starts yelling at Kagura after her underwear is said to be stained. She shoots Kagura through the shoulder when Kagura breaks onto the ship. She interacts the most with Takechi, calling him `senpai` and also calling him a `pervert` and a `lolicon` for sparing Kagura instead of killing her.\nAt the end of the Benizakura arc, she is wounded by Okada after he loses control, and that is her last appearance.",
