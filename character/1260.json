  "description" : "Gliscor, known as the Fang Scorp Pokémon, is the evolved form of Gligar. Gligar evolves into Gliscor when it is holding a Razor Fang and levels up at night. Gliscor appears to be a combination of a vampire and a more sinister form of Gligar whose limbs are seemingly independent of its bat-like wings and a narrow waist. It has two fully developed pincers for hands and has two barbs on its tail, as opposed to Gligar`s one, giving its tail the resemblance of vampire`s fangs. It is also one of the few Pokémon who can not learn STAB attacks through leveling-up, only through TMs.\nIn the Anime, Paul is seen catching a Gliscor, which was the leader of a group of Gligars. Ash`s Gligar eventually evolves into Gliscor.",
