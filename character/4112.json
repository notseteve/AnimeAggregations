  "description" : "She was at one time Mikura`s best friend, was a child of the streets. She and Mikura would survive by stealing for their food, until they got separated when Mikura ran interference against then-detective Kurokawa. Sakura`s life afterward went on a downward spiral, trying to achieve the same. Then one night as she was about to be raped by three men, she was rescued by Momomi Momoi - a character introduced in the original OVA as the psychotic daughter of antagonist Momokichi Momoi - who singlehandedly killed the rapists.\nSince then, Sakura and Momomi became lesbian lovers, and Momomi had taught Sakura how to fight and defend herself. Sakura often described Momomi as beautiful as she is terrifying. Sakura was deeply in love with Momomi, so when she found out that Momomi was killed by Mikura, she set out to get revenge by killing Mikura. However, many of her early attempts were unsuccessful because Kurokawa and Harada, who were on an unrelated case, interfered. When she finally did make an attempt on Mikura`s life, she ended up accidentally stabbing herself. As Sakura was dying, she had told Mikura that she found out that Momomi and Mikura were actually half-sisters (this was hinted at in Mezzo Forte). As she was about to die, an android (who was about to self-destruct, again from Kurokawa and Harada`s case) came crashing out of a window. Hallucinating from her wounds, Sakura thought it was Momomi coming to embrace her. Sakura died when the android blew up.",
