  "description" : "Commander Amarao works for the department of Interstellar Immigration, a men in black like agency. This agency, among other things, acts as a middle man for negotiations between the government and Medical Mechanica. Amarao has fake eyebrows made of nori which he believes serve the dual purpose of protecting him from N.O. and making him look macho. Amarao seems to have had a past relationship with Haruko similar to Naota`s. There are some traces of him feeling jealous that Haruko has chosen Naota over him.\nHe first appears in the fourth episode of the series, giving viewers the impression that he is virtually an omniscient character, giving background information as well as making fairly accurate predictions. However, subsequent events would show him as extremely weak and very limited in foresight, though he seems to grasp what is happening better than almost all the other characters.\nHe has a love for sickeningly sweet candy and drinks (which he claims will help people`s heads back to normal), and hates spicy, sour, and pulpy foods — much like Naota. His vehicle of choice is a Fuji Rabbit, a motor scooter which was initially produced in 1946 six months prior to the initial production of the Vespa. Given that throughout the series Amarao is constantly trying to impress Haruko, who rides a Vespa, one could conclude his ownership of a scooter is a further manifestation of his attempts to impress her — or at the very least a signal to the level at which Haruko influenced him in his youth.",
