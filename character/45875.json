  "description" : "Georgia`s Vanilluxe was first seen at a port city near Tachiwaki City where the Tesseed Laboratories is located. Georgia`s Vanilluxe instantly took a liking to Iris`s Axew despite the fact that Iris`s Axew didn`t like Ice type Pokémon. While on the fourth floor of the Tesseed Laboratories, it went after Iris`s Axew again and chased it to the roof. Ash`s Oshawott really seemed to like Georgia`s Vanilluxe but it wasn`t interested in it. After Georgia`s Vanilluxe was able to help rescue Iris and the other from the roof of the lab, Iris and Iris`s Axew`s opinion towards Ice type Pokémon changed and they asked Georgia to thank it.",
