  "description" : "Krabby is a crab with large pincers. Krabby is an omnivore and a scavenger; it rarely hunts for itself. It can also act as a filter feeder by digesting the bacteria in sand, but this is rare. It is territorial, and in beaches where there is little food, fights between Krabby are common. Krabby also uses camouflage; it can form mucus sacs about itself if threatened, making it seem larger or making it harder to spot against sea sand. It is usually very small, but it makes up by its aggressiveness.\nKrabby first appeared at a beach in episode 13, Mystery At The Lighthouse, when Ash Ketchum wanted to prove that he could catch a Pokémon alone. After the capture (which involved Krabby attacking Ash`s finger), it was automatically transferred to Professor Oak`s lab, because Ash already had six Pokémon with him. To Ash`s great surprise, Gary had also caught another Krabby, which was much larger than his. Ash used Krabby in his first battle at the Indigo Tournament. Krabby won against an Exeggutor and evolved into Kingler, despite the fact that Krabby had never battled before.",
