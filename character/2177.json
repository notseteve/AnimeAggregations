  "description" : "Helmsman of the S.M.S. mothership, SMS Macross Quarter. Somewhat stern in appearance, he is \"just like a girl inside\", as he often says. He was a hair stylist, as well as a make-up artist, somewhere in the past. He is well-liked by female crew members for his good understanding of others. He is an open homosexual and has not-so subtle feelings for Ozma, though he claims to be \"Way beyond the point in life where [he] needs [his] love to be reciprocated.\"",
