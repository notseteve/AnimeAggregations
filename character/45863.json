  "description" : "Kenso`s Mienshao and Kenso`s Watchog had a double battle against Suwama`s Heatmor and Suwama`s Emboar at the Astilbe Town Battle Club. The battle with Suwama didn`t last very long but it garnered a lot of attention as they were both quickly overpowered after using their initial attacks. Suwama`s Heatmor knocked them both to the ground and then Suwama`s Emboar knocked them both out at the same time with a powerful Hammer Arm.\nDouble Battle against Ash`s Tepig and Ash`s Snivy\nAsh wanted to prove to Suwama that Tepig was a strong Pok√©mon and they decided to have a battle with Ash`s Tepig as the focus. Ash`s Tepig didn`t battle until Ash`s Snivy ended up getting knocked out. Right after that though, Ash`s Tepig evolved into Ash`s Pignite. After Ash`s Pignite defeated Suwama, Suwama realized how much stronger Ash`s Pignite had become and he tried to get it to join him again thinking that it would want to rejoin him despite the fact that he had rejected him a second time the day before. Ash`s Pignite pretended that he was interested for a few moments before blowing fire into Suwama`s face. Suwama ran off in psychotic pain while telling Ash`s Pignite to remember him.",
