  "description" : "Ghim is a dwarven warrior who is exclusively a fighter, and has in his possession what appears to be a Battle Axe of Returning, an axe which he can throw, and will return to him after each throw, as his axe always returns after being thrown.\nIt is never hinted at as to what the age of Ghim is, but judging from his appearance, he seems somewhat old, and could be between the ages of 175 and 220.\nGhim`s purpose is apparent right from the beginning of the series, as he is looking for a girl who is like a daughter to him and wishes to get her back from her kidnappers.\nHe is devoted to Neese, the high priestess of Marfa, the goddess of all creation and acts as a father figure for Leylia, Neese`s adopted daughter, and a priestess of Marfa herself.\nGhim becomes a sort of mentor for Parn, teaching him how to hold his weapon, as well as how to wield it. He teaches Parn what he is able to, but ultimately allows King Kashue to take on the role of his teacher, when Parn`s studies would need to be furthered by someone who actually uses a sword.\n(Wikipedia)",
