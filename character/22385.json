  "description" : "Nastina is the cousin of Brutella. Nastina often gets confused for her cousin and she gets upset when people confuser her. She has a very grouchy personality and she doesn`t get along very well with people.\nNastina was creating a grand resort area called Paradise Obaba which she was the president of. She thought that her resort would be better than the resort that Brutella was making in Aopulco because inside the main structure is a suite room surrounded by the world`s most beautiful coral reef but a bunch of disruptive Menokurage kept getting in the way of construction and all the tourists were going to Aopulco. She had a standing reward of 1,000,000 yen, a year`s worth of hotel stays and fine dinners around the world for a year for the person that could get rid of the Menokurage.\nAsh and his friends found out that the resort was being built on the coral reef where the Menokurage lived and that`s why they were upset. The resort ended up being destroyed and Nastina was sent flying all the way to Aopulco where she landed right beside her cousin Brutella who was rebuilding.",
