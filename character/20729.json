  "description" : "Mishima Eiji is a young boy from Shingetsu Village who wants to take revenge against Shishio`s forces, who killed Eiji`s parents and brother, http://anidb.net/ch20728 [Mishima Eiichirou]. Saitou Hajime sent Eiichirou to Shingetsu to investigate the incidents there, hoping that he would not raise suspicion; Eiichirou`s cover was blown, and he failed to save his parents. Kenshin defeats Senkaku, who killed Eiichirou and Eiji`s parents, and Shishio and his forces leave. At that point Eiji tries to kill Senkaku with a sword; Saitou appears and stops Eiji. When Eiji insists that Senkaku needs to be killed in his family`s honor, Kenshin tells Eiji that his dead family wants him to be happy, not for him to kill someone. Saitou arranges for his wife, Tokio, to care for Eiji in the near future.\nWatsuki created Eiji as the process of the tragedy in Mishima Village and the concept of a new beginning. Eiji`s main theme is revenge. In retrospect Watsuki wishes that Eiji developed as a character since he felt the plot pulled Eiji in its own direction. Watsuki used no model in Eiji`s design, as he had a lack of time. Watsuki at first created a \"slightly long-haired\" boy, but Watsuki whited out the design when he believed that it did not appear to be a village boy. Then Watsuki drew the final version. The first design appears in a panel in the initial weekly magazine version of the story; it was corrected for the graphic novel version. Since Watsuki had a lack of time, he asked his assistants to put a pattern on Eiji`s shirt and a tone on Eiji`s trousers. Watsuki felt the design looked too similar to Yahiko`s design.",
