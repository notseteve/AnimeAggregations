  "description" : "Serena`s Sylveon is the evolved form of Serena`s Eevee. It`s evolution was first hinted at with an ad from the karaoke company Cote d`Azur.\nDuring a Double Battle against James` Inkay and Miette`s Slurpuff at the dance party battle round hosted by Monsieur Pierre, Serena`s Eevee was knocked down along with Pikachu. Serena, who was worried for it, came over to give her Eevee some strength and during that time it began to evolve. It wrapped its ribbon-like feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer Serena and learned the move Fairy Wind in the process. Serena`s Sylveon was able to fight back and win the match.",
