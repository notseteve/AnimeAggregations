  "description" : "This land warfare mobile suit. is a radical improvement over the Zaku II and Gouf. While its predecessors were limited to travelling on foot or making brief rocket-assisted jumps, the jet engines in the Dom`s legs turn it into a high-speed hovercraft. With its maneuverability, heavy armor, and powerful bazooka, the Dom is almost unbeatable in ground combat. When Zeon`s dreaded \"Black Tri-Stars\" use this new model to attack the immobilized White Base, our heroes are hard-pressed to fight them off.",
