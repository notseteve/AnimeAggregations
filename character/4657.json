  "description" : "Paife, like Honoka, does freelance work for the Emporium Administration. On the side, she also works as a nurse at the school Millie attends. Paife has sort of a mixed personality. On one hand, she`s the tough-talking, gun-slinging, heavy-drinking kind of woman you`d picture her to be. On the other hand, she`s got a playful streak that she only reveals in Honoka`s company. Unfortunately for Iks, she takes an immediate disliking to him, declaring that she \"hates men.\"",
