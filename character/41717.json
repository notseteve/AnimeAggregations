  "description" : "The AAC Banshee is a nuclear-powered airborne aircraft carrier and mother ship. The first two prototypes, Banshee I and Banshee II, were ground-based and used to prove the platform systems. Banshee III and Banshee IV were commissioned as AAC-03 and AAC-04 respectively. As with naval aircraft carriers, the Banshee platform serves as a mother ship deploying a host of smaller aircraft providing umbrella air cover over a wide area. One unique feature of the Banshee is that it is not expected to ever land during normal operation. Nuclear-powered as they are, the Banshees operate as semi-permanent satellites of Fairy.\nThe Banshee is broadly divided into 3 decks: top, middle and lower. The top deck houses anti-aircraft batteries, the command and control centres and the crew quarters. In addition to the residential areas, the living quarters include cafeterias and medical facilities, and the overall standard of living is relatively high.\nThe middle deck contains hangars, the propulsion systems and the take-off and landing bays. The runway is mounted in the centre of the fuselage. The landing arrestor system works by snagging the front wheel of fighter and transport aircraft and an internal counterbalance is used to avoid sudden changes in the centre of gravity when a large craft lands/takes off. The lower deck houses anti-aircraft batteries, the nuclear reactors, more hangars and more take-off bays.\nOriginal plans called for the operation of 4 airborne Banshee-class ships, but construction budget delays and the observation that two Banshees were sufficient to defend FAF airspace led to the cancellation of Banshee V and Banshee VI.\nTechnical Specifications\nManufacturer: Fairy Air Force (FAF)\nTotal Length: 687m\nTotal Width: 1,400m\nWeight: 409,650t\nPropulsion: Nuclear-powered turbofan engine x16",
