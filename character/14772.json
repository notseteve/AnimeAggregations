  "description" : "Pierre is a popular and handsome boy at Chocolat`s school, but he has a cold heart, and is not as innocent as he looks. He`s the captain of the fencing and tennis teams of the school and has a fan club of beautiful but cruel and cold junior-high student girls known as `The Members`, who apparently dislike Chocolat being near their Prince. Almost nobody can resist his charisma and charm. He has white blonde hair and piercing, sharp ice blue eyes\nIt is discovered in Volume 2, that Pierre is also from the magical world. Although, he isn`t a witch, but is part of the clan called \"Ogre\", he`s their prince. As the story goes on, Pierre begins to fall in love with Chocolat and eventually, (after losing his heart) his heart turns white.",
