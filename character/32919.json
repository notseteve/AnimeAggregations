  "description" : "Mei Mei is an outsider just like Ikuto. Her family worked as traveling performers, but she kept messing up and embarked on a journey that got her to the island. She is very shy and reclusive, to the point where she is forced to illustrate her thoughts through drawings and she cannot talk to a stranger unless she is wearing a disguise (usually a large tree costume) though she eventually discards this habit. She befriended the kappa, Tohno, during her travels, and the creature has accompanied her to the island. She develops feelings for Ikuto after he fought for her so she would not get taken away by Tiger, who wanted her to become the North Leader. She apparently began reading erotic novels according to Tohno and began having strange fantasies about Ikuto whenever something such as kissing or bathing is mentioned. She trains regularly in acrobatic skills such that she has shown almost superhuman levels of agility and flexibility. She is quite intelligent as during examination day at school she managed to get a perfect score on every subject.",
