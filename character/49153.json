  "description" : "Like the male Zentradi, the female Meltlandi were also enslaved by the Mardook and forced to fight in their wars. However, unlike the vehicles of the enslaved Zentrandi, the Meltlandi Powered Suit is a completely new design. The primary armament of this new battle suit is a beam lance and the large engines suggest the suit is designed for high mobility. Meltlandi Powered Suits were encountered by UN Forces many times during the Mardook Invasion of 2092.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross2/meltrandipoweredsuit.htm",
