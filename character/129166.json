  "description" : "Goh`s Flabébé (White Flower) was caught outside the stadium at the Battle Festival Challenge in Shalour City at the end of the day. Gurkinn told Goh that White Flower Flabébé are extremely hard to find and that he hasn`t seen any around there. He then spotted it later in the day and was very surprised to see it.\nOne day at the Cerise Park, Goh noticed that it had lost one of the petals on its flower and couldn`t float properly anymore. He took it to the Kalos region to get a new flower. It then evolved into Goh`s Floette (White Flower) after getting a new flower and learning the move Grassy Terrain.",
