  "description" : "Edmond participated in the Don George Donamite Tournament. He faced Stephan in the first round. Freddy called Edmond the gray, cloudy rain man and just as his battle was about to start, clouds appeared and it started to rain. His personality seems somewhat creepy and dark similar to how it is on a gloomy and rainy day. Edmond`s Seismitoad is a perfect match for him as it Ability is Swift Swim so when it rains, its speed increases. Since Edmond seems to be able to summon rain, Edmond`s Seismitoad greatly benefits.\nInitially the battle went well as Edmond`s Seismitoad `s speed made it hard for Stephan`s Sawk to hit it. The two Pok√©mon began having a rally of heavy blows, trying to stop one another but it wasn`t until Stephan`s Sawk successfully hit it with a Low Sweep and injured it a bit, that Edmond`s Seismitoad `s speed decreased. Edmond noted that with its speed, it should be able to dodge attacks but the injury proved to be the turning point in the match and Stephan`s Sawk was able to Bulk Up and then finished it with a Close Combat. Edmond was eliminated from the Don George Donamite Tournament by Stephan in the first round.",
