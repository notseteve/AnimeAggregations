  "description" : "Shokuhou Misaki is a mysterious Level 5 Tokiwadai student that goes under the alias The Queen. Her ability is Mental Out, the ultimate form of telepathy which includes reading other people`s memories, changing a person`s personality by means of brainwashing, telepathy, memory elimination, amplification of will, reproduction of thought and transplantation of emotions. She appears to activate this ability using a remote control-like device. However, this power does not work on people with electromagnetic properties, such as Mikoto.\nAs one of the two Level 5s of Tokiwadai, her followers have a rivalry with Mikoto`s fans. Despite this, she is in good terms with Mikoto.\nShe rarely shows herself in public, instead using her followers or mind controlled people to act as her representatives when talking with individuals.\nSource: wiki",
