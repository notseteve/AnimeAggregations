  "description" : "Charmandertwo is a clone of Charmander and is the result of an experiment conducted by Dr. Fuji and a team of Team Rocket scientists.\nDespite never gaining consciousness, Charmandertwo managed to communicate with Bulbasaurtwo, Squiertletwo, Mewtwo and Ambertwo via telepathy.\nCharmandertwo enjoyed spending time in Ambertwo`s \"Remember Place\" before suddenly dissapearing in front of Mewtwo and Ambertwo. This was because Charmandertwo had perished in the experiment chamber in the real world.\n(Charmandertwo had markings over its body, which seems to mean it is a superior clone like the Charizard that Mewtwo cloned on New Island. Because Charmandertwo can communicate using telepathy, this may mean that it has some kind of psychic ability.)",
