  "description" : "Dewpider is a dual-type Water/Bug Pokémon.\nIt evolves into Araquanid starting at level 22.\nDewpider is a Pokémon resembling a spider. The most prominent feature of Dewpider is the water bubble that covers its head, which is anchored to the thorax by the means of three thin, green projections. The bubble serves as a means of protection to Dewpider`s soft head and allows it to breathe when on land. When this Pokémon comes across enemies or potential prey, it slams its bubble-covered head into them. Dewpider has a large, gray face with large blue oval-shaped eyes. It has two small blue spikes on its forehead and a yellow mouth. Dewpider`s body is primarily light green with three thin, green legs, and a gray abdomen with a small stinger on the bottom.",
