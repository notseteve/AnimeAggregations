  "description" : "Baron Leltoy (original version Baron Rich (バロン・リッチ)) is the youngest member of the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance. He battles using the Haos attribute. He is one of Dan`s biggest fans. He has spiky pink/purple hair with a red headband over it. He uses Piercian as his Bakugan Trap.\nBeing the youngest, Baron has a lot to learn. He may be a talented Brawler, but he has a bad habit of getting too defensive or not attacking properly. Baron is also shown to know a lot about the Bakugan Battle Brawlers- he knows almost all of them and Mira even claims that Baron has a poster of them in his room (where or how he got it is never mentioned, although the Bakugan Battle Brawlers seem to be very well known in New Vestroia).\nDespite being the youngest, Baron is more muscular-looking than the other members of the Bakugan Brawler`s Resistance.\nAlthough he is called the weak compared to some of the other members of the Resistance, he has managed to defeat Volt Luster, Shadow Prove, Lync Volan and also somewhat helped Dan defeat Mylene Pharaoh. Baron has been shown to be a bit too fascinated with things and is easily amazed. He also ends up humiliating himself sometimes. Baron has also been shown to be a bit more immature than the other Brawlers (even Dan finds him strange).\nSource: bakugan.wikia.com",
