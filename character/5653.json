  "description" : "Mashiro Rima replaces Nadeshiko as the new Queen`s Chair. Although Rima is the same age as Amu, she is extremely petite and has relatively poor athletic ability. Most of the boys in her class admire her because of her beauty and passive personality, while the girls are annoyed by her because of her selfishness.\nBecause of a kidnapping incident that happened before she transferred to Seiyo Elementary, her parents pick her up after school, but since it interferes with their work schedules, they often argue about who cares more for Rima over work, resulting in Rima often having no one but Kusukusu as company for her secret interest in gag comedy.",
