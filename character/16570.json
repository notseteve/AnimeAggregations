  "description" : "Kamiki Seto Jurai is the mother of Second Empress Misaki and the adopted mother of Noike Jurai (grandmother of Ayeka and Sasami), and is a very powerful `behind the scenes` figure in Jurai politics among the royal family. A survivor of the pirate raid of the Jurai Royal Science Academy post on planet K-1190 over 5,000 years prior to GXP, Seto was adopted by the Kamiki family, and retains an intense hatred of pirates. She is married to the Kamiki clan`s head, Utsutsumi Kamiki.\nBecause of her political craftiness, and occasionally violent temper, she has been referred to as the \"Devil Princess of Jurai\". Seto, has also a reputation as an unofficial \"matchmaker\" in the Jurai empire. She has been known to arrange marriages, either to cement alliances or just to see happens for her own amusement.\nSource: Wikipedia",
