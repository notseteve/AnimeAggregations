  "description" : "Seismitoad, known as the Vibration Pokémon, is the final evolution of Tympole. According to the Pokédex, they shoot paralyzing liquid from their head bumps. They use vibration to hurt their opponents. Their vibration also increases the power of their punches. With a single punch, a boulder can be turned into a pile of rubble.\nIt is the only Water-type Pokémon with a double weakness to Grass to learn no damage dealing Ice-type moves. Instead of Ice-type moves though, Seismitoad can be taught Poison-type moves such as Sludge Wave to fend off Grass-types.",
