  "description" : "Kawarazaki Naoki is http://anidb.net/ch10262 [Keita]`s senpai at school and a dedicated otaku. He pursues http://anidb.net/ch10241 [Youko] as he wants to use her as a model for a doujinshi character, but unfortunately makes the mistake of complimenting her tail for its plumpness and comparing it to a tanuki`s. Apparently, Inukami admire thin tails. He is a cosplay maniac, who enjoys seeing both men and women of any age dressed in \"moe\" female clothing. Kawarazaki is the first to name and organize the citizens of the darkness in the battle against http://anidb.net/ch10272 [Sekidousai]. He sometimes comes off as a pervert or psycho, (such as when he chases http://anidb.net/ch10261 [Tomohane] around the entire city to use her as a model), but his intentions are always good, earning him respect from Keita and Youko.",
