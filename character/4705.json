  "description" : "Chisame is a cynical observer of the odd goings on in 2-A, placing herself above the standard zaniness inherent of a gaggle of teenaged girls being led by a preteen boy. Her classmates view her as reserved and surly... though the rest of the world may have a slightly different opinion. When Chisame retires to her room and whips off the nerdy glasses, she leads a surprising double-life as the legendary net idol Chiu! Using her computer smarts and web savvy, Chisame rides a wave of sexy costumes and online journals to the #1 spot in internet popularity polls! That is, until a group of cute and fresh contenders makes quite a stir with their new homepage!",
