  "description" : "Hobbies: Tinkering with Magic Items\nLeon Royal Capital Shop`s engineer. She`s in charge of repairs and the air conditioner. Fundamentally, she`s quite, but she becomes very talkative when it concerns machines and technology. However, when that happens she starts using difficult technical terms and verbose phrases. She stays calm no matter what, and expresses little emotion. It`s hard to tell what she`s thinking. Usually she`s out on her personal carriage to conduct repairs, so she`s rarely in the store. Her technical skill is solid, and Raul and the others look up to her as their senior.\nSource: ANN",
