  "description" : "She is on the Jacinthe when the Neo Terrors put their plan into action.\nsource: Kangoku Senkan volume one dvd\nShe is a Space Federation Force major, from Planet Titan, and in the New Soral faction.\nShe is an investigator for the Armed Forces Military Police Investigative Department and Lieri Bishop`s adjutant. Her specialty is in operating the self-propulsion robotic soldier called the \"gunturtle,\" which is said to be extremely difficult to learn. Naomi is a genius that can operate four machines at one time. She also excels at close-quarters combat and has twice been champion of a hand-to-hand fighting tournament on Titan.\nFrom the outset, she was the eldest daughter of a mercantile family that dealt with the Bishop family, but starting from when she was a child, she has grown alongside Lieri and followed after Lieri on the path as a servicewoman. Needless to say, she enrolled in the same military academy as Lieri. Lieri is Naomi`s respected senior, and Naomi loves her like an actual elder sister.\nDue to Lieri`s influence, she is of the old collective ideology that the Neo Terrors are savage and uncivilized.\nBecause of her excellence, she is high-handed and tends to look down on men and has caused much trouble with male servicemen.\nsource: official website`s character page, translated by lf412",
