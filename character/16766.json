  "description" : "Kaede often \"breaks the fourth wall\" to, represent the viewer as the new person into the world of Shinobu and the ninja. As a consequence she is the most aware that she is in an anime, frequently remarking, \"What was that scene about??\" and in the first episode saying, \"It`s only episode 1, I don`t want to die yet!\" She is often seen making remarks about Onsokumaru and the male ninja, such as \"That does not make sense.\" and \"You are talking rubbish again!\".",
