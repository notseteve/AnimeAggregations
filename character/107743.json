  "description" : "Falinks is a Fighting-type Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.\nA single Falinks is a formation of six individuals: five troopers and \"the brass\". Falinks usually march in a single file line headed by the brass, giving their formation the appearance of myriapod. However, Falinks occasionally break their formation to attack. Falinks is the only known Pokémon capable of using No Retreat. Falinks are genderless and have no visible mouths.\nAn individual Falinks trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. A Falinks trooper has blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as having white pupils or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. The shell is topped with a red crest that terminates in an anterior horn and flanks the lateral sides of the trooper with two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields also features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail.\nThe Falinks brass is larger than its five troopers. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass`s golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass`s lateral shields are opposable. When Falinks is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face. The brass`s shield are often chipped or nicked.",
