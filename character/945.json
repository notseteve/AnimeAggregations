  "description" : "Loudred is a Pokémon species that is the larger and stronger form that the Whismur species takes when going through Pokémon evolution. A Loudred builds power by stamping the ground while shouting. After Loudred finishes shouting, it becomes incapable of hearing anything for a while, which is considered a weak point. Loudred`s bellowing can decimate a wood-frame house and its subsequent shockwaves can turn over a truck. It only needs to use its voice to punish its foes. Its round ears serve as loudspeakers, and they are positioned to assail foes with ultrasonic waves at massive volume. Loudred are also immune to Jigglypuff`s and Wigglytuff`s song.",
