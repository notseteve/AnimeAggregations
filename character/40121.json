  "description" : "Koriko is the fictional town by the sea where most of the story of http://anidb.net/a286 [Majo no Takkyuubin] takes place.\nhttp://anidb.net/cr40 [Miyazaki] has noted that the real town of Visby in Gotland, Sweden is the main visual inspiration for the city. Fictional Koriko is much larger than Visby; however in the real Visby you can clearly see the unusual tall medieval city walls, the center of the city raised on a hill, and of course the clock-tower in the center. Generally the buildings and shops of Koriko have the look of Stockholm, or the old town of a Central European city such as Munich.\nIn the anime, the name of the town is shown only once at the side of a bus but many visible texts are in Swedish.",
