  "description" : "A demon doctor who is very small. Lamia comes to the human world in her capacity as Dr. Rachmaninoff`s assistant to help in treating baby Beel and later takes care of Oga`s wounds after a confrontation with a demon. Like her boss, she can read minds, even baby Beel`s, although she does not do it very often. She disapproves of Oga as Beel`s parent, but reluctantly accepts it after his battle with Toujou. Although she seemed cold and hostile upon their first encounter, she thanks Oga for saving her after the incident in the demon world. She is very protective of Baby Beel and greatly respects Hilda, whom she refers to as \"Hilda-nee-san.\" Her name is possibly an allusion to the mythological demon. Later in the series, she seeks Furuichi`s help to find Lord En on Hilda`s request. Furuichi suspects her of being a tsundere character. Lamia carries a pistol loaded with bullets containing demonic concoctions that can erase memories, force a person to do one`s bidding or, in the case of Oga, trap him in a psychic loop. She is always accompanied by two small muumuu pets, one of which sits atop her head and often mimics her mood. Her age is unspecified, but her appearance is that of a pre-teen girl. Her mother is general Laymia of the 34th Pillar Squad.",
