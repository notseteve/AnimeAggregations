  "description" : "Kaleido-Ruby is a http://anidb.net/t2503 [magical girl] version of http://anidb.net/ch241 [Toosaka Rin]. Rin becomes Kaleido-Ruby when she wields the http://anidb.net/ch54376 [Kaleidostick Ruby], one of the inventions of http://anidb.net/ch40592 [Kischur Zelretch Schweinorg].\nThe Kaleidostick`s ability is to gather prana and knowledge from \"versions\" of the wielder in alternate dimensions (parallel universes), effectively giving the \"current dimension\" version large sources of both, but it comes with a catch: the Kaleidostick is a sentient wand that profoundly dislikes its creator, and it likes to place its wielder into humiliating situations; for Rin, this manifests as dressing her up as a magical girl.\nThe wand works through evocation of the Second True Magic, of which little is known other than the fact it operates with parallel universes, that Zelretch is the living person to best understand it and even he cannot fully grasp it, that not even http://anidb.net/ch1906 [the only known Servant from the future] fully understands it, that a few Nasuverse techniques and some of Zelretch`s inventions use it, and that Rin attempts to learn about it over the course of one of the routes in the http://anidb.net/a3348 [Fate/Stay Night] visual novel and afterwards; the events of the Fate/Hollow Ataraxia visual novel are triggered, among other things, by her spectacular failure at a Second True Magic experiment.",
