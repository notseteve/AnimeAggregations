  "description" : "Sango is the older Himeyuri twin. She is one school year younger than the protagonist, and helped develop the next generation maid gynoids for Kurusugawa Electronics. While she is quite bright in the technical aspect, to others, she seems quite naive and almost childish. Despite her childish attitude, Sango appears to be the \"older sister\" of the pair and often gives advice to her twin sister, Ruri. Both her and Ruri, speak with an extremely strong Kansai dialect.",
