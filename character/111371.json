  "description" : "Founded and commanded the Rōshigumi (浪士組, meaning \"the rōnin squad\") in 1862, a group of 234 masterless samurai (rōnin). Loyal to the Bakufu, they were supposed to act as the protectors of the Tokugawa shōgun, but were disbanded upon their arrival in Kyoto, Japan in 1863. They were the precursor of the Shinsengumi (新選組, \"New Select Brigade\"), an infamous special police force active between 1863 and 1869.\nhttp://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Kiyokawa_Hachiro",
