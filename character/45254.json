  "description" : "A Newtype- and Cyber Newtype-use mobile suit intended for mass production in the last weeks of the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-015 Geymalk is one of the pinnacles of Neo Zeon`s Newtype weaponry development. In terms of firepower alone, the Geymalk is one of the most heavily-armed mobile suits of its time, with over 20 beam weapons mounted on a single, regular-sized mobile suit body. In addition to this high number of weapons, the Geymalk is also equipped with a psycommu system, allowing its Newtype pilot to control its two large \"mother\" funnels. The mother funnels are actually bits in principle, since they have their own onboard reactor for power and don`t need to return to the Geymalk to be recharged. While each mother funnel mounts a mega particle gun, they each also carry 14 \"child\" funnels, which are normal-style funnels which recharge aboard the mother funnels. With this second tier of remote control, the Geymalk`s pilot can conduct all-range attacks at extremely long ranges. The pilot`s commands are relayed via a large psycommu control antenna on the Geymalk`s head, which relay the commands to the mother funnels, which in turn relay the commands to the child funnels. This advanced remote weapon system, combined with the mobile suit`s tremendous firepower, make the Geymalk one of the most powerful mobile suits ever conceived at its time. Only one unit is known to have been built, operated by Haman Karn loyalist Chara Soon during the last days of the war when Neo Zeon is being torn apart by internal conflicts. Chara demonstrates the Geymalk`s abilities when she almost single-handedly destroys an entire squadron of powerful, genetically-engineered Ple Two clones operating funnel-equipped AMX-004G Qubeley Mass Production Types.\nSource: mahq.net",
