  "description" : "Maka is Soul`s meister. They live together in an appartment in Death City, though Maka seems to be the one doing most of the household chores such as cooking. Where Soul seems to be the brawn, Maka is the brain. She always tries to think of a way to beat their opponent by exploiting the opponent`s weaknesses. Maka and Soul make an efficient team, as shown at the start of the series when they had already claimed ninety-nine evil souls. Maka is a dedicated student at Shibusen, and scored highest of her class during doctor Stein`s test. Maka`s father is Shinigami`s current death scythe and her mother was a very powerful scythe meister. They are currently divorced. While she adores her mother, Maka`s relationship with her father is strained. She seems to hate him for constantly flirting with other women (which caused the divorce). Deep down she still loves him though.",
