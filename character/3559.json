  "description" : "Hinako is ten years old at first but becomes eleven in the course of the story. She is in love with Shuusuke from when he saved her from three bullies who took her bag and would not give it back. She seems to want to learn how to be the girl he will like and asks Sana and Aoi for help. Hinako has a personality comparable to Aoi`s, however being only in the fifth grade, she is childish as a result of her age.",
