  "description" : "As the Gryps Conflict nears its end, Titan field commander Bask Om scrambles to organize an elite combat team made up of artificially-enhanced Cyber-Newtypes. The team`s members are equipped with this transformable mobile armour, whose eccentric appearance belies its surprising combat effectiveness and high performance. Armed with a beam sabre and oversized grappling claws, the Baund Doc has excellent close combat abilities even in its streamlined mobile armour form, as well as a devastating mega particle cannon. Three prototype units were produced, the first one a two-seater model with a monitoring station for Newtype researcher Loren Nakamoto.",
