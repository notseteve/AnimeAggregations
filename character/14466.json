  "description" : "The second tallest of the Gangreen Gang. Snake`s reimagining is a far cry from his original incarnation. Snake has a father, who appears to be involved in some high position or profession. Snake ends his sentence with `su` and will occasionally toss in English phrases. He appears to be the least confident of the Gangreen Gang. He does, however, have a lot of respect for Ace as he considers Ace to be the only true leader of the gang. (It was also implied that he & Ace have an intimate relationship, but that seems to be kept a secret to the public). Snake is very good at massaging and will use it to hypnotize his enemies.",
