  "description" : "Philip is a Power Plant worker in Gunjo City (グンジョシティ). His name is based off the author Philip K. Dick who wrote the book \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", which is a pun of the episode title Do Coil Dream of Electric Mice!? (コイルはでんきネズミのユメをみるか!?) which Philip appears in. His name was confirmed in the Japanese closed captions for that episode.\nWith his co-worker Dick, they went to investigate the cause of the power outage which ended up being a large group of Grimer`s who were clogging up the tunnels where the water for the generators flowed. With Ash and Pikachu`s help, Philip and Dick were able to get the power plant up and running once again.",
