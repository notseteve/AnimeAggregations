  "description" : "Prince Hata is a Squat-like, purple alien prince who is fond of animals. His fondness is not reciprocated, and one of his \"pets\" had even bitten his antenna off (it grew back later). He has an eccentric habit of collecting rare pets, but as he is incompetent in managing them, they often cause havoc in Edo. The Prince is often known as \"Baka Ouji\" (Stupid Prince) due to his simple-mindedness and lack of responsibility with his animal collection. He is a recurring character in the series. In the anime his appearance is usually followed by a Swiss-inspired theme song.",
