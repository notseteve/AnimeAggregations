  "description" : "Lickilicky, known as the Licking Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolve from a Pokémon from a previous generation, Lickitung. It does so when it knows the move Rollout and levels up, but only in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. This fact makes it one of only four Pokémon (the others being Mamoswine, Tangrowth, and Yanmega) that evolve from a previously obtainable Pokémon in a way that would have been possible in previous games: by learning a certain move. Not much else can be discerned from Lickilicky`s pre-evolved form, except it can learn Explosion, meaning that it is the only Pokémon (besides Smeargle through its unique Sketch move) that can learn Explosion and receive a Same Type Attack Bonus from it as well. It has a bizarre, rather swirly protusion on its head resembling hair. Lickilicky also has thumb spikes, and a white bib-like pattern on its chest in front of the neck. This design may be based on old 60-70`s diner mascots.",
