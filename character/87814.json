  "description" : "Sonia is a member of http://anidb.net/ch660 [Griffith]`s Band of the Hawk, serving as their medium. Upon seeing him for the first time, Sonia becomes enraptured by Griffith`s charisma, and is extremely devout in her admiration of him thereafter.\nSonia is a happy-go-lucky girl who is often naive when it comes to Griffith. She did not speak much before meeting him, but makes her mind known often now that she can. She is considered eerie by the other soldiers, and for good reason; in addition to being an empath, she is entirely at ease with the apostles that make up Griffith`s army, who are rightly known to be frightening.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
