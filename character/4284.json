  "description" : "Miharu stumbles into earth`s Mizuno City, from an alternate universe, Seiren City. Not having much experience in life, Miharu is very naive and believes what anyone tells her, but also exhibits a supernatural ability to be air headed. She seems to be unaware of those around her and does everything at her own pace. She has decided her life`s mission is to cure Yukinari of his women allergies because she is the only girl that he can touch without breaking out into hives. So far, he`s shown no sign of improvement. Her appetite and ability to eat surpasses that of an average human. She can eat endless amounts but still maintain her girlish figure. When she becomes nervous, she has the ability to blow up things in her immediate vicinity.",
