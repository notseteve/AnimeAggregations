  "description" : "Vasili Laptev is the boss of a branch of the Russian mafia based in Tokyo. A former KGB officer, Laptev had many difficulties operating in Japan due to his status as a foreigner. Considered distasteful and incompetent by Balalaika, he appeared to lose his standing with his peers back in Russia and this was reflected in his arrogant personality, since he did not speak Japanese despite being based in Japan. Laptev`s detachment is slaughtered single-handedly by Ginji when the fallout between Hotel Moscow and the Washimine-gumi begins.",
