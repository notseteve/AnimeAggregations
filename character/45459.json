  "description" : "Fullmoon`s 28-year-old manager, and a former avid fangirl of ROUTE:L, especially Wakaouji. She started out as an unsuccessful idol singer, under the stage name Yuina Hanakazari (花飾 結菜), before moving into management. In the manga, she has an affair with her boss out of loneliness despite his being married. She truly loves Wakaouji, having been smitten with him since his days in Route:L, but she feels she is too old and unworthy of true love with a man. To cope with this despair, as well as with the pressures of her job, she often loses herself in a bottle of sake. (In reality, Arina Tanemura says Masami is a heavy drinker because Tanemura`s editors like to drink, and Ooshige`s name is a hybrid of the editors` names.) At the end of the manga, Wakaouji discovers Masami is the one who composed the mysterious love letter, making her the one he really loved all that time, and so asks her to marry him.",
