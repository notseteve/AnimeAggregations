  "description" : "Being the Boxing Pokémon and a Fighting type, Hala`s Crabrawler always wants to be at the top. While guarding its weak points with its pincers during fights, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. It did not undergo ordinary, run-of-the-mill training as Hala works with all his Pokémon to unlock their potential.\nDuring the Grand Trial battle against Ash`s Rowlet, Crabrawler was at a disadvantage due to the types. Rowlet was able to use the smokescreen from Leafage to surprise Crabrawler and Peck it from behind to have a successful counterattack to all the previous attacks. That was the turning point in the match as Ash`s Rowlet won the match but fell asleep while flying as it got too tired from battling.",
