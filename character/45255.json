  "description" : "Another mobile suit developed in anticipation of their assault on Earth during the First Neo Zeon War, Neo Zeon`s AMX-102 Zssa is designed as a long-range bombardment unit for attacking targets from behind the front lines. Intended to work in concert with the AMX-101 Galluss-J, the Zssa is armed with 44 missiles as its primary armament. In addition to beam sabers, a scattering beam gun, and a pair of vulcan guns for closer-range and melee combat, the Zssa can also be fitted with an optional pair of shoulder missile pods containing 7 additional missiles each. An optional booster can also be mounted on the Zssa`s back, giving the mobile suit an additional 8 missiles and the ability to fly in the atmosphere, allowing the Zssa to conduct aerial bombardments. The Zssa proves itself quite effective as a long-range strike unit, and it`s one of the most commonly mass produced Neo Zeon mobile suits used in the war. Some units survive the First Neo Zeon War and are later used by the \"Sleeves\" faction of Neo Zeon in U.C. 0096.\nSource: mahq.net",
