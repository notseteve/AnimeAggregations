  "description" : "Iks is a mystery. He was alone when Honoka found him, quietly watching the fireflies at night. The moment their eyes met, Honoka was struck by his presence... and she hasn`t quite been able to figure out why. Iks is compassionate, kind, and very calm. He also possesses a strange power that allows him to heal wounds. The Third seem to be particularly interested in Iks, for reasons that they aren`t willing to share.",
