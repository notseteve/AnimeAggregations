She and Show Zama first meet as enemies, but, between her getting him to question his allegiance, and his guilt when House Luft attacks House Given and kills Nie`s mother, he soon allies with her. Her fighting abilities are on par with Show, but she lags far behind him in Aura Power. When the battling armies of Byston Well are sent to Upper Earth by the Ferario, Marvel takes time to reconcile with her parents, and also to spend a few days visiting Hawaii with Show. Though, early on, she seems to have some interest in Nie, Marvel falls deeply in love with Show, and wishes that he would admit the feelings she knows he has for her.\nSource: Wiki",
