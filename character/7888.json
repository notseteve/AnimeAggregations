  "description" : "Chaos Dragon Garv was created during the Shinma War, and is over 5000 years old. Though the Shinma War has ended, the overall conflict between shinzoku and mazoku has not. Shabranigdu at some point created five subordinates of his own: Hellmaster Fibrizo, Chaos Dragon Garv, Greater Beast Zelas Metallium, Dynast Grausherra, and Deep Sea Dolphin.\nGarv`s human form is a roughly middle aged man with long red hair wearing a trench coat and carrying a huge sword; his beast form is an enormous three headed red dragon. Although the exact details are unknown, this similarity to shinzoku in form is no coincidence: In the Kouma War, Ruby Eye Shabranigdu specificly required his assistance to defeat Aqualord Ragradia, although the Maou had a stronger minion, Hellmaster Fibrizo at his disposal.\nThe victory over the Aqualord came with a price for Garv, however, as Ragradia used the last amounts of his power to seal Garv into his human form. He hoped that similarly to Shabranigdu, Garv`s power would slowly diminish as he is reborn over and over again. But for inexplicable reasons, the result was the complete opposite: Garv became stronger with each rebirth.",
