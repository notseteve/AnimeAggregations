  "description" : "Rein is the other Twin princess of Ohisama no Kuni. Unlike Fine, she has sea green eyes and blue hair. Although she is also referred to as one of \"the most unprincess-like princesses in the history of Fushigi-boshi\", she is not entirely like Fine. She likes to dress up and wear very elaborate decorations. However, she can get very crazy when it comes to daydreaming about romance, mostly about her crush, Prince Bright. She is still very friendly and eccentric as her sister, but is adventurous, unlike the cowering Fine. She is also caring and think positive ways to fix things. Rein`s name was originally going to be spelled as \"Rain\" in English, but was changed when director Junichi Sato did not want her name to be related to the weather rain. Prince Shade has a crush on her in the manga, while Prince Bright (who had a previous crush on Fine), had a crush on Rein in the anime. Rein can sometimes act more ladylike than Fine.",
