  "description" : "A gentle cook. She enjoys cooking and is in the cooking club. She also cooks at Chao Bao Zi, a restaurant operated out of a streetcar that sells meat buns and other foods with Chao, Hakase, Ku, and Chachamaru. She is also the school dining officer. A very nice and hard-working person, Satsuki is liked by everyone in Mahora, even Evangeline (who sees the rest of the class as a pack of air-headed beasts) and Nitta (who views the middle school students, especially the ones from 3-A, as rowdy kids who need to be disciplined at all times). Her very presence creates an atmosphere of serenity, and she can quickly put a stop to fights even between the hot-headed students in the High School and University martial arts clubs. Satsuki`s dream is to have her own restaurant, as she likes making people happy through her food.",
