  "description" : "Loz (ロッズ) is the third member in the group of three Remnants of Sephiroth in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. He is described as being the embodiment of Sephiroth`s physical strength, as well as his fondness and emotional instability concerning \"Mother\" that Sephiroth shows during the Nibelheim incident. While physically the strongest of the three, Loz has a real soft spot, especially on the topic of Jenova, as he apparently cries a lot, a fact that Yazoo points out, often in mockery.\nHe is physically very bulky and muscular, akin to the likes of Barret Wallace. His silver hair is short and slightly spiky with sideburns, and he has green eyes. He wears his weapon, the Dual Hound, on his left arm and uses a Velvet Nightmare handgun otherwise. His torso is also covered over with crossing black straps and shoulder guards.",
