  "description" : "Seno Miyagi is a high-ranking member of the science division on Second Earth. He suggests that Marlene and Yuuji are kept together in order to get the best results from Yuuji in the sleeper program. Not agreeing with the High Council`s leadership of Second Earth or its reckless use of the sleepers, he eventually forms a group called The Ark, which would later overthrow the High Council`s \"government\" on Second Earth. Seno would subsequently become the leader of Second Earth, but only for a brief time. His order to abandon Earth eventually results in a revolt and his execution by citizens whom wanted to return to Earth.",
