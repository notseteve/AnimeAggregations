  "description" : "Tenkou is a water user like Genbu. She appears to be about the same age as Kazane and has long, light sliver hair. Tenkou is the weakest out of the eight fighting and is angry with her for that. She gets along well with Kouchin. She is about as stubborn as Seiryuu but has her gentle side.\nSource: Wiki",
