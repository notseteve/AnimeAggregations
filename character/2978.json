  "description" : "Yomi lost her parents at a young age to specters, and was taken in by Isayama Naraku, then head of the Isayama family. Yomi grew to love and respect her foster-father, and polished her skills to repay him for his kindness. Her efforts led to her inheritance of the priced Isayama heirloom, the sword Shishio, which held the spiritual beast Nue in it. Before Naraku`s death, she was betrothed to Izuna Noriyuki and would have succeeded Naraku as the next Isayama head. However, Naraku`s death at the hands of her cousin Mei, who was jealous of her good fortune, and the alteration of Naraku`s will, resulted in her being stripped of her position in the family and therefore her entire inheritance. Yomi eventually found out the truth behind her father`s death, revealed by Mei herself after the latter lured her out in order to kill her. Partly in self-defense, she killed Mei and avenged Naraku, but was ambushed by Mitagawa Kazuhiro, who wounded her so badly that she became hospitalised, her throat and most of the tendons in her body cut and unrepairable, unable to talk or move. This, in addition to the suspicion that she had murdered Mei, led to a series of events that caused her to succumb to Mitagawa`s temptation to accept the sesshouseki. Though Yomi managed to retain some control over her mind, she had nonetheless fallen under the destructive influence of the stone, causing her to kill many many members of the Agency. Ultimately, it was her love and desire to protect Kagura that caused her death at Kagura`s hands, in a desperate wish that she could remove anything that would harm Kagura, including herself.",
