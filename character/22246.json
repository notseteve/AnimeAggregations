  "description" : "The ZAKU Warrior, whose name stands for ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity, is part of a new series of mass production mobile suits developed by ZAFT after the end of the previous war. The ZAKU was originally intended to use a nuclear engine, but after the conclusion of the Junius Treaty it was redesigned with a conventional battery system instead. Its overall performance is nonetheless very high, and it can adapt to a variety of combat situations using specialized Wizard backpacks. In the hands of an expert pilot, the ZAKU is a match even for the newest Gundam mobile suits.",
