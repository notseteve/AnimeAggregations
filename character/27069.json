  "description" : "The Ryouzanpaku Dojo is home to elite fighters who specialize in different styles of martial arts. The dojo is famous for its powerful members and is challenged by other dojos and fighters so often that it charges its challengers and has a waiting list. Despite this, the dojo lacks money, during the YOMI arc it goes bankrupt.\nAlthough they are all immeasurably powerful, the masters of Ryouzanpaku are also very eccentric and prone to immature behavior. They have trouble interacting with normal people, mainly because they unconsciously release massive amounts of ki, which sometimes makes the people they encounter feel nauseated. They are lazy procrastinators - only Ma and Kouetsuji are shown to bring in any steady income, while Apachai and Shigure have childish tendencies.",
