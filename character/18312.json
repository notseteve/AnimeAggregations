  "description" : "Mukurou is a wanted criminal, pirate captain, former cohort of http://anidb.net/ch4865 [Mugen]. He carries a revolver tucked in his waistband. His clothing includes a sawtooth design, wristbands and ankle bandages, which http://anidb.net/ch18313 [Koza] and a younger Mugen both share in appearance.\nLike his sister, Koza, he has a fairly swarthy complexion. He double-crossed Mugen at least once before and does it again. After their `reunion`, he convinces Mugen to rob a government ship with him, the spoils being 60,000 gold ryo. After Mugen and the pirates ram the government ship and kill most of the guards, Mukuro blows up the pirate ship with Mugen on board. He returns to shore on the (now empty) government ship, where he and his secret accomplice, a government official named http://anidb.net/ch18314 [Shiren], hoard the gold. Unfortunately, Koza is none too fond of her brother (according to her, he killed her mother), and engineers the double-cross into a triple-cross. He and http://anidb.net/ch4864 [Jin] end up dueling. He fans two shots at Jin; however, Jin anticipates and evades them. Mukuro met his end when Jin sliced him across the chest, then stabbed him from behind seconds after drawing his katana.\nSource: Wikipedia",
