  "description" : "Takemi has dark blue hair in a messy bob-cut with blunt bangs and brown eyes. She has red nail polish on her fingernails and toenails.\nHer outfit consists of a typical white lab-coat that is worn over a short black dress. She accessorizes with a red grommet belt, a black studded necklace choker which connects to multiple necklaces, and strappy black platform high heels.\nIn her casual outfit, she still wears her choker and necklace. She now has a bracelet, short black jacket, a blue dress with a white spiderweb design, and black ripped leggings.\nTae Takemi is the owner of Takemi Medical Clinic in Yongen-Jaya. She believes in her own theory of pharmaceutics and sells barely legal prescriptions to her patients secretly. She originally worked for a university but was fired after she was scapegoated for a disastrous medical trial she advised against, and it is eventually revealed her clinical trial is actually an attempt to perfect the drug and regain her credibility. Later, it is revealed the patient who died actually survived, but lost her confidence in Takemi`s old hospital and transferred out-to prevent bad PR, the director Ooyamada Shouichi (who was jealous of Takemi to begin with, feeling he only received his position due to nepotism) covered up her survival and perjured Takemi for the patient`s \"death;\" after stealing his heart, he admits the truth and Takemi`s good name is restored.\nAfter the completion of Futaba`s Palace, the protagonist calls Takemi. After a brief examination, Takemi states that Futaba Sakura has unnaturally low stamina and strength, most likely due to her shut-in nature.\nSource: Wikia",
