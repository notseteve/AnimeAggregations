  "description" : "Set in a fictional version of Japan, during the pre-Meiji period, Kenshin is a former legendary assassin known as \"Hitokiri Battousai\". At the end of the Bakumatsu, he becomes a wandering samurai, now wielding a sakabatou (\"reverse-blade sword\"), a katana that has the cutting edge on the inwardly curved side of the sword, thus being nearly incapable of killing. Kenshin wanders the countryside of Japan offering protection and aid to those in need, as atonement for the murders he once committed as an assassin. In Tokyo, he meets a young woman named Kamiya Kaoru, who invites him to live in her dojo despite learning about Kenshin`s past. Throughout the series, Kenshin begins to establish lifelong relationships with many people, including ex-enemies, while dealing with his fair share of enemies, new and old. Through these encounters and relationships, Kenshin begins to find true atonement for his past enabling him to fully conquer his \"Battousai\" nature.",
