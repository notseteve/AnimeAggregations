  "description" : "Kuriyama Mirai is an underworlder who has the ability to manipulate blood. However, this ability is considered heresy by even the other underworlders, so she is shunned. Due to a certain incident in the past, she is not good at dealing with Youmu, and thus her source of income was cut off. Thanks to this, she lives in great poverty. Her hobbies are tending bonsai plants and looking at unhappy blogs. Mirai is a first-year student in high school.\nSource: ANN",
