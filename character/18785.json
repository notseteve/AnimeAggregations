  "description" : "Known as the \"Black Sekirei\" and \"MBI`s dog\", Karasuba is the leader of the third Disciplinary Squad, with her weapon of choice being a nodachi.\nIn the past, Karasuba was a member of the first Disciplinary Squad and teamed up with Yume in the second Disciplinary Squad.\nIt is later revealed that Karasuba wanted to fight and defeat Yume and, as a result, resents Yume for \"disappearing\" before they could settle their rivalry.\nThis unsettled matter appears to have heavily influenced Karasuba`s actions throughout the story. She maintains a \"friendly\" relationship with Musubi (whom she calls \"Muu-chan\"), and the two have made a promise to be the last two Sekirei standing.\nAfter the escape plan and the failure of Haihane and Benitsubasa, she tried to kill both of them.\nKarasuba and Miya do not associate well with each other (Miya not allowing her to set foot in Izumo Inn) and tend to come close to fighting each other at the mere appearance of the other.\nHer name (karasu+ba) means \"raven wings\" literally.",
