  "description" : "Giose Croce is an agent in Section 2, http://anidb.net/ch7620 [Henrietta]`s handler and http://anidb.net/ch14837 [Jean]`s younger brother. A former officer with the Carabinieri and son of a powerful Public Prosecutor (father, Giovanni) and Defense Attorney (mother, Carla), both of whom were killed in a terrorist car bombing with his younger sister, Enrica, whom Henrietta has a strong resemblance to. Giose is strongly against treating the children the agency \"fixed up\" as mere tools of vengeance and is quite aware of their propensity for feeling emotion and pain, as well as each having a separate consciousness.\nThe name \"Giuseppe\" is used only in ADV`s English adaptation of the manga; in the Japanese-language manga and anime, this character is named Giose (ジョゼ), which has been rendered as Giose and even Giuse for the North American DVD release from FUNimation. Both forms have the same meaning: they are translations of the name \"Joseph\". Although in flashback of Enrica Croce, Carla mentioned Giose as Gioseffo (ジョゼッフォ) when she told her daughter to invite his brother to her football match replacing her.\nSource: wiki",
