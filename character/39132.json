The name means \"family\" or \"relative\" from the Tagalog word, mag-anak (inspired by the Filipino and Arab workers in the middle east, specially, Saudi Arabia, most of them are engineers). Led by Rashid Kurama, they are often seen at Quatre`s side, who they refer to as \"Master Quatre\". In Episode Zero, Quatre saved them and they`ve been at his service ever since. Almost all the Maganac have the same mobile suit, but each of the squad leaders have their own personalized touches, the most notable being Rashid`s wing-shaped antenna atop his suit`s head.",
