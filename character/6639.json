  "description" : "Anizawa Meito, also known as Anime Tenchou, is the manager of the Animate Ikebukuro shop (However, he appeared in the (old) Oomiya shop and the comic market booth in the Anime and appeared in the Akihabara shop in the PS2 Video Game), he was originally the mascot of Animate and Hero of Anime Tenchou.\nHe and his staff consider Konata their most valued customer, known as \"Legendary Girl A\" (伝説の少女A ,Densetsu no Shoujo A), and go to great lengths to sell their merchandise to her, often to the point of using espionage and military-style strategies, and at one point, Meito himself uses \"Geass\" on Konata to persuade her to buy a DVD from him; however when she tries to pay it, she fell short only three yen. Their attempts usually fail miserably. His appearance is heavily stylized, compared to the other characters, and he is known for his passionate yelling and highly energetic movements and poses. He appeared as a special guest during the Lucky Channel segment in episode seventeen, during which he and Minoru parody Mobile Fighter G Gundam`s Domon Kasshu, referencing the fact that Meito`s voice actor also played the character. He also appeared in episode twelve, fighting against another sales manager (about how valuable \"so-called leftovers\" can be after they ran out of rare and limited edition \"thingies\") in a dramatic way. Meito`s colleagues at Animate are all similarly enthusiastic about selling their merchandise. In 2002, Gainax produced a single original video animation, where Meito Anisawa and his fellow employees are the focus.",
