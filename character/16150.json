  "description" : "Fujima Kenji is the player and coach of Shoyo High. As such, he only enters the court when his presence is really needed, such as when the team is behind and struggling. Fujima is so respected by his teammates that as much as possible they try not to make it necessary for him to get on the court, and even the hint of his getting off the bench to join them inspires them to play harder.\nSource: wikipedia",
