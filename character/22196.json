  "description" : "This land battleship, named after the 19th-century diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps, serves as the flagship of Andrew Waltfeld`s forces. The Lesseps is designed to travel half-submerged in the sand, using the arrays of microscopic scale motors on its lower hull to liquefy the ground and propel the ship forward. In addition to its powerful cannons and missile launchers, the Lesseps is equipped with underground torpedoes which use their own scale motors to burrow through the ground. Its primary function, however, is as a mobile suit carrier, and vessels of this type are classified as land carriers by the Earth Alliance forces.",
