  "description" : "Shouko Kirishima is the childhood friend of Yuji Sakamoto. She is the top student in her level and the class representative for class A. In the story, she is portrayed as a soft-spoken, but highly assertive and intelligent girl. In the novel, her dialog always starts with ellipses. She is described as elegantly beautiful and very popular, but yet has no boyfriend, which initially created the impression to others that she is a lesbian. Later, it was revealed that the reason for this is because she is crazily infatuated with Yuji since childhood and acts possessively towards him. Despite being tricked multiple times, she still shows a trusting nature towards Yuji and practically believes everything he says. Shouko is also shown to be someone who is very long-term thinking, and has already decided on her children`s names (Shoyuu for a girl, and Koshou for a boy). She is also a gadget moron, and is known to spoil any electronic gadget that falls into her hands. Her Shoukanjuu is clad in Samurai armor and wields a Japanese longsword.",
