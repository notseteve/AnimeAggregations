  "description" : "A man from the local Shinto shrine who is in love with Shaorin. In the manga he also runs the school store, which provides more opportunity to see Shaorin and participate in stories. He is aware of Shaorin`s nature. He has the cool, cheerful look whenever he is near cute girls, but has an evil look towards the boys, making the guys suggest he has a split-personality. He is also not above using underhanded tactics to try to get Shaorin, where once he realized she was in love with Tasuke, he tried to manipulate her lack of understanding towards these feelings into the belief that it was guilt, overall suggesting that she should leave him as she sees herself as a burden to Tasuke.",
