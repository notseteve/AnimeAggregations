  "description" : "Komugi (コムギ) is a blind girl from the Republic of East Gorteau and reigning world champion of Gungi (軍儀), a board game created in the country. When Meruem took over East Gorteau he challenged numerous expert game players and beat them at their specialties, however, Komugi is the only one he is unable to beat. Komugi ends up influencing Meruem into becoming more human-like while her exposure to him awakens her ability to use Nen, improving her Gungi skills.\nSource: Wikipedia",
