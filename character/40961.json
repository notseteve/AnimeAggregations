  "description" : "Roche is a respectable journalist who loves money and women.\nHe has never taken photos without receiving a payment for them, but in episode 9, he sent the photos he took of Angelique - which he had originally intended to sell to Bernard for money - to Angelique herself. This was done out of kindness when he realized that Angelique, like himself, was an orphan and he didn`t feel that he should sell her information to others. He, however, did not regret making that decision and was a bit confused and surprised at himself as that was the first time he had taken photos of other people without charging for them.\nThe \"secret date\" he went on with Angelique was not a real date. He happened to see Angelique on the streets after Angelique ran from Sally and Hannah, since she was upset about her best friends refusing to accept the truth (the fact that the Jinx machines were destroying many people`s homes and even taking away some lives in the process of destroying Thanatos). He called it a \"secret date\" but in truth, he wanted to cheer up Angelique when he saw just how upset she was.\nHe eventually develops romantic feelings towards Angelique.\nHe is shown throwing knives in his fight with Erebos/Nyx.\nSource: Wiki",
