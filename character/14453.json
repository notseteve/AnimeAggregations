  "description" : "Like the original Miss Bellum, her face doesn`t appear on screen; however, unlike the original, she is now blonde. Usually, Miss Bellum covers her face with a tablet computer, which has lips imprinted on it. While the Mayor is different from his original counterpart, Miss Bellum still does most of his work for him, and still appears to be the brains of the operation. She also instructs the girls a bit, which she has done several times in the original. Fuzzy Lumpkins has a crush on her; however, she dislikes Fuzzy. In Episode 51, a pre-historic version of Miss Bellum is shown as the inventor of fire after being hit by a way-ward Chemical Z Light particle that scattered across Earth`s timeline. At one point in pre-production, Miss Bellum had facial features. She is represented by lip prints like the one on her tablet computer.",
