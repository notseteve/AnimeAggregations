  "description" : "Cloyster are bivalve Pok√©mon, guarded by an extremely strong, multi-layered shell. This shells cannot be opened even by those with superior strength, and they cannot be damaged even by a bomb. Nobody has seen their dark innards, which are Cloyster`s weak spot as they are very soft and vulnerable. They launch thick, powerful spikes at enemies in battle, as well as to capture prey. These spikes are even stronger than their shell. Cloyster can also crush prey by clamping their thick shell shut onto them. When being attacked, they simply shut their shells to avoid further damage. To travel through water, they swim by swallowing water and jetting it out opposite to the direction they want to move.",
