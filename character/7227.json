  "description" : "Pachira is a vampire and while she displays the common weakness of vampires such as a weakness to garlic, her biggest weakness, at least in her mind, is her small breast size. She has the ability to fly and is seen eating regular food as well as having a vampire`s lust for drinking blood - although she mainly drinks tomato juice. She turns to ash in sunlight, but it is not fatal. She wears a long coat and cardboard box over her head whenever she goes out and when she goes to the beach she wears a heavy coat of sunscreen, she does not turn to ash.",
