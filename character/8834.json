When Günter accidentally travels to Earth, he becomes a model in New York City for a brief period of time so that he can earn money to find Yuuri. He is a very whimsical person and poetic in his thoughts. Günter is another test subject of Anissina.\nGünter, along with the three brothers, helps Yuuri run the country. He is Yuuri`s adviser and mentor, teaching Yuuri various aspects of Shin Makoku. He usually spends his time doing numerous duties for Yuuri and Shin Makoku.",
