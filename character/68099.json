  "description" : "Korrina`s Riolu had been together with Korrina since she was small. They played together every day, laughed, ate and sometimes they fought. They grew up like siblings.\nKorrina`s Riolu evolved into Korrina`s Lucario one day. Lucario and Korrina are soulmates. One day they met Ash Ketchum and Pikachu near Route 5 and they were their 99th straight battle. Korrina`s Lucario defeated Pikachu for their 99th victory and Korrina noted that Pikachu was a strong opponent.\nRocket Gang noted that having a Lucario that could Mega Evolve and could defeat Pikachu was a Pok√©mon worth capturing. For a short time they managed to capture Korrina`s Lucario but Rocket Gang ended up being the 100th straight victory as they were sent off flying.",
