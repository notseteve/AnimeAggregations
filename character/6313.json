  "description" : "Kiriya is introduced in episode 13. His last appearance in Season 1 was episode 49. He otherwise appears in episodes 13-21 and 44-49. In his aformentioned last appearance he is a normal human with brown hair and brown eyes and has a normal human life and family. He is also the youngest of the Dark Five. He comes to the Garden of Rainbows (Earth) in order to spy on Honoka and Nagisa. He infiltrates their school as a freshman and ends up becoming friends with them and developing a fondness for Honoka after she shows kindness to him. Later on he starts to have emotions and feelings for Honoka. He joins the soccer team and becomes quite popular with the girls, which confuses him slightly as he does not understand human emotions. When it comes time for him to fight Pretty Cure in episode 21, he finds himself unable to do so and ends up going back to the Dusk Zone where he will be made to disappear for his betrayal, but not before handing his Prism Stone over to them of his own will. He is Poisonee`s younger brother and has similar dark-rimmed eyes as she does. He is pale with light blue eyes (green in his human form) and dark green hair. When masquerading as a human, he has eyebrows, which, in his true form, he does not. Like his sister, he has fangs when in his true form.",
