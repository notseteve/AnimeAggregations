  "description" : "He is one of the six members of Aion`s team. He wanted to avenge Rizelle after learning that she had been killed. He`s the third to be killed by Duke Duffau. In the manga, he displayed fondness to Rizelle and was greatly angered at her death to the point that he challenged Aion with his decision.\nGenai`s left arm and eyes were slashed by Pandemonium`s claws and as such the legion that reside there have died off. Aion had Shader construct metal appendages to replace the killed off limbs. Genai wears a mask that covers his eyes which hide eyes sewn shut. He slowly dies after the battle on Eden against the pursuers and the Order. As he dies, he reaches his arm towards the sky saying how beautiful the sky is and whether Rizelle could see them too.\nSource: Wiki",
