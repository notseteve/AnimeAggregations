  "description" : "Kuroko (or Kurokochi as Kise calls him) is a short stiff guy who plays basketball worse than any amateur. But, he has one and only talent that makes him invincible: he has a great ability in misdirection and passing the ball, also due to his extremely small size and build (comparing to other players), he often gets ignored and therefore he can \"hide\" himself behind other regulars and distract them by ball movement so no one will notice he is there. the benefits of his invisible style, (as taiga calls it) makes him able to steal balls from players without them noticing he is around. He is known as the Invisible Phantom sixth of the famous group of middle schoolers, \"Kiseki no Sedai\".\nHis Weak point is that he looses his effectiveness after 40 minutes and other players will get used to his presence.",
