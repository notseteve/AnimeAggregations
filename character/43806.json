  "description" : "When Leo Aiolia went to Japan to deal with the rebelling Bronze Saints, he was sent under the watch of three Silver Saints. Dio was one of them, and spent most of the time sneering at the other Saints. When Aiolia decided to spare Pegasus Seiya`s life for the moment, Dio and the others remarked that the Gold Saint was too soft, and decided to deal with Seiya themselves. After throwing Seiya around with their respective attacks, the young Bronze Saint received unexpected help from the Sagittarius Gold Cloth, enwrapping his body to protect him. The three Silver Saints did not heed Aiolia`s warning to stay away, and charged straight towards Seiya, only to be killed by the Sagittarius Gold Cloth in mere seconds.\nSource: Wikipedia",
