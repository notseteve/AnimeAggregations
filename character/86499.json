  "description" : "Alba`s Cubone was the final Pokémon that Alba used in his rematch battle against the Clembot. It quickly finished off Clemont`s Magneton before facing Clemont`s Heliolisk.\nIts Bonemerang proved to be a very powerful move as it knocked out Elezard when they pulled on the training advice of the Clembot which taught them; that Pokémon have endless potential and that drawing out their strengths is a Trainer`s duty. Alba and his Pokémon believed in those words and worked hard and it paid off as they defeated the Clembot to get the Voltage Badge.",
