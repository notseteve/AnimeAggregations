  "description" : "Younger daughter of the Tsuwabuki family. Her clone, Ayumi, is used as the sacrifice in Taisai, the ritual of taming the behemoth within Mt. Fuji every 30 years preventing the volcano from erupting. The ritual involves claiming the life of a Chijutsushi, who is usually a member of the Tsuwabuki family, since 300 years ago. Due to Kareha`s influence, she is a cold, heartless woman, from her portrayal and behavior towards her clone. She later feels remorse after Ayumi`s sacrifice.",
