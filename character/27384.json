  "description" : "Whimsicott, known as the Windveiled Pokémon, evolves from Cottonee when exposed to a Sun Stone. It resembles a plant-like creature with a large puff of cotton on its head. It not only drifts with the wind, but can also slip through cracks like the breeze can. It can therefore enter homes and pull pranks on the inhabitants.\nWhimsicott can be found rarely in the wild in Black version. Whimsicott made its debut anime appearance in Pokémon the Movie: Black - Victini and Reshiram and White - Victini and Zekrom. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Whimsicott is seen being released by its Trainer after Ghetsis`s speech in Accumula Town and holding the leg of its Trainer, wanting to stay.",
