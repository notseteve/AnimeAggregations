  "description" : "Pain (Human Path) was the fourth of Nagato`s Six Paths of Pain to be shown. It was destroyed during the Invasion of Pain after it was struck by Naruto Uzumaki`s Wind Release: Rasenshuriken.\nWhen it was alive, the Human Path belonged to a tall, slender man from Takigakure. In the anime, he was shown to have been a level-headed ninja who believed that all he could do to try and achieve peace and to teach the next generation to survive the battles with other ninja until it came. The Human Path, like all of the six paths, possessed Nagato`s Rinnegan. It had long, loose orange hair, which was a light gray-blue colour while it was alive. It had multiple piercings, including a diagonal bar though its nose, two circular studs in a vertical row on each of its cheeks, two studs placed horizontally on its chin, and a stud on each of its shoulders near its neck. The diagonal nose piercing makes it the only Pain with asymmetrical facial piercings.\nDuring Pain`s battle with Jiraiya, the Human Path`s eyes were damaged and it was left unable to see. For this reason, it used only taijutsu during the battle. The Human Path was later shown to have the capability of mind reading simply by placing its hand over the target`s head, and could extort any information or secret being hidden by the victim against his/her will. The most powerful and lethal ability possessed by the Human Path was its power to remove its target`s soul by ripping it out of his/her body, thus killing the victim.\nDespite its lethal ability, Nagato deemed the Human Path less important than Animal Path, as he sacrificed it to get the Animal Path out of Naruto`s Wind Release: Rasenshuriken`s radius, having the path ripped to bits.",
