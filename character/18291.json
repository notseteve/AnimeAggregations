  "description" : "Madoushi is the older brother of Makenshi, looking similar except for his red clothes and hair. Originally his younger brother`s only friend, Madoushi taught Makenshi everything he knew in the art of combat. Much to Madoushi`s dismay, however, Makenshi outdid him in swordsmanship. As a result, Madoushi felt himself to be in his younger brother`s shadow and wanted to see who was stronger, even after he died when Chaos attacked their world to prove himself stronger.\nHe initially appears as part of Oscha`s plot to stall the protagonists on the Ocean Puzzle, however it was to feed Chaos with Makenshi`s horror of facing his own brother as Madoushi had intended to see once and for all who was the greater brother. But Makenshi was reluctantly forced to take his brother down for good. Makenshi still thinks about Madoushi, wondering if his brother intended the fight to go that way.\nAfter Chaos is defeated, Crux discovered Madoushi`s grave in the ruins of Misteria. There she discovers a crystal that contained Madoushi`s power, and by instinct sought to give it to Makenshi. With the crystal, Makenshi receives his brother`s power.",
