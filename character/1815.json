  "description" : "A fortress-type Gunmen, the flying Dai-Gunten is Cytomander`s flagship. The Dai-Gunten made its d√©but during Cytomander`s campaign against the Dai-Gurren, acting primarily as a carrier to launch multiple waves of small aerial Gunmen bombers.\nAs the battle wore on, Simon and Yoko`s Gurren-Lagann and Viral`s Enkidu found their way deep below its decks and ended up dealing severe internal damage to the ship. Having lost altitude in the process, the Dai-Gunten was eventually damaged by a series of powerful kicks delivered by the Dai-Gurren, which had launched itself into the air using a cliff face. In the process, Team Dai-Gurren managed to snatch one of the enemy airship`s two Levia-Spheres for themselves, and used it to safely float back to the ground, while the Dai-Gunten managed to retreat using the remaining one.\nA month after the first confrontation, the Dai-Gunten returns in the following episode along Guame`s flagship, the Dai-Gundo, as Teppelin`s last line of defence against Team Dai-Gurren`s invasion. Its forces managed to trap the Gurren-Lagann, after the rest of the Dai-Gurren`s gunman forces were forced to retreat and protect it against Guame`s offensive, and when the Shuzack was about to finish it, Simon and Rossiu were saved by some unexpected allies who entered the battlefield to aid them. In the end, the Dai-Gunten is sunk once run through by the flying Dai-Gurren. Pieces of its wreckage fell on the Dai-Gundo, provoking a massive explosion, but was unable to damage the heavily armoured flagship.",
