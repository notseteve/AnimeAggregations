  "description" : "Kyhilam Jiste is a great demon from the Dorfmond clan who competed against http://anidb.net/ch107910 [Anos Voldigoad] during the Mythical Age. Known as the King of Curses, Kyhilam is one of the Four Evil Royals.\nKyhilam has a split personality. His main one is that of the Curse King Kyhilam, while the other is that of his lover, Jiste. When the personalities switch, both their memory and source change completely; searching Jiste`s memories would not give any of Kyhilam`s, though there`s still only one source. Kyhilam himself cannot switch personalities at will.\nSource: Maou Gakuin Wiki",
