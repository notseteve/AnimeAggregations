  "description" : "Sandra is the second of Raindevila`s primary henchmen to appear in the story, but only in the anime. He sends out the three devils Blitz, Noise, and Cloud to find the Saint Something Four. As the episodes progress, one by one they are purified, including Sandra`s side devil Donna. In episode 22, Sandra locates and kidnaps Jama-P to lure out the Love Angels, which ultimately backfires and gets him purified by the love wave.",
