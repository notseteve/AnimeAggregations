  "description" : "To help his family, Hyuuga Kojirou wants to be a professional player, an ace striker. His devotion to football and his persistence to shoot the goal is outstanding. He was both Tsubasa`s and Genzou`s top rival. A great guy, Hyuuga is not only strong, he is also tough but at the same time caring. Can be a bit impulsive at times, though. He was once famous because of his roughness and many players were scared of him. But, Hyuuga is actually a kind boy who cares about his family and friends. In the World Youth series, Hyuuga was one of the 7 players to be excluded from the Japanese National team after they lost 3 group matches with Real Japan 7 (R.J.7). Determined to get back into the team, Hyuuga developed a new shot, the Raijuu shot, a shot which is a bit similar to Tsubasa`s Drive Shoot, except that Hyuuga`s Raijuu Shot is a ground shot that will curve upward, unlike Tsubasa`s Drive Shooter which will go up then curve downward.",
