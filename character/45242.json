  "description" : "One of many new prototype mobile suits developed by Neo Zeon during the First Neo Zeon War, the AMX-104 R-Jarja`s form is inspired by the old Principality of Zeon`s YMS-15 Gyan from the One Year War. Like the Gyan, the R-Jarja is designed primarily for melee combat, and is armed with a large hand-carried beam sword and a removable heat saber mounted like a bayonet on its beam rifle. Two sets of missile launchers in the shoulders round out its armament, but the R-Jarja features a rather unique defensive feature. This feature is the pair of \"flexible shields\" mounted on its shoulders, which can be flipped to provide additional armor protection to either the front or rear of the R-Jarja. Initially a single prototype that is intended for later mass production, the R-Jarja never makes it past the experimental stage, with one completed unit operated by ace pilot Chara Soon.\nSource: mahq.net",
