  "description" : "Kirino is Haruhiko`s childhood friend and next door neighbour. They are such good friends that she often comes over to his house in the mornings before school to not only wake him up, but also to make him breakfast. She tends to be the unfortunate receiver of much of Haruhiko`s teasing due to her timid nature, though she does not mind it much, as she is in love with Haruhiko.",
