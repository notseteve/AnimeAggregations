  "description" : "Mitsurugi Ryouko is a martial arts expert and Daimon High`s current K-Fight champion. She seeks to learn the way of the sword, but is slightly self-conscious due to her height (she`s 5`9\" in the manga) and her samurai obsession. She is highly skilled in Kendo; onlyShishikura Tatsuya, the captain of the kendo team, is able to beat her in formal kendo. Her rival is Kiribayashi Azumi, as she is a highly skilled fighter and is also in love with Shishikura Tatsuya. She also helps out the drama club with the school plays. In the manga her goals are different; she seeks to become a great woman by using the way of the sword and acts as a vigilante in the name of justice. Later on she becomes the leader of an all female fighting group.",
