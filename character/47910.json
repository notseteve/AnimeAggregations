  "description" : "Phil Barnett is a knight in the Disdian army, and presumably he was also, just like Akatsuki, originally a native of Earth before coming to Alayzard. After the demonic tribes that remained after the defeat of Maou Galious begin to grow restive, a council of the kingdoms of Alayzard realize that this is because they know that their king`s daughter still lives. The council decided, against Queen Risty`s objections, to send Phil to Earth to destroy Miu and Akatsuki.\nIn battle he uses a poisoned sword. He made a contract with the dragon Zahhaku, and is capable of using the dragon`s powers, even transforming into dragon form.",
