  "description" : "Kouhei`s little sister and a member of the Games Research club, as well as Ruri`s classmate. Similar to Kirino, she has an obsession with eroges, albeit she prefers the yaoi genre to an extent that she`ll even fantasise about her other clubmates, pairing her brother and Kyousuke as a couple. The relationship she has with her brother is quite strong yet unclear how they feel each other. She joined the Games Research club in order to learn how to become a games designer. She is also very good at games, having the high score before Kuroneko beat it. This also attributes to her skill in programming being able to debug very easily.",
