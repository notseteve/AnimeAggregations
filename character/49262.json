  "description" : "The colony ships that pioneered the great migration into space eventually grew into entire fleets of vessels with populations in excess of a million people. As the size of these colonization fleets increased the time spent traveling through space became a more important consideration for the effect upon the populace. Specialized vessels were built to help fulfill the needs of the colonists who could be traveling to habitable planets for years before settling. The Riviera Resort Ships were designed as vacation vessels, with hotels and casinos for high-class leisure. These large spaceships are over 6 kilometers long and are designed for marine life cultivation and breeding. Underneath a massive transparent dome an artificial 3.6km diameter ocean has been built with a coastline over 10 kilometers long. The forward section includes a large starport for visiting craft and numerous searchlights dot the exterior hull.\nAs large and important vessels carrying some 100,000 people, the Riviera ships feature defensive options to be used in the event of an emergency. The transparent dome can be covered with an armored shell to protect the population inside and the forward section of the ship is built with a dock to accommodate an Uraga Class Escort Battle Carrier. When the 7th New Macross-Class battleship departed with the 37th long-distance colonization fleet in 2038, a Riviera Resort Ship was among the vessels under its command. The Riviera was also part of the Milky Road inter-ship network which helped ferry small passenger and transport ships in between the vessels of the fleet.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/riviera-resortship.htm",
