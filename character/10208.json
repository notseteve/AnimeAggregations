  "description" : "Kamon Nandaba is Naota`s father, a former pop culture journalist working as a freelance writer, with his own trashy tabloid: \"Kamon-Mabase\" (the title is a pun of \"come-on mabase\"). He makes the most references to pop culture: EVA, \"Monkey-sensei\" (referring to the creator of the series Lupin III), Hamtaro, Mobile Suit Gundam, and MTV to name a few.\nKamon has taken a liking to Haruko, but she only wants to use him as an N.O. portal. In the fourth episode, Naota discovers that Haruko tried to use him but \"his head didn`t work\" and that she had left a robot replacement to putter around the house. The real Kamon is found conservated (dehydrated) in a cabinet but is brought back to life by being contacted with water in a small bathtub. Haruko`s true intentions of coming to Mabase are revealed through her interactions with Kamon. After realizing that his head didn`t open the N.O. portal, she discards him and returns to using Naota, saying \"you`re the only one who works.\" Like the other adults in FLCL, Kamon is extremely immature, normally more so than the other adults. However, he shows a surprising amount of seriousness and thoughtfulness at some points in the anime.",
