  "description" : "A perverted Bishop, he saves Teito`s life when Teito falls from his hawkzile. He is the member of the 07-Ghosts and is known as Zehel. He finds Mikage (as a small pink dragon) for Teito and accidentally becomes Teito`s master when he attempts to remove Teito`s promise collar, invoking a blood contract. This collar gives Frau the ability to use three commands on Teito: bind, sleep and pain. For all his teasing, Frau also keeps Teito`s spirits up with impromptu pep talks. Because of this, Teito sometimes makes associations between Frau and his late father. His relation with Ayanami is as of yet unknown. Frau is the only Ghost who can wield Ayanami`s scythe.",
