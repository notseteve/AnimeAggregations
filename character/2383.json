  "description" : "Krad is the complete opposite of Dark (with even Dark`s name spelt backwards) and also Dark`s worst enemy. Krad is the homicidal blond of the series who is the alter-ego of Hiwatari Satoshi. Apparently, Daisuke was the reason that Satoshi first transformed into Krad. With (Wiz) absolutely despises Krad and always tries to attack him on sight. Krad can be called insanely obsessive, as he attempts to kill Daisuke after their first encounter because he is very possessive over his host, Satoshi, and does not let him get close to anyone. He affectionately calls him, \"My everything\". Satoshi, however - like his whole family generation - despises Krad.",
