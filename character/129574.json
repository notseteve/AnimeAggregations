  "description" : "Druddigon is Ryuki`s Pok√©mon. The battle verses Ash Ketchum started off in a Single Battle of Ryuki`s Zweilous against Ash`s Rowlet but when Ash`s Meltan ate part of Ryuki`s boots, the battle expanded to a Double Battle and Ryuki`s Druddigon joined the battle. It ended up losing as Rowlet learned Brave Bird during the battle and it proved to be too powerful for it and Ryuki`s Zweilous.",
