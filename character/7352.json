  "description" : "The catalyst for http://anidb.net/ch7002 [Juri]`s current broken state of mind. She simultaneously idolises Juri for her brilliance and despises her for it. Her extreme lack of self-worth is the reason for the rocky relationship between the two, and it reaches a breaking point when http://anidb.net/ch9206 [Ruka] re-enters Ootori academy.\nJuri`s childhood friend. http://anidb.net/ch7352 [Shiori] left the school after stealing the man she believed to be Juri`s boyfriend in order to feel more powerful than her, leaving Juri devastated (contrary to Shiori`s initial beliefs, however, Juri is hurt because of her love for Shiori). Shiori is in many ways an innocent character, in denial of her true feelings of admiration for Juri. Due to her inferiority complex, her attitude towards Juri is often downright sadistic (as her schemes are often designed to hurt Juri for no reason other than to see her suffer) and at the same time masochistic (as Shiori hurts herself every time she hurts Juri). Upon discovering Juri`s love for her, Shiori becomes a Black Rose Duellist and pulls her duelling sword from Juri.",
