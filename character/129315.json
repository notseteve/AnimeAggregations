  "description" : "Decidueye is Hau`s main Pokémon partner and the evolved form of Hau`s Dartrix. It evolved from Dartrix just in time for the Alola League.\nThe Second match of the Alola Pokémon League quarterfinals featured Hau`s Decidueye verses Ash`s Rowlet. Just before the battle, Toucannon and friends brought Rowlet a cape and helped it learn the move Feather Dance. Both of them used their Z-Moves early on in the battle but the ferocious, heated battle continued on. After Brave Bird and Sky Attack clashed, it looked like Ash`s Rowlet had lost the match and Nanu had actually called the match but the chief referee Hala realized that Rowlet hadn`t been knocked out yet and was just sleeping, so they continued the match and Rowlet mastered using Feather Dance to avoid a Sky Attack and countered with another Brave Bird to come from behind to win the match.",
