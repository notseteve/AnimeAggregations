  "description" : "The main villain in http://anidb.net/a2151 [Sailor Moon S Movie]. The name \"Princess Snow Kaguya\" is given to her by http://anidb.net/ch55412 [ Oozora Kakeru], the astronomer who first discovered the comet she is living at. Therefore, it is not her real name, which is not revealed or mentioned at all.\nOnce repelled from taking over the Earth by bright light in past, the Ice Queen - Princess Snow Kaguya - returns to add the Earth to her collection of frozen worlds. Sending a fragment of her comet to the Earth, she slowly starts to freeze the planet with all the livings. The fragment (a crystal of some sort) is the key for an immediate freezing of the planet, but she loses it out of her sight as it is grabbed by Kakeru who thinks of it as of an interesting meteorite and wants to analyze it. Therefore, she sends her minions - Snow Dancers - to find it.\nEven though she manages to find the crystal before http://anidb.net/ch7321 [Sailor Moon] and to freeze the Earth, she is defeated and destroyed by Sailor Soldiers at the end.\nNote: Princess Kaguya is a character from Japanese folklore since she is the main character of an old Japanese legend - The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. For further information, see e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter.",
