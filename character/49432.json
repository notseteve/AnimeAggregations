  "description" : "Silat is a highly skilled and agile Kushan fighter first encountered by http://anidb.net/ch650 [Guts] in the Golden Age Arc. He is the leader of the Bakiraka clan and the impressive http://anidb.net/ch82448 [Tapasa] group are his bodyguards.\nHe claims to be a man with a \"bird`s eye view of things\". Though he says that his clan abandoned self esteem when they chose to be assassins, he is shown to be proud of his abilities and also of his clan.\nHis combat style is similar to Kalarippayattu (a martial arts form existing in South India) and uses many Indian weapons used by Rajput warriors, though Guts has referred to him as a circus performer due to Silat`s exotic appearance, acrobatics and his almost theatrical tendency to call out his attacks. Despite Guts` mockery, Silat is one of the strongest human warriors in Midland and among his race the Kushans too, as he defeated many knights in the tournament and overpowered http://anidb.net/ch654 [Casca] later as well as killing a few trained Hawk members. Silat`s skill only fell short when faced with the overwhelming strength of Guts, who he now considers his rival.\nSource: Berserk Wiki",
