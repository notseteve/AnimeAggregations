  "description" : "The primary female protagonist of the series.\nShe`s generally very shy and demure, addressing Kaoru as \"Kaoru-sama\". Also, she`s usually portrayed wearing a kimono; specifically, an indigo one.\nBecause she`s a very good cook and keeps her house in a very clean state, she`s seen as a Yamato Nadeshiko (traditional Japanese beauty).\nUnlike other female leads in harem anime, she works to control her jealousy and is generally successful. She`s very devoted to Kaoru, however, and will do all in her power to prevent being separated from him.\nIn the beginning, Aoi was willing to warm him when he had a fever, becoming nude in the process (she made sure he wasn`t looking).\nWhen Aoi, Kaoru, and Miyabi moved to the Sakuraba`s summer estate the public appearance Miyabi wanted was that Aoi would be the landlady, herself the manager, and Kaoru a tenant.\nWhen Tina Foster moved in, Aoi and Miyabi became a real landlord and manager.\nAoi has a quiet but strong willfulness. Many viewers have mistaken this for weakness or subservience due to her mild temperament. She has a \"bad\" habit of clutching things in her sleep.\nAoi`s given name (aoi) has the same pronunciation as the Japanese word for \"blue\" (青), but the kanji used (葵) translates to \"hollyhock\".\nHer surname (桜庭 sakuraba) means \"cherry-blossom garden\", and her given name means \"hollyhock flower\".",
