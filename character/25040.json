  "description" : "It`s the second model in the Grungust series. The Grungust`s Gustlander mode was omitted in order to allow for greater efficiency. EOT was used in its development.\nIts armor surpasses all PTs and AMs that were created before it, and it`s even capable of creating a TK Field due to the T-Link System that it`s equipped with. It`s able to transform into the G-Hawk mode, which allows it to fly. The transformation mechanism is the same as the one that`s found in the R series machines. Because of this, it`s able to transform much faster than the original Grungust model.",
