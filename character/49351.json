  "description" : "A middle class vessel, the Mark Twain VII Resort Ship has a distinct retro designed exterior owing much to the period of the ship`s namesake. The Resort Ship operates throughout the fleet, cruising among the various ships and as such it is the most recognizable leisure facility among the colonists of the 37th long-distance colonization fleet. The Mark Twain operates without the aid of any attached carriers or frigates.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/marktwain.htm",
