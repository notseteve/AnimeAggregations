  "description" : "Kyu is a bright, sweet and optimistic boy who is also a brilliant detective, but a little awkward in social situations. Otherwise, he is considered to be the team`s leader and is known for his logical explanations of cases. His motto (taught by Renjou Satoru (his father)) - \"A Detective must never give up or the case will remain unsolved\". He has a good sense of judgment regarding people (when everyone distrusted Ryuu, he expressed his open appreciation for him) but often says things that infuriate Megumi such as look at the colour of her panties. But even though he acts this way, he cares for her, as shown when they were trapped in a secret door in the old school building. He did everything he could to help Megumi as she struggled after getting bitten by a pit viper, even opening up the pipe system to send Ryu and the others an SOS. In addition, another such running gag of Kyu`s is his constant misinterpretation of the Japanese language (for example, he said \"training pants\" when he heard the words \"tore han,\" which means \"treasure hunting\").\nSource: Wiki",
