  "description" : "Boris is Balalaika`s second-in-command. He can be easily identified by the large scar running from the right side of his forehead to his left cheek. He is a calm, broad-built man with a deep Russian accent. Like Balalaika, he had served in the former Soviet army in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. She still refers to him as \"Sergeant\" rather than by his name, suggesting that he was her former platoon sergeant. He is very loyal and protective of Balalaika and often worries for her safety when she decides to fight in the field,as seen in episode 15. In an Omake, he used to be a weak girlish looking boy before joining the army.",
