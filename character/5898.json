  "description" : "Shingo is a bit older than his band mates but tends to be the least mature. He lives with his best friend and band mate http://anidb.net/ch5899 [Jun]. The two are very different and equal one another out. He plays guitar in http://anidb.net/ch40597 [T.L.Signal] and helps write the songs. He is playful and optimistic about the band`s future. Out of the band he is the loudest and most energetic. He likes the ladies and enjoys their attention. He is personable to everyone and never seems to meet a stranger.",
