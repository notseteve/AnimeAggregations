  "description" : "A good friend of Misaki`s and one of the few female students at Seika High, Sakura is friendly and cheerful and, like the rest of the girls, relies on Misaki for protection from the wild behaviour of the boys. She is quite popular amongst the boys, but frequently rejects their confessions; in particular, she`s rejected ex-rugby captain Gouda Masaru (剛田将) one hundred times. According to Shizuko, Sakura falls in love without carefully considering what the person is really like, as exampled by her persistent feelings for the two-faced, womanising singer of a popular band from a nearby high school.",
