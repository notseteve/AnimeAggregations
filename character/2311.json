  "description" : "Shirase Akira is the main character of the story. He is a very quiet individual, living by himself in a small apartment not far from his great-niece`s house. In the hacking world, Akira is known as Battle Programmer Shirase. He is pretty much a genius in both computer hacking and security. As long as he has any sort of electronic device, Akira can do anything. His signature finishing move is the Double Compile.\nHe is also a hard-core otaku (willing to spend his last 1000 yen on doujinshi) with a particular liking for nekomimi and cat-girls. He also has a big crush on Misao.",
