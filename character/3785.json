  "description" : "Kunio is a man who feels that one`s life shouldn`t be wasted completely on working. He gets his job done but, unlike Hiroko, he doesn`t feel that one should devote their whole life to just work. While there are several people who clash with Hiroko throughout the series, Kunio is probably one of those that repeats the most, if only for their complete difference in work ethic.",
