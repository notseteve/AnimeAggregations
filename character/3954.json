  "description" : "A highly experienced, educated, fearless and skilled swordsmaster, Kanbee is the embodiment of everything a great samurai should be. Yet, he considers himself a failure. He fought for the losing side of the war, where he was in a key role. After the ensuing collapse of the samurai age, Kanbee felt \"like an empty shell, a hollow remnant living long after it`s served its use.\" Having no master, having no cause, and being ashamed for losing and for surviving when others died, he felt like his life should already be over, until http://anidb.net/ch3961 [Kirara] managed to enlist his help for the defense of Kanna Village.",
