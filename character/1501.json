  "description" : "An island nation in the southern Pacific Ocean, which possesses considerable industrial and military power despite its small size and lack of natural resources. Its assets include high technology, an abundant supply of geothermal energy thanks to its numerous active volcanoes, and a policy of nondiscrimination against Coordinators which has enriched Orb`s talent pool. The Orb Union also has its own mass driver and controls its own space colony, the resource satellite Heliopolis.\nIn Orb`s complex political system, power is shared between an elected assembly and representatives of the five noble families who originally ruled over the islands.",
