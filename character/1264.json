  "description" : "Probopass, known as the Compass Pokémon, is one of several Pokémon from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl that evolves from a Pokémon that was released in a previous generation. Probopass evolves from a Nosepass that has leveled up on Mt. Coronet. Probopass resembles the Groucho Marx comical glasses in some aspects, with small round eyes, in contrast to Nosepass`s perpetually closed ones. It also bears a small resemblance to the Nintendo character Mario.[citation needed] Its nose is much bigger in proportion to its body and has a bushy \"moustache.\" The \"moustache\" appears to be iron filings caught by a magnet. Female Probopass retain the \"moustache\", despite the existence of gender differences for various different Pokémon species. It controls three small objects on its sides and back that look like Nosepass, which are not connected to the body; they are called \"mini-noses\" by the in-game Pokédex entry.",
