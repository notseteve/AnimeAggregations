  "description" : "The Maurya was the http://anidb.net/ch1535 [Alliance] flagship of Rear Admiral http://anidb.net/ch808 [Guen van Hugh]. Pennant number E-5.\nThe Maurya served as a squadron flagship, joining the http://anidb.net/ch96406 [Yang Fleet] at its formation in late 796 UC. Its first engagement following this was at the Battle of Doria Starzone, where Commodore Guen`s squadron was instrumental in cutting the http://anidb.net/ch96433 [11th Fleet]`s formation in two.\nBy 798 UC, the Maurya had been repainted with a distinctive `tiger-stripe` livery, and it defended http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] at the Eighth Battle of Iserlohn. Following the Alliance victory, Rear Admirals Guen and http://anidb.net/ch901 [Alarcon] led their respective fleets in pursuit of the withdrawing Imperial forces, intending to eliminate the few remaining ships. However, both fleets were destroyed by Imperial reinforcements â€” the Maurya itself was sunk by the Reuenthal Fleet.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
