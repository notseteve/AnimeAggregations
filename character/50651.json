  "description" : "Riiku`s Mogurew was first seen popping out of the ground in front of Ash and his friends who were on their way to Higaki City where the Isshu League was to be held. Together with its trainer Riiku, the earth warrior Mogurew controls everything on land. During tag battles, Riiku`s Mogurew pairs up with Soran`s Warrgle and they use a combination of moves for their attacks and name them appropriate to what the combination produces.\nRiiku`s Mogurew had a tag battle against Cilan`s Pansage and Ash`s Unfezant. The move combinations proved to be effective in the tag battle against Ash and Cilan until they also decided to use their own combination of moves which ended up overpowering Soran`s Warrgle and Riiku`s Mogurew and they lost the tag battle.",
