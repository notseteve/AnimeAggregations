  "description" : "Tsuchigumo joined Hagoromo-Gitsune to fight someone strong. He was sealed by Hidemoto Keikain 400 years ago and is described by Hidemoto as an ayakashi that must not be encountered. He is tremendously strong, able to defeat Rikuo and his Hyakki Yakou easily and without any signs of injury. Hidemoto only managed to seal him by tricking him into a deep sleep 400 years ago. When Tsuchigumo is hungry, he will devour anything, whether it is human, youkai or God. He seems to be the only one who remembers the Great Tengu of Mount Kurama. It is probable that this is due to him being sealed before Minagoroshi Jizou started to alter everyone`s memories.",
