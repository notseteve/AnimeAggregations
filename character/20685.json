  "description" : "The most intellectual of the four, Takenaga is called the \"Boss\" (a pun on his personal name in Japanese, which can be read as buchou, meaning \"boss\") by his friends and is the least fazed by Sunako`s morbid habits. When the quartet dress Sunako up, Takenaga is usually responsible for doing Sunako`s hair. Takenaga was originally from a wealthy family descended from flower masters (ikebana), but when the pressure of being the family heir was too much, he became completely withdrawn and ignored everyone. He was sent to live at the Landlady`s mansion in hopes of becoming more \"normal\". He is described as a caring feminist and is rather shy. He is currently going out with Noi, whom he affectionately calls \"Noi-chi\". His name is derived from Oda Nobunaga (in fact it was once suggested in the anime that Takenaga was a direct descendant of Nobunaga) and his reference to Noi as \"Noi-chi\" is probably a reference to Oichi, a sister of Nobunaga.",
