  "description" : "Ryuu is a genius bartender who helps the people who come into his bar. Although not thoroughly explained at first, Ryuu actually runs the bar by himself, and Eden Hall was his first bar. He worked as an assistant for a senior bartender before he opened Eden Hall, and that gave him the experience he needed to handle the job.\nOften, Ryuu maintains his composure and throughout the story, puts on a brave and sincere effort to help the customers who fret and seem disturbed in his bar. He has been shown to handle all sorts of spirits and know most of the history of the drinks he serves. Ryuu is also known to serve the \"Glass of the Gods\", and being entitled to this, made Eden Hall a pleasurable venue for customers seeking the menu of their hearts.\n[Source: wiki]",
