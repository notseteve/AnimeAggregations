As such, it is one of the few organizations aware of the Whispered and Black Technology.\nMithril remains an extremely secretive organization, its existence unknown to all but the most senior of military and political personnel. Its motives, funding, structure, and personnel are all kept secret. Its secrecy is vital for its continued existence, as Mithril is a specialist organization dependent on fast surgical strikes with small numbers. They do not possess the numbers or capacity to withstand a conventional war of numbers.\nThe story of Full Metal Panic primarily follows one section of Mithril, the Pacific Fleet Battle Group Tuatha de Danaan.",
