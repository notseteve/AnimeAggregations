He was born in Malaga, Spain, and although he did not have the glory of a knight or king or the recognition of having produced works of art that would prosper for thousands of years, he was the father of an entire thaumaturgical system, Kabbalah, and one of the starting points of the process leading up to the European Renaissance through bringing Greco-Arabic and Jewish lore and enlightenment to the cultural circles of Europe. He is recognized as a \"hero\" who heavily influenced both the history of the world and thaumaturgy.\nIn anime, he is able to manufacture golems and thus given enough time is an army unto himself. His only wish is to see his Noble Phantasm (an actual living Golem) succeed. His Noble Phantasm is Golem Keter Malkuth, which allows him to construct the ultimate golem.[/spoiler]\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
