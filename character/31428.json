  "description" : "Tilel is Wolx Hound`s Edel Raid. She appears as a tiny girl with two large red disks in her green hair. Even though Wolx claims she is just a \"tool\" and he can replace her anytime, she insists that he is the strongest, smartest, and sharpest man alive and becomes jealous when Wolx was inspecting Kuea`s gelade. She is fixed on nobly protecting Wolx from harm to her highest extent, and vows to travel together side by side with Wolx, no matter the circumstances. Tilel has the unique ability to distinguish who is an Edel Raid, helping Wolx with his line of work. In her reacted form, she appears as a giant toy pico-pico hammer. The hammer can disassemble into twelve hovering disks which can block and attack from a distance. She is classified as a djinn defender because she is an Edel Raid of defensive superiority.\nIn the anime, it is revealed that she lived a life of poverty until she was taken in by Wolx. At the anime`s end, she and Wolx are now working for Arc Aile.",
