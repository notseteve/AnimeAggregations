  "description" : "Beatrice`s butler and head furniture. He is a high ranked earl of hell named after the demon of the same name. He often serves black tea and cookies to Beatrice and her guests. Nonchalant, he often bears a mysterious smile that is hard to interpret, even for his master. Even though he is bound by contract with Beatrice, he does not hesitate to state facts to tease her. He claims to be linked to Ronoue Genji. A skilled combatant, he fights using barriers for both attack and defence, generating strong ones to both deflect attacks and launch enemies backwards. He can also use a special barrier that returns damage back to the attacker.",
