  "description" : "A mysterious woman replacing Elizabeth (who just so happens to be her sister) as Igor`s assistant after the latter had set off on a journey. After establishing the Social Link with her, she requests the Protagonist to create a certain Persona with a certain skill from fusion, as a euphemism for drawing out those aspects of the protagonist`s personality.
