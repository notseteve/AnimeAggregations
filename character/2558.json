  "description" : "Hikaru`s biggest rival and Kaio Middle School student, Akira is already a very strong go player when Hikaru first begins playing. Yet, he is amazed by Hikaru`s seemingly impossibly deep game and becomes obsessed with discovering the secret behind his strength. Meanwhile, Hikaru is impressed with how serious and focused Akira is for being only a 6th grader like him. As the series goes along, the plot brings these two characters together to play each other under many circumstances, each time adding to the mystery.\nAdapted from Wikipedia",
