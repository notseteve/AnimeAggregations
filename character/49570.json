  "description" : "In the era following the launch of the Megaroad-01 in 2012, the UNG decided to abandon the larger, heavier variable vehicles like the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] in favor of a move toward lighter and more advanced variable fighters such as the VF-5000 Star Mirage and the VF-11 Thunderbolt. However, development resources and military needs were such that building other variable fighters remained a necessity. Beginning in 2025, General Galaxy/Messer began development of the VF-14 Vampire based on Stonewell Bellcom`s http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] and incorporating Zentradi technology into conventional OverTechnology. First flight took place in 2027 and mass production began in 2028. By 2030, the VF-14 had entered active service and during the peak of deployment the Vampire served as main variable fighter on colonization, survey and other fleets. Though the design has been succeeded by next generation variable fighters, the VF-14 Vampire continues production under license at various colonies and other locations. The VF-14 was a fighter design in the \"Nova Project\" competition but lost to the VF-11 Thunderbolt as the variable fighter to replace the http://anidb.net/ch49112 [VF-4 Lightning III] as the next main fighter. However, the Vampire was found useful on frontier immigration planets and emigrant fleets because it excelled in cruising performance in space and its airframe was easy to maintain. These factors lead to mass production of the VF-14 Vampire.\nSource: http://www.macross2.net/m3/macross7/vf-14-m7plus.htm",
