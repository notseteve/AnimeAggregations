  "description" : "Dejiko`s five year old sidekick and a catgirl. Puchiko is quiet and has a Type B personality. She has the ability to use an eye-beam similar to Dejiko`s but is often too docile to conjure the aggression required to perform such a feat. This has caused many things to come out of her eyes, including sludge, when she attempts to use it.\nPuchiko has brown hair and dark brown eyes. She wears a schoolgirl-type uniform plus cat bells in her hair, though they are much smaller than Dejiko`s. She wears orange boots, cat ears and tail. She ends each sentence with nyu.",
