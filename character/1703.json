  "description" : "Described as being \"Most stuff unknown Part-time teacher here and also very skilled magician.\" He is an easy-going teacher that helps out Takuto and Suzuho. He is clearly a powerful magician, evidence of this is when he easily broke the barrier that Miyabe and Synclavia erected and even overpowered them. He is also well-knowledge of the use of magic, since he was able to summon a black demon lord to do his bidding. However, his personality and behavior is a bit of a pervert, and also an otaku and often joining in on Professor Franken Stein`s perverted schemes. He appears to prefer the paws of animal girls to the point that he even made battle gloves for Tanarot in the shape of cat`s paws, and maid outfits which is why he dressed up Eneus, Miyabe, and Synclavia as maids. So much in fact that he works with his perverted hobbies more than he does actual work, as stated by Eneus.",
