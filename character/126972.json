  "description" : "Cerah is the most famous Pokémon Sled jumper from the Alola region. She was practicing on a trail on Ula`ula Island near Mount Lanakila for her next big competition when Lillie`s Vulpix (Snowy) sensed her Ninetales. Sophocles recognized her right away and asked to shake her hand. She invited Lillie to join in a Pokémon Sled Jump event happening the next day.\nShe met up with everyone and helped them train for the race by going to the jump she had been practicing on since she was a kid. After Lillie crashed on her first jump, Cerah told her when she was younger, she also had a spectacular wipeout and got scared of jumping. Cerah explained that her mother wanted her to take piano lessons, but when a friend of hers entered a Pokémon Sled Jump competition, she half-heartedly started practicing for it. Her Vulpix helped her build the courage to try sledding again after the crash.\nDubbed the Silver-Haired Glider by the event announcer, she was the special guest at the Pokémon Sled Jump Games and performed an exhibition jump.",
