  "description" : "Leon`s Mr. Rime was the third Pok√©mon used in the Masters Eight tournament finals. It was sent out to face Ash`s Gengar after it defeated Leon`s Inteleon. Although it was affected by Cursed Body and it disabled its Freeze-Dry move, Mr. Rime was able to defeat Gengar through a combination of it being Frozen and its Expanding Force move being powered up by Psychic Terrain. It then faced Ash`s Mega Lucario, after a few moments against Ash`s Sirfetch`d who had damaged the ice before being switched out. Lucario was able to sense its incoming move and used an Aura Sphere which hit it from behind to knock it out.",
