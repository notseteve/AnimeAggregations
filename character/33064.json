  "description" : "Kodama means \"echo\" (its literal meaning is a \"tree spirit\"). However, since its name is written in Katakana, not in Kanji, it could also mean \"small ball\" or \"small spirit\". They (there are many, in various sizes and shapes) are a kind of spirit who live in the forest. Although Kodama (a tree spirit) appears in many Japanese folktales, Kodama as a little white creature is Miyazaki`s creation.",
