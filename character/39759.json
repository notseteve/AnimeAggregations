  "description" : "Pumpkin Doryu is the founder of the Doryu Ghost Squad and holder of its top position. He holds one of the five True dark brings, a piece of Sinclaire itself with powers greater than the ordinary Dark Bring. His dark bring, Vampire gives him complete control over the forces of gravity and repulsion which lets him, at the most extreme, pull physical matter into darkness (which he did to Musica). He first fought Haru in Volume 15, and he nearly killed Haru with the Twilight sword. The second time they fought in Volume 17, Haru seemed to have gained some new strength (he might have gotten stronger as a result to losing the first match), and he destroyed the Twilight sword and the Jet Black sword. Haru also received some help from his friends, but it ended up being a one on one fight between Haru and Doryu. Haru was able to overcome the pain of his earlier injuries, destroyed Doryu`s most powerful spell (which would have killed Haru and all of his friends), broke through the Vampire`s power of repulsion, and he killed Doryu with the Million Suns. After this point, Haru was stronger than Doryu.",
