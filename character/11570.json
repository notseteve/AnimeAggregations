  "description" : "Noihara Himari, also called Noihara the Crimson Blade, is a white cat demon that played with Yuuto during his childhood when he stayed at his grandparents house. She can change her form from human to cat, even halfway, having a human body but with distinctive cat features. When Yuuto asked why her hair is black even though she is a white cat, she admits in her mind that she modelled it after Kuesu but she also says that she would rather have her mouth ripped off then admit that. Armed with Yasutsuna, a katana from Yuuto`s grandparents, she is quite skilful when it comes to close combat.\nHimari has loved Yuuto since his childhood and she often flirts with him. Himari forms a stronger bond with Yuuto after he remembers his time in the past with her. If she loses her sanity in battle, Himari can turn into an uncontrollable bloodlust human-devouring demon cat.",
