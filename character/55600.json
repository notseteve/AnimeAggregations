  "description" : "Cheetu (ヂートゥ) is a cheetah-like Chimera Ant squadron leader with unparalleled speed, allowing him to dodge bullets with ease and rapidly punch experienced Hunters before they can even move. He is among the Chimera Ants who eat humans meant for the Queen. Compared to the other Chimera Ants, Cheetu is very simpleminded and egotistical with no agenda of his own while simply content with being the fastest.\nSource: Wikipedia",
