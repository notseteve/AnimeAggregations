  "description" : "Shion Pavlichenko is http://anidb.net/ch12051 [Suou]`s twin brother. He was believed to have lost his right eye due to an accident with a falling meteor core fragment during the Tokyo explosion, and that this incident also turned him into a Contractor. It is later revealed that he was in fact born a Contractor, a unique occurrence according to Mao`s words, and that the meteorite incident was actually a fake memory he put into his sister`s mind. His remuneration is to be forced to use a wheelchair every time he uses his power. The full nature of Shion`s powers have not been revealed, however, it has recently been revealed that the current Suou is actually a `copy` he created with his power. He also displays telepathic abilities, being able to mentally contact his sister and instruct her in how to get to safety during an attack on their home; they could also be traces left in his sister memories and triggered by events he and his father planned ahead. He leaves behind a clue for Suou telling her he has left for Japan. He is reunited with Suou in Hell`s Gate, where he wishes for a world where Suou can live a normal life before being killed by Izanami. When it is revealed later however, that Shion was born a Contractor and did not obtain his Contractor abilities during the Tokyo explosion, it is confirmed he apparently lost his right side in some kind of meteor incident when he was outdoor with his father.",
