  "description" : "The most arrogant, aggressive and most violent of all the Blade Children, Kousuke is usually the implementer of assassinations. Kousuke is very strong-willed and stubborn, choosing to fight the Hunters head-on rather than hide from them. He is not afraid to kill and does not really trust Eyes, resulting in arguments between them. While Rio Takeuchi calls him stupid, in reality Kousuke is very intelligent; after skipping most of elementary school, he still manages to catch up to secondary school level from reading and learning from books. Kousuke left middle school after a run in with a teacher. He is a childhood friend of Ryoko Takamachi.",
