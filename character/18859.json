  "description" : "An assistant inspector from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, this charming lady first appeared in the last few episodes of Season 1 with a car theft case in tow. A strict, no-nonsense kind of person, she initially comes off as cold-hearted, but beneath that imposing demeanor is actually a woman who is selflessly dedicated to her duties and those that fall under her command. She is ready to help the females of Bokuto Station and is approachable whenever she is around at the station.\nDuring the course of her career, Kaoruko had participated in at least one Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Color Guard parade.",
