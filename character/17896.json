  "description" : "Kawara Sousuke is http://anidb.net/ch17599 [Heitarou]`s pubescent son, heir to the Kawara Clan`s leadership. He is hasty and impetuous, not a surprise for his age and the shame his father has to endure. He has strong feelings for http://anidb.net/ch17897 [Osuzu], and intervenes when http://anidb.net/ch17598 [Ishimatsu] comes to collect her http://anidb.net/ch17894 [father]`s business deed, succeeding only in getting her taken away, too. Joins forces with http://anidb.net/ch4864 [Jin] to rescue her but fail as http://anidb.net/ch4865 [Mugen] is guarding the brothel. The night after he goes to see Osuzu again and blows a gasket when a customer puts his hands on her. The man is a http://anidb.net/ch17597 [Nagatomi], but Sousuke does not know that when he draws his sword and stabs him to death. Heitarou commits seppuku on his account. Rikiei mocks Heitarou, while Sousuke defends him. Upon the Nagatomi Clan`s defeat, he assumes his father`s position.\nSource: Wikipedia",
