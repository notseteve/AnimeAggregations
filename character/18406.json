  "description" : "Pluto, also known as the devil Dog, is a shapeshifter who appears in the form of a human and a large dog that first terrorized the town of Houndsworth, until Sebastian tames him and brings him to the Phantomhive Estate. As a dog, he can breathe fire and walk through barriers. As a human, he still retains dog-like behaviour.\nAlthough Sebastian says that he hates dogs, Pluto has taken a liking to him and only listens to Sebastian`s orders. He has ties to the organization that killed Ciel`s parents, as he is seen resting by the feet of a member and licking his hand and has been with Angela prior to living at the Phantomhive Estate. When Ash uses him to set fire to the Estate and burn London, Ciel orders his staff to kill Pluto.",
