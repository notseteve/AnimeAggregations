  "description" : "Kohaku is Sango`s younger brother. Disguised as the young nobleman Kagewaki Hitomi, Naraku summons Sango`s family and companions to slay a false demon, then controls Kohaku with a Shikon shard and makes him kill all of the other demon slayers (Sango survives solely by sheer luck). Castle guards also kill Kohaku that night.\nNaraku resurrects him as an amnesiac puppet, but after several encounters with Sango and her friends, Kohaku begins to recover his painful memories. Kagura helps him escape from Naraku, who kills her for the defection. Hoping to redeem himself, Kohaku travels with Kikyou until she tells him he must leave her to keep his shard pure. He later joins Sesshomaru`s group and becomes Rin`s friend and co-protector.",
