  "description" : "Basara is one of the Juunishinshou who specializes in archery. He can fire more arrows than usual, all with accurate aiming. While doing this, his front is exposed. To overcome this, he prepares arrow traps that surround him, so an opponent cannot get close to him. In his ultimate attack, he fires his entire quiver with one shot (about 50 arrows). He was defeated by Sanada Yukimura, who sliced him in half.\nHis real name was Maro and he spoke in third person, causing confusion as to his name.",
