  "description" : "Lemmler was an http://anidb.net/ch1534 [Imperial] commander who served as a staff officer at http://anidb.net/ch1762 [Iserlohn Fortress] under Admiral http://anidb.net/ch746 [Thoma von Stockhausen]. When the disguised Alliance soldiers arrived at the fortress command center, he insisted on checking their identifications, though ended up being overruled by the admiral. His worry proved correct when http://anidb.net/ch748 [Walter von Sch√∂nkopf] took Stockhausen hostage and used him to compel the Imperials to stand down. Lemmler presumably ended up in an Alliance prison camp after Iserlohn was captured.\nSource: Gineipaedia",
