  "description" : "The psychokinesis user of the 17th platoon and a 2nd year. She is very anti-social and not very talkative and shows little emotion, as psychokinesis users receive a great influx of information in their brains, and their minds can`t handle it if they react to every little thing, and restrict the flow of their nerves unconsciously. Because of this, she has a hard time making common facial expressions, such as smiling.",
