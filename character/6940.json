  "description" : "The third Angel, Sachiel, is the first Angel to attack Tokyo-3. It is a massive, vaguely humanoid creature with large bony structures on its shoulders and torso, gill-like structures on its legs, tridactyl hands, and a distinctive beaked face (a second face, behind and slightly to the side of the first one, is generated after an N² bomb is dropped on the Angel). It has a powerful long-range energy blast, which distinctly forms a Christian cross on detonation, and two sharp spikes which slide through its arms and extend through holes in its palms as striking weapons (when retracted, the spikes extend from the Angel`s elbows) Its core is located prominently on its chest.\nAfter easily defeating the UN military forces sent to attack it, Sachiel was briefly stopped by an N² bomb, from which it quickly recovered. It then fought Unit 01, in Ikari Shinji`s first battle against an Angel. Initially, Sachiel defeated Unit 01, driving a spike through the Eva`s head. However, the Eva went \"berserk\", re-engaged Sachiel, and inflicted massive damage to the Angel`s core with a broken piece of one of Sachiel`s ribs. The Angel then attached itself to Unit 01 and self-destructed, but failed to destroy Unit 01.\nSachiel demonstrates impressive regenerative abilities, recovering from an N² bomb in a matter of hours. The Angel also seems to have a limited ability to alter its own body structure, as demonstrated when it bulges its arm muscles to stop a missile, when it snaps Unit 01`s arm, and when it partly envelops Unit 01 and self-destructs.",
