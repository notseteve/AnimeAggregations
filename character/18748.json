  "description" : "The Phantom Lord Guild was a long time rival of the Fairy Tail Guild. Phantom Lord vandalized the Fairy Tail main building, and the attack was led by the second strongest mage of the guild, Gajeel. The two guilds have had many brushes in the past, but this was the first time Phantom Lord attacked them directly. Phantom Lord also has a S-class group called the Element 4, which are similar to the four S-class mages of Fairy Tail: Erza Scarlet, Laxus Dreyar, Mystogan, and Gildarts Clive. Their guild building has six mechanical legs which allow the building to get up and move around. The guild building is also equipped with a magical convergent cannon called Jupiter. The building can also transform into a giant machine known as Super Mage Giant Phantom MK II. When it`s transformed into the Giant Phantom it acts just as a giant mage that can use spells, including forbidden ones.",
