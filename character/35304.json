  "description" : "Silvie Gena is an ace http://anidb.net/ch49124 [Valkyrie II] variable fighter pilot and commander of the Faerie Squadron who, despite being merely 17 years old, is ranked the second finest pilot only after Nexx Gilbert. She has a Meltrandi grandmother, from whom she inherited her prowess at fighting, and becomes very angry at the Marduk when she discovers their use of brainwashing in the Zentradi soldiers that are under their command. She and http://anidb.net/ch35306 [Hibiki] got off with a bad start due to the latter`s pursuit of a scoop on her secret meeting with Supreme Commander Exxegran (where she punched http://anidb.net/ch35306 [Hibiki] in the nose). Her feelings begin to change, however, after crossing paths with him on several occasions during the war against Marduk.\nSource: wiki",
