  "description" : "A somewhat timid girl who is acquainted with Shin, Megumi, and Takurou. She is very interested in Shadow Extraction, and she asked Takurou to do a Shadow Extraction on her, which seems to be a forced invoking of a Persona to create a euphoria similar to taking a drug. She suffers from occasional memory loss where she sometimes cannot remember why she is at a place or even where she is at",
