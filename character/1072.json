It has the ability to freely control ice by freezing moisture in any shape that it wishes. It uses this to instantly freeze enemies and eat them at its leisure.\nIn the anime, Ash Ketchum has a Glalie while in Hoenn. It evolves from his Snorunt, and he keeps it throughout the season. Later, he leaves it at Professor Oak`s lab upon returning from Hoenn.",
