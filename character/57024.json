  "description" : "Minori is a young girl trapped in the world of Elder Tale with her brother Tohya. Her class is \"Kannagi\", a healer dressed as a Japanese shrine maiden whose spells are focused on preventing damage and debuffs to her and her allies instead of just treating them. Minori and her brother met Shiroe on their first day playing Elder Tale and asked him questions about gaining skills and healing spells. Although Shiroe disliked when people ask him for things, after meeting them he decided to teach them about the game and even lowered his avatar`s stats so he could travel with them safely. Minori and her brother were with Shiroe when the Apocalypse began and were separated from Shiroe afterwards. Lost and without anyone to guide them, she and her brother decided to join the guild Hamelin to try to gain experience and levels, but the Hamelin guild masters exploited them (and other low level players) instead. After being rescued, Minori and her brother join Log Horizon and she starts studying Elder Tale`s game mechanics under Shiroe, in order to become a strategist like him, but later realizes that just like Akatsuki, she is in love with him. Her original secondary class is \"Tailor\" but she later switches it to \"Apprentice\", allowing her to become Shiroe`s official disciple and learn some of his skills as well.\nSource: Wiki",
