  "description" : "One of Antonia`s personal maids. She has short, blonde hair and an eyepatch over her right eye. She has an undeniable weakness toward anything cute and catlike and forms an attachment toward one of Eris` Assist-A-Roids. Apparently, it was because of this weakness that she was unable to maintain her former job as a mercenary soldier.\nSource: Wikipedia",
