  "description" : "The self-proclaimed `Sekirei Guardian`, he used to protect `unwinged` Sekirei. Homura`s power and gender were unstable (a running gag throughout the series prior to him being winged was when he`s about to incinerate himself with his own fire, Tsukiumi would suddenly come out of nowhere to douse the engulfing flames); however, he continues to think and act as a man even after his body started becoming female (called `feminization` in the manga). For a long time, he lived under the alias `Kagari`, a popular host club entertainer (because his was looking for an Ashikabi although no, how many women he `meets` he did not react) and only Miya, Uzume, Matsu and Kazehana knew his true identity. Homura began reacting to Minato after he came to the Inn, causing Homura great stress over his potential Ashikabi being male. Near the end of the second stage, he`s revealed to be the last unwinged Sekirei. Homura left the Inn to go after the MBI Director in order to bring an end to the Sekirei Plan. However, he was attacked by multiple Sekirei under orders to capture him. Refusing to be a trophy in the Director`s game, Homura attempted to commit suicide through self-immolation, just as Minato and his Sekirei arrived. Unwilling to let Homura sacrifice himself, Minato `winged` him, saving his life (becoming the only Sekirei, which Minato has kissed willingly). Minato has the power to determine Homura`s gender and mentality, but chooses to let Homura remain who he is for now. Homura has the ability to control and manipulate fire, and is quite powerful, as Tsukiumi speculates him to be the strongest unwinged Sekirei prior to being winged by Minato; \"homura\" means \"flame\" literally.",
