  "description" : "An amphibious mobile suit developed by the Sleeves. It was provided to the terrestrial Zeon remnants led by Kirks. It uses the same basic frame as the Geara Zulu, and its exterior is fitted with underwater equipment such as a vest-shaped diving device, ballast tanks around the neck, hydrojet engines, and underwater fins. The heat knives in its hands, combined with the iron nails attached to its arms, give it the appearance of an amphibious mobile suit with crab-like pincers.",
