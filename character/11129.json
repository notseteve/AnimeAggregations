  "description" : "The Zakrello is a failed mobile armour prototype, whose speed and manoeuvrability were deemed inadequate for combat purposes. The gaping mouth of this peculiar-looking machine contains a powerful scattering mega particle cannon and it`s also armed with eight missile launchers and a pair of sickle-shaped claws. After the destruction of the Bigro, one of Char`s underlings takes off in the Zakrello in an attempt for revenge.",
