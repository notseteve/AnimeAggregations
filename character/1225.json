  "description" : "Happiny are an exclusively female Pokémon that resemble Nurse Joy, with 3 round curls on their foreheads and a ponytail on top of their hair. The resemblance to Nurse Joy is probably linked to the fact its evolved forms (in the anime at least) work with Nurse Joy. Happiny like to carry egg-shaped objects in their pouches, imitating Chansey and Blissey, the Pokémon they may eventually become. This behavior is more than just play, however; a Happiny will evolve if it holds an Oval Stone upon leveling up during the daytime. In the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games, Trainers are given a Happiny Egg to hatch and care for as they tour Hearthome City, home of Sinnoh`s Contest Hall. More Happiny can be hatched if their evolved forms hold Luck Incense during the breeding process in Solaceon City.\nHappiny first appeared in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl. In the episode \"All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go\", Brock acquires an egg, which later hatches into a Happiny in \"One Big Happiny Family!\" there are rumours on internet forums saying that Happiny may evolve into Chansey and that this may bring about the end of Brock`s time on Pokemon breeding and traveling with Ash and co. If this was to happen then perhaps Max from the Hoenn series may return as the \"informer\" character having begun his own Pokemon journey. This however has no factual basis and is just a theory.",
