  "description" : "Usuzawa Sae is a third year at Miyamori Girl`s High, plays vice-captain position. She has the ability to \"mark\" an opponent by keeping her gaze on them, so that they will not be able to complete a hand. This ability though is very fatiguing and can cause her to be on the verge of collapse afterwards. She wears a monocle and it seems to have some sort of power to it, as the lens clouds over when someone is away to win with a big hand. It also seems to react to \"monster\" players as it shatters due to Miyanaga Saki`s power.\nSource: Wiki",
