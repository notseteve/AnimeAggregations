  "description" : "Alan is a Trainer who travels around to \"master Mega Evolution and stand on the top as the strongest\". Although he studied Mega Evolution with Professor Sycamore once and was the professor`s assistant, the two parted way.\nWhile traveling through a forest in Kalos region, he encountered Ayaka in a 1-on-1 Mega Evolution battle and after a fierce battle he ended up winning the fight. Watching the battle was Manon who quickly became attached to Alan as she had some questions for him to answer and soon after became his `traveling companion`.\nNurse Joy told Alan that Siebold of the Kalos Region Elite Four had a restaurant nearby, so Alan went to challenge him. When Siebold approached Alan, Alan told him that he wanted to try Zumi`s unofficial menu. The two battled in a 1-on-1 Mega Evolution battle and despite the type disadvantage, Alan held his own for most of the battle until he finally lost. Siebold was impressed with Alan as he was powerful enough to corner him even with a type disadvantage. He complemented him on an excellent battle as it had been a while since he \"last had fresh meat with a backbone\".",
