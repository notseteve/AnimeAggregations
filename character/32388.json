After her father lost control, a century before the start of the series, she was forced to become a homunculus and lead a squadron of homunculi to kill Victor showing her father her tears of what has happened to her. As a result, she came to hate alchemy, just like her father, and is depicted as having a sharp tongue and cynical attitude. She is also perceptive of others, and points out to Papillon the nature of his rejection in eating human flesh. Victoria disguises herself as a student of the Newton`s Apple All-Girl Academy, protecting the chamber that houses the multiple clones of her mother`s brain. She likes to eat \"Mama`s special\", a piece of food which is always hidden under pixelization, but which is in fact a piece of the dead brains of her mother. After hundreds of years, she is finally reunited with her father who asked her about her mother. In \"Buso Renkin Period,\" she is shown following her father to the Moon.",
