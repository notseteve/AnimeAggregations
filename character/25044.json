  "description" : "At the close of the Divine Wars, the EFF would not have much time to rest. An abnormal gravity distortion at the fifth Lagrange point would signal the appearance of the Neviim Battlestation, the central piece for a Ze-Balmary invasion force. Giving it the codename AGX-06 White Star, the EFF forces would scramble to form an attack plan against this strange new threat. At the same time, Neviim would launch countless attack forces made up not only of the Megillot, but also of more powerful humanoid machines only previously seen by mankind in the form of data contained within Meteor Three.\nThe actual size of the White Star is 40 kilometers in diameter and it effectively appears as Earth`s artificial second moon. Even after the Aerogator conflict, the White Star would remain, and prove a critical role in future wars.",
