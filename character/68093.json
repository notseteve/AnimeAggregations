  "description" : "Diantha is the strongest Pokémon Trainer in the Kalos region and is also the Champion of the Elite Four. As a famous actress, she is know for her elegant, full of mature composure and according to Serena, she is just the perfect woman in every aspect. Her character is based off of the real world actress Audrey Hepburn.\nHer movie \"My Sweet Lady\" (マイスイーツ・レディ) was the current blockbuster when Ash Ketchum was in the Kalos region. The movie title is a nod to the Audrey Hepburn movie My Fair Lady. Serena considers Diantha to be her idol. Professor Sycamore has been trying to get Diantha`s Key Stone so he can study it but she has respectfully declined his requests on numerous occasions.\nWhile doing location shooting in a region, Diantha makes sure she tries the sweets that are famous there, no matter how busy she is. When Serena got the last gâteau au chocolat slice, she decided to share it with Diantha who was in disguise. She usually declines private matches with Trainers, but since Ash Ketchum and his friends shared the cake with her, she made an exception and battled against him. The match was left undecided as it was interrupted by Rocket Gang. Ash Ketchum vowed to battle her again when he won the Kalos League.",
