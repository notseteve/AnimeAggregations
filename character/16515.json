  "description" : "Storch is an Amestrian State Military Officer stationed in Central City and the personal secretary of the Führer, http://anidb.net/ch10175 [King Bradley], until http://anidb.net/ch6587 [Lt. Riza Hawkeye] is given the position so as to allow Bradley to keep an eye on her and the other members of http://anidb.net/ch6586 [Colonel Mustang]`s team. He arrives outside Central Command to deliver Hawkeye`s new orders personally and is accompanied by Yakovlev from Internal Affairs. Storch reappears in Chapter 98, arriving outside Central Command upon hearing that Bradley has returned from his mysterious absence and directing the cadre of Central troops waiting for orders from their Führer. As Storch orders the soldiers into the compound and attempts to establish contact with any loyal soldiers within the fortress, his platoon is incapacitated and he is knocked unconscious by http://anidb.net/ch10405 [Fuu].",
