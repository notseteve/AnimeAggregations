  "description" : "The Guntank is the third variety of prototype mobile suit developed by the Earth Federation. Lacking legs and hands, this crude mobile suit is relatively immobile and can`t defend itself in close-range combat, and is thus used mostly for long-range artillery fire. The Guntank is initially manned by driver Ryu Jose and gunner Hayato Kobayashi, and is later modified so that Hayato can operate it single-handedly from the head cockpit.",
