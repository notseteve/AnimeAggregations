  "description" : "One of the Gundam mobile suits possessed by Celestial Being. Like the other Gundams, the Exia is equipped with a GN Drive, a so-called \"solar reactor\" that provides it with almost limitless energy. The GN particles generated by this drive also give the Gundams remarkable mobility and stealth capabilities, and allow them to carry powerful beam weapons. The Exia is intended mainly for close combat, and it can be equipped with seven different swords for different kinds of mission, including a huge GN Sword and two GN Blades whose cutting edges are enveloped in GN particles. Its long-range weaponry is limited to the rifle mode of the GN Sword and the small GN Vulcans installed in its forearms.",
