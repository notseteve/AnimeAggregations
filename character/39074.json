  "description" : "An Australian Aboriginal fisherman and Pankration practitioner who made his debut in the original Virtua Fighter. The most skilful fisherman of his village, he has an engaging personality. He was bested by only one opponent - the giant, eight-meter long, man-eating \"Satan Shark\". They fought several battles, and finally met in their ultimate match. Jeffry was routed and his boat wrecked, but he somehow managed to recover as he hovered on the verge of death. He entered the World Fighting Tournament with a vow to build a new boat and do battle with the shark again.\nAfter the third world tournament, Jeffry finally has some cash to build his boat. However, with the boat completed, Jeffry finds out that the \"Satan Shark\" has mysteriously disappeared. Unable to find the \"Satan Shark\", Jeffry starts asking the other fishermen the whereabouts of the \"Satan Shark\". He was then told the location of where the \"Satan Shark\" was seen last. However, even though he now had the location of the shark`s new hunting ground, he was still unable to find it. When he hears of the fourth world tournament, he decides to join in hope of winning the cash just so he can afford a sonar device to hunt for the shark.",
