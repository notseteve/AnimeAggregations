  "description" : "Yume was the leader of the second Disciplinary Squad and teamed up with Karasuba in the past.\nShe rescued Musubi when she was a child and saved her life by giving her her \"Tama\", the core which gives the Sekirei life and use their powers.\nYume bears an uncanny resemblance to Musubi as seen in Karasuba`s memories.\nYume refers to herself as the \"Sekirei of Fate\" and is a \"Defender of Love\".\nYume possessed light-based powers used in conjunction with her super strength and hand-to-hand combat.\nWhen Musubi lost her Sekirei crest fighting Benitsubasa, Yume`s soul temporarily took control of her body, defeated the Disciplinary Squad and was able to restore Musubi`s crest.\nShe asked Minato to \"teach love to these little birds\" (a reference to the Sekirei), and said that she was awakened by Minato`s warm and gentle spirit.\nHer name literally means \"Dream\". Yume`s Sekirei crest is unique, as it does not appear on her back, rather it appears on her exposed torso with her number on it.",
