  "description" : "Appryu is a dual-type Grass/Dragon Pokémon introduced in Generation VIII.\nIt evolves from Kajicchu when exposed to a Tart Apple. It is one of Kajicchu`s final forms, the other being Tarupple. It also has a Kyodaimax form.\nAppryu is a green worm-like dragon Pokémon with a light green underside and yellow eyes. It uses parts of an apple to form its body. It has one part on the top of its head with a single horn sticking out, one on the bottom attached to its tail, and two parts as wings attached to two limbs with three-claw hands.\nIts cheeks store acid strong enough to induce chemical burns, which it can spit at its targets. It can disguise itself as an apple by folding its apple peels.\nWhen exposed to Kyodaimax energy, Appryu can produce significantly more sweet nectar. An intensely sweet aroma of nectar pours out when it stretches its neck, and this aroma is so sweet it can cause other Pokémon to faint by merely sniffing the scent.\nAppryu is the only known Pokémon capable of using G-Force and the exclusive Kyodai Move Kyodai Acid Attack.",
