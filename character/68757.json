  "description" : "Maple lives in a house in the Must Mountains with her Kucheat. She often goes around collecting flowers in the meadows. Korrina was instructed by her grandpa Gurkinn to meet with Maple as she could help her with Lucario`s Mega Evolution issue.\nShe instructed them to arrange flowers and then go out to collect them, day after day until they realized that working together, they`d link their hearts even stronger. By admiring views and arranging flowers, Maple believed it to be the most effective practice they could get. By having one heart and two views, they could tie the two views together and turn them into strength.",
