  "description" : "Phil is the Crown Prince of Seyruun, and presumably the only one trusted to take the throne after numerous assassination attempts. Phil, like his daughter, is dominated by his thirst for justice, so much that he has dedicated his life to being a pacifist. Or at least that`s what he says, he acts more like a pro wrestler sometimes.\nUnlike most of the Seyruun royal family, Phil has no magical powers, but he does have a lot of brute strength. He uses this mostly in the form of oxymoronic, justice-themed physical attacks, such as \"Pacifist Crush\", \"Kindness to All Creatures Kick\", \"Benevolent Giant Swing\", and \"Goodwill Towards Man Smash\". His sheer brute strength is even enough to destroy lesser demons.",
