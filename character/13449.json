  "description" : "As founder and commander of the http://anidb.net/ch25714 [AMP], Rally is highly concerned with the well being of the officers under her command. She is very business-like in all her dealings, both with her own officers and with other police officials.\nHer private life is a total mystery. Rally seems to have significant financial resources.\nRally has a younger sister by the name of http://anidb.net/ch25720 [Rosa]. Both siblings are half-http://anidb.net/ch25718 [Lucifer Hawk] which gives them great magical powers, though they are rarely shown. During their childhood they experienced persecution of the `devil`s children`; as a result, the older sibling is often reluctant to use her powers whereas Rosa decided to belong to http://anidb.net/ch25784 [Nemesis], siding with the Lucifer Hawks.\nTheir parents are most likely dead. http://anidb.net/ch25787 [Lufa Cheyenne] may well have been her mother; in the manga she tells her fellow AMP people that her father (who is never visible in the anime) was from the Lucifer Hawk.",
