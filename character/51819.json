  "description" : "Akane is a quiet girl in the same class as Kouhei. She meets him on a rainy day, standing by herself in an empty lot. Her childhood friend she fell in love with, Tsukasa, disappeared into the Eternal World in the same lot. Ever since, she continues waiting in that empty lot on rainy days, holding a pink umbrella, waiting for him to return. She enjoys cooking and making her own boxed lunches. She does not really open her heart up to those around her, and any time Kouhei tries to do something for her, she replies, \"no\". The sole person she can talk normally with is Shiiko. She has sweet tooth and wears her long hair in braids.\nSource: Wikipedia",
