  "description" : "Also a Specter only present in Lost Canvas, Heavenly Penetrating Star, Nasu Veronica is one of the most potent Specters alongside Bennu Kagaho, and also the most monstrous ever appeared. The one behind the hideous illusions and creatures that roamed the forest in which Tenma, Yato and Yuzuriha had entered, he was introduced as an androgynous nun reciting Psalm 23 in a church. He is able to spit countless, destructive flies, call forth the dead and create insects and slimes of enormous proportions. With Burial Fort Veronica can summon massive amounts of a jelly-like, exceptionally caustic substance, that he uses to melt anything on his path. Veronica`s soul is destroyed by Cancer Manigoldo. He is able to launch one last assault however, as Thanatos uses his decaying body to channel part of his power and attack Manigoldo.",
