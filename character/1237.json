  "description" : "Skorupi, classified as the \"Ogre Scorp\" Pok√©mon, grows much larger and more dangerous with its evolution. Drapion`s resemblance to the scorpion hasn`t been much increased, as it still has only four legs and two arms. These arms are mounted on the sides of its head, which has a full 360-degree field of view. This gives Drapion a much large range of attack. Drapion is only weak to Ground Type Pokemon. Aaron of Sinnoh`s Elite Four has a Drapion.",
