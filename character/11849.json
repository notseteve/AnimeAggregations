  "description" : "A veteran police detective based from the Jounan Police Precient, he is partnered up with Hata in investigating the mysterious attacks against Schaft-made Labors. He has a leg injury sustained before the case and uses a crutch, which hampers his physical abilities in conducting his investigation. He is known not to be a versatile user of modern technology (e.g. using Music CDs) and prefers to use analog records for his entertainment or let Hata do the computer work. It`s not known what happened to his family, but it`s assumed that he had been estranged from them for a long time.",
