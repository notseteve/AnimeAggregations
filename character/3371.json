  "description" : "I-Pin is a 5-year-old assassin from Hong Kong. She is regularly transformed into her 15-year-old self by way of Lambo`s Ten Year Bazooka. The 15-year-old \"Adult I-Pin\" is now fluent in Japanese, and despite the fact that she is one of the most promising young assassins, she works part-time at a Chinese Restaurant ten years later in order to earn money for college tuition, though she still retains her skills. I-Pin`s main ability is the usage of Gyoza-Ken, which combines her martial arts abilities with special gyoza buns laced with the scent of garlic, the latter of which numbs the brain and forces the muscles to involuntarily move on their own. Her most destructive ability is the \"Pinzu-Timed Super Explosion\", activated whenever I-Pin expresses extreme shyness. Pin-numbers (such as those used in mah jong) appear on her forehead, counting down until it turns her into a human bomb that can create a small crater with its destruction. Due to her near-sightedness, she sees Lambo as the broccoli monster, and often beats him up. She also has a crush on Kyoya Hibari, who looks like her master, and often activates her Pinzu-Timed Super Explosion after seeing him.",
