  "description" : "The Gamia Sisters are three identical young women who are vicious and formidable martial artists who are sent by Ashura to assassinate Kouji so that his robot can`t stop their next attack. Apart from their agility and strength in hand-to-hand combat, they can use their hair as a cutting weapon. They are commonly referred to as Ashura`s daughters, but given their mechanical construction it is likely that they are either cyborgs or androids.",
