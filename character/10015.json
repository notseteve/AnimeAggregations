  "description" : "Arashi is a student of Yazagaku with a taste for punk style, piercings, and alternative music. He is Miwako`s boyfriend, they have both known each other--along with Hiroyuki Tokumori--from childhood. Miwako later reveals that she \"chose\" Arashi over Hiroyuki when the three of them began high school. Even though Arashi has a generally cynical, sometimes abrasive personality, he does care deeply about those around him. When the members of ParaKiss engage in outrageous behavior, Arashi is usually the voice of reason. He is the son of a musician, Kanzaki Risa, who is a good friend of Mikako Kouda.",
