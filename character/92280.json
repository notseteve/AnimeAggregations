  "description" : "Golem Keter Malkuth is http://anidb.net/ch88739 [Caster of Black]`s Noble Phantasm, a golem that he could not complete during his lifetime. Unlike regular Noble Phantasms that can be called \"complete existences\", it was recorded in history despite being incomplete.\nCaster of Black`s wish in participating in the Holy Grail War was its completion, but simply constructing it wasn`t enough. He wished to reproduce God`s miracle in the creation of life, bringing forth a copy of the Primordial Human, Adam, so simply creating a golem of unparalleled power would not allow it to become a perfect existence.\nFor his golem to work, he needed a functional core to supply the magical energy needed to sustain it. He initially wanted to use http://anidb.net/ch88726 [Sieg] as a core, due to his exceptional Magic Circuits, but in the end he used http://anidb.net/ch89998 [his Master] instead.\nAfter the Caster of Black was gravely wounded by the http://anidb.net/ch88736 [Archer of Black], he fused himself with his golem and assumed control.\nSource: TYPE-MOON Wiki",
