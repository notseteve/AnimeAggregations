  "description" : "Ledo is a Second Lieutenant in the Galactic Alliance of Humankind. His combat skills are great, but he grew up knowing nothing other than war. As a result, he`s not very good at expressing his emotions, and often misunderstood. During combat he`s swallowed by a rift in space-time and castaway to the remote planet, Earth, where he`s rescued from cold sleep by Gargantia. In the midst of an unknown environment and a language he doesn`t understand, he starts communicating with the people of Gargantia in order to survive, and slowly he begins to have a change of heart. He`s 16.\nSource: ANN",
