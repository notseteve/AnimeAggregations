  "description" : "Shinichi is Samatarou`s and Tenko`s friend at school. He`s quite girl-crazy and frequently peppers his speech with English phrases when he becomes excited - which he often does, especially when talking about girls. His friends consider him something of an idiot, sadly not without reason, but he seems to be essentially good-natured.",
