  "description" : "Elesa`s Zebstrika is a very powerful, fast and strong Pokémon and it proved this during the gym battle against Bianca`s Minccino, Bianca`s Pignite and Bianca`s Shelmet by defeating all of them. It didn`t seem to even battle with much effort as it swiftly defeated all of Bianca`s Pokémon.\nBattle against Ash`s Palpitoad\nElesa`s Zebstrika was also used in her Gym battle against Ash`s Palpitoad. Due to Palpitoad being part Ground-type, Zebstrika was unable to use its strongest attack, Wild Charge. After dodging Palpitoad`s Mud Shot, Elesa ordered her Zebstrika to repeatedly use Flame Charge, even though it was ineffective against Ash`s Palpitoad, a part Water-type Pokémon, in order to boost its speed, and thus, it was able to dodge Palpitoad`s Hydro Pump attack. Zebstrika`s Double Kick attacks that followed made Palpitoad dizzy, and in an attempt to finish the battle, Elesa ordered Zebstrika to use Quick Attack. However, Ash`s Palpitoad endured the attack and managed to beat Elesa`s Zebstrika using a combination of its Supersonic, Hydro Pump and Mud Shot attacks.",
