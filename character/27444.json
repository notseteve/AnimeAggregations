  "description" : "Golurk, known as the Automaton Pokémon, is the evolution of Golett. It is based on a clay golem supposedly created by an ancient civilization to protect people and Pokémon. It seems to look like a suit of armour possessed by a ghost. There is a slanting crack on the chest part of the armour, which is sealed by an object much similar to a band-aid. If this seal is broken, its indefinite energy will go out of control, and it will keep flying without having control on itself. It has a crystal-like formation on its shoulders. Its suit resembles a Roman armour. Despite its large size, Golurk is capable of flying. By inserting its hands in its arms and inserting its legs and feet in its body, it can blast off like a rocket.",
