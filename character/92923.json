  "description" : "A free spirit who doesn`t know fear, Azuki is the eldest of the Minaduki catgirls. Azuki never hides her true nature. She isn`t afraid to speak her mind, often with a few uncouth words. Most tasks are a nuisance to her at best, leaving her with little motivation to do them. She is actually quite capable, though, and can do almost anything if put to work (aside from physical labor, anyway). She has a complex about her body type, howeverâ€”never, ever mention short legs around her.",
