  "description" : "Hina is the youngest member of the Seven Shadows. During the third day of the Shadowverse World Ranking, Hina meets Ren and makes her take her to the toy store. There the two come into conflict over their opposing tastes in heroes and villains, so they decide to settle it with a Shadowverse battle.\nHina uses a Forestcraft deck. Her deck relies on insect-based followers, most gaining buffs from the Fertile Forest amulet, mainly increasing their numbers to overwhelm the opponent. Her strategy also focuses on playing as many Insect Larvas as possible. Her ace card appears to be Butterfly Queen.\nSource: Shadowverse Wikia",
