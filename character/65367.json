  "description" : "Old Man`s Delphox seems to be the Old Man`s main Pokémon. The Old Man won the tournament at the Village Festival near Shoyo City.\nWanting to knock her husbands down a peg and to get him to apologize for the fight they had the day before, she agreed to battle Old Man`s Delphox with her secret weapon, Clemont`s Chespin in a Pokémon battle. The old man agreed but with the stipulation that she would forgive him for what he said the day before. Clemont`s Chespin was too fat to battle though as it had been eating too many macarons. Clemont ended up intervening and got it to roll to reduce its belly fat. The match had to be called as the old man`s back gave out as he was trying to command Mafoxy to use Mystical Fire.",
