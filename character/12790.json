  "description" : "Making his home a lonely shack up in the mountain forests, Nekota is http://anidb.net/ch61 [Kamogawa]`s best friend of over fifty years. Occasionally, http://anidb.net/ch61 [Kamogawa] will visit him in the mountains, once taking http://anidb.net/ch23 [Ippo] and the others there to train for upcoming fights. While a meddling old geezer who tends to overstay his welcome, he is nonetheless loyal, good-hearted and trustworthy to the boys at the http://anidb.net/ch12521 [Kamogawa Gym]. Nekota proved a far greater technical boxer than even http://anidb.net/ch61 [Kamogawa]; but as a result of their constant spars, he developed the beginning stages of punch-drunk syndrome. Despite this condition, Nekota took it upon himself to challenge an arrogant American military officer, Ralph Anderson, in a boxing match to boost Japanese morale. Though Nekota had the upper hand, Anderson won by throwing an illegal rabbit punch, which resulted in permanent mid-brain damage.",
