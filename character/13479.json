Like Mr. Bushido, Revive holds a special license that allows him to act independently. However he agrees to follow Kati Mannequin`s battle strategies.\nLater Revive allows himself to be captured by Celestial Being in order to steal the 00 Gundam and 0 Raiser with Anew`s aid, but the attempt is thwarted. Revive is killed by Lyle Dylandy during the climatic battle at the end of the second series when the Cherudim Gundam targets the Gadessa`s cockpit. ",
