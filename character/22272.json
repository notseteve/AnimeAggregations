  "description" : "The Minerva is the first new ZAFT warship constructed since the previous war. Designed for use with Second Stage series mobile suits, it is equipped with a deuterion beam transmitter that can instantly recharge these machines, as well as a complex system of hangars and catapults for launching the components of the Impulse Gundam. The Minerva is also a formidable warship in its own right thanks to its powerful weapons, high speed, and ability to enter the atmosphere and operate on Earth. Due to an attack on Armory One the day before its scheduled launching ceremony, the Minerva and its inexperienced crew soon find themselves on the front lines of a new conflict.",
