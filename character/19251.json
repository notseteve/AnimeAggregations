  "description" : "Vidaldus Taka is a mage who is part of Trinity Raven, a group working under Jellal that belong to the assassins guild called the Death`s Head Caucus. Vidaldus` appearance is that of a rock star who always seems to be swinging his hair around wildly. He ran into Lucy Heartfilia and Juvia Loxar as they were searching for Natsu Dragneel. Lucy hid while Juvia was unaffected by his attacks. However, her attacks didn`t work on him either as his hair can soak up water. He then used his Rock of Succubus magic to take control of Juvia and attacked Lucy. Lucy was at a disadvantage for most of the fight but Juvia managed to talk to Lucy subconsciously through the water. Together with Lucy`s Celestial Spirit Aquarius they used an attack called Unison Raid against Vidaldus knocking him out, as well as wiping all of the hair clean off of his head.",
