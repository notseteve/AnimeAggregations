  "description" : "Gekidrago is the featured villain of episodes 6 through 11. Large and muscular, he is described in one of the episodes as having a head like a moai (the statues from Easter Island). He relies on his brawn rather than his brain. Easily having the highest fortitude of the group, Gekidrago can take a direct, unprotected hit from a Marble Screw and only be knocked out for a few minutes. He often ends his sentences with \"-Muka\".",
