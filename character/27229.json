Along with his classmates, Hirota befriended a Yabukuron and brought it to class. Yuri said the class couldn`t keep it and her point was made when it released a bad smell. Yuri took the Yabukuron to the junkyard despite Hirota`s affection towards it.\nSatoshi became friends with Hirota even though he threw mudballs at him when they first met on the road. Satoshi helped sort out the disagreement regarding the Yabukuron and the class was able to keep it.",
