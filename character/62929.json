  "description" : "Tony`s Father lives with his wife and his son Tony on an island in the Decolora archipelago. He works in the mountains at an observatory.\nHis wife was upset because her son Tony was missing. Officer Jenny said there had been reports that a Pok√©mon uncommon in the area was walking with a boy looking like Tony on its back. Tony`s Mother explained that he might have gone to the observatory as her husband works there and it`s his birthday. She continued by saying Tony was excited to celebrate it with him and even prepared a present but her husband had to stay overnight at the observatory and couldn`t come home. Officer Jenny instructed Tony`s Mother to stay at home in case he returned there.\nUpon safely arriving at the mountain observatory, thanks to Ash and his friends, Tony`s Father was glad to see his son but told him that was very reckless of him to try to come to visit him on his own.",
