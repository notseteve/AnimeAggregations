  "description" : "A sorcerer from Necessarius. His sorcery name is Fortis931. He is an extremely heavy smoker; he claims a world without nicotine would be hell. He specializes in using flames and is able to use a flame sword or summon a 3000 degree Celsius fire called Innocentius to battle his enemies. Despite his looks, he is actually fourteen years old and is physically weak. He has a short temper but is actually kind, as he cares about Index very much and his failure to save her life without losing her memories was his greatest regret.",
