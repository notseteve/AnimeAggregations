  "description" : "The Beings of the Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race, more commonly known by the acronym BETA are a fictional extraterrestrial lifeform in the Muv-Luv universe and the primary antagonistic faction against humanity`s forces.\nThe BETA invaded Earth in 1973 after arriving on the Moon in 1967 and being spotted on Mars in 1958. By 2001, the world population is down to 1 billion people. When they first arrived in Japan in 1998, 36 million people were dead within a week. They vary greatly in size, the smallest identified strains (soldier-class) being around three metres tall, and the largest identified strains (fort-class) at over sixty metres tall. They cannot fly, and so shoot down anything that does, rendering aircraft useless and making evacuation a lot more difficult.\nTheir very existence is shrouded in mystery. All that mankind knows of them is that they are hostile, are carbon-based lifeforms, and don`t consider humans to be living beings.",
