  "description" : "As Nagi goes on a rampage on all the guards, Ganta stands to protect Shiro, taking all of his punches and trying to reason with him. As Nagi starts to come to his senses thanks to the bell Karako wears reminding him of his friends, Karako is suddenly stabbed by Genkaku. Nagi stands to protect his friends but is shot by Genkaku, who begins killing the other guards, while Ganta starts being poisoned due to not having any Candy in a while. Hibana tries to escape but is killed by Toto, who had managed to obtain Crow`s abilities after drinking his blood. As Shiro enters Wretched Egg mode, the stone in Ganta`s chest glows and blasts a powerful shot, with Nagi holding Genkaku in place as they are both taken out. Before passing on, Nagi gives Ganta his last piece of Candy. As Karako and some others escape, Ganta decides to stay behind so he can protect his friends.",
