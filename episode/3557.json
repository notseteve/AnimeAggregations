  "description" : "Sakura had to deal with some more odd things- this time, it was a bunch of snowmen. There were a lot of strange things happening, and Sakura really wanted to get to the bottom of it, so she decided to use the Return card to go back and talk to Clow Reed himself. She told me about her conversation with him; it seemed very... cryptic. But Sakura really cares about Kero, Yue and the cards, so everything would definitely be alright! After she got back, we finally discovered the new Clow Reed!\nSource: crunchyroll",
