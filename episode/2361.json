  "description" : "A new boy has joined our class! His name is Xiaolang Li, and he`s from Hong Kong. We also found out that he wants to collect the Clow Cards, too! On the way home from school that day, Sakura stumbled across the Thunder card. She got the impression that there was some connection between this and Xiaolang`s presence, so she asked Kero about it. He explained that Clow Reed was a magician, and created the Clow Book. He also revealed that Xiaolang is a relative of Clow Reed`s on his mother`s side. And as it happened, Xiaolang`s amazing knowledge of the Clow Cards helped Sakura seal Thunder away. At the same time, though, Xiaolang was overly dismissive of Sakura`s ability, claiming that her magic is too weak to capture all the cards on her own.\nSource: crunchyroll",
