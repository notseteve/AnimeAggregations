  "description" : "Suzune and Kagami`s students are worried about his disappearance despite Hiiragi`s assurances, and it seems that Hiiragi knows something about it, they trail her in a taxi as she goes to the KMC laboratory to pick up Reiko, and are perplexed when her car suddenly disappears without a trace as it enters the secret tunnel.\nAt the KMC laboratory meanwhile, Reiko has hacked into the security systems and locked everyone else out of the laboratory as she does not want to go back to school if Kagami will remain at KMC. Kagami counter-hacks into the network and manages to enter the facility, where he speaks to Reiko and convinces her to open everything. The two of them return to Icho Academy, after Kagami realises what his true role as a teacher should be, although he warns Hiiragi that it may mean that he may make the whole idea of school obsolete.\nKagami later distributes a smartphone application to all of his students that enables them to reliably predict what questions will appear in upcoming tests. He says that this is intended to free them to pursue what interests them without worrying about grades for things that they have no use for.",
