  "description" : "Luckily, Fuurin was able to pull ahead with three runs in the first inning of their first regional preliminaries game. However, Itsuki`s Yokouchi begins to mix in sliders that he had kept hidden up his sleeve until then, causing one batter after the other to strike out. Mutsuko combines accuracy and breaking balls to keep the Itsuki batters under control as well. Daigo prepares for a low score, close quarter game, and worries that the Fuurin defense might start to crack. Shortly after that, the 3rd-year Tanba on first base makes an unbelievable mistake.\nSource: crunchyroll",
