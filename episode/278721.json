  "description" : "The entrance ceremony has ended, and club recruitment of the freshmen has begun. Amidst the competitive recruitment frenzy, the Robot Research Club and Motorcycle Club were getting in a heated stare off over a freshman that both clubs were aiming to recruit. Kasumi, from the Disciplinary Committee, and Shippou, from the Extracurricular Activities Federation, intervene. However, now the two who had come to break up the fight begin arguing amongst themselves over who should have authority over the situation, and were on the brink of initiating a physical fight. Meanwhile, Koichi, the head of the Saegusa Family, was devising a plan to mitigate the Yotsuba Family`s power through a false anti-magician campaign that the USNA`s Humanist Extremist group was drawing up for the media.\nSource: crunchyroll",
