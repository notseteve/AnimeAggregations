  "description" : "When Yoko fights a tough battle against monsters, En-o Shoryu, comes to save her.  He tells Yoko that only Kei’s queen can use the sword Yoko has been using, and that shocks Yoko.  Yoko doesn’t like it when Rakushun starts treating her differently, so they bond as friends.  Naotaka and Rokuta (Enki) tell Yoko Kei Kingdom’s status where a fake queen, Joei, controls Keiki.  Yoko also learns the relationship between a kingdom, king and Kirin.  She cannot accept that she is a queen but Keiki needs to be saved. Shoryu gives her one day to think it over.\nSource: crunchyroll",
