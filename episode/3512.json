  "description" : "Sakura tried to seal the Dash card, but it escaped into someone`s yard, and some lady said the battle costume I made for Sakura looked strange. Anyway, the girl who lives there, Rei Tachibana, took Dash in and bandaged its wounds. The next day, Rei, who was struggling with the 100-meter dash, began to set personal best times thanks to Dash`s influence. I went with Sakura and Kero to Rei`s house to try to get closer to Dash, but after talking to Rei, and hearing how hard she was trainignf or a big track meet, Sakura changed her mind about sealing Dash away. Two days before the big track meet, Xiaolang noticed Dash`s presence, which forced Sakura to seal the Dash card away, and left Rei frantically searching for Dash in the park near her house. Feeling bad for Rei, Xiaolang called upon Dash to show itself to Rei right before the 100-meter dash final, which cheered her up enough to win on her own!\nSource: crunchyroll",
