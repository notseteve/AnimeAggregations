  "description" : "The Gintama anime has finally reached the middle of its third year on the air. Shinpachi explains the purpose of this episode and aims to look back on all their past adventures and build up new enthusiasm and nostalgia. Upon hearing that the final chapter is not the final episode and that the series will continue for another six months, Gintoki and Kagura lose all enthusiasm. Then the ending credits and preview plays. Is this episode really over after only six minutes?\nSource: crunchyroll",
