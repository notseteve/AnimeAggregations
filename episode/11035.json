  "description" : "The planet of Namek was destroyed years before, a New Namek having since been located and settled. During the intervening period, the inhabitants have enjoyed a time of peace. But as death approaches and threatens homeland horizons, Goku and the Z Warriors are called upon to save a world not their own. More surprising than one planet which can devour another is the enemy`s true face behind the evil enterprise. But just as seeing is believing, Goku and the others settle in to fight the once-defeated Cooler and his forces. And yet victory won`t be so easy the second time around! As the Z Warriors are vanquished one after the other, the fate of New Namek hangs in the balance?\nSource: crunchyroll",
