  "description" : "At Kissho Academy`s annual festival, Fuyuki tries giving a presentation on paranormal powers, but is heckled mercilessly by two self-styled \"Occult Busters.\" Then, Natsumi`s in a bind when many of the actors and stagehands for her class`s production of Romeo and Juliet come down with food poisoning. When Giroro learns that Natsumi herself is playing one of the leads, he agonizes over whether he should step in and take the romantic co-starring role.\nSource: crunchyroll",
