  "description" : "Shachi is believed to have already died fighting Kaioh to protect Leia. But the female visages in the Holy Temple of Asura create a mysterious resonance, and with tears in his eyes, Shachi rises again. Even as heavily overwhelmed as he had been, he launches a counterattack so ferocious that it even shocks Kaioh. It all comes from the power of love... Kaioh, now convinced that the main family`s ultimate technique is love, seeks to prove the superiority of the North Star Lapis Lazuli Fist that he uses for his evil ultimate art.\nSource: crunchyroll",
