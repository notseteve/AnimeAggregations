  "description" : "On day two of the Rookie Events, Airi lives up to her nickname Éclair(lightning) by using lightning-fast movement spells to dominate the Cloudball competition. Shiori is back in full force and crushes her opponent in Ice Pillars Break. While Third High steadily closes the gap with First High in wins, Miyuki makes her debut in the Ice Pilllars Break tournament. The audience and the rival schools are blown away by her mind-boggling magical powers. Even Eimi is overwhelmed by Miyuki’s powers, but she must prepare to face Shiori in her next Ice Pillars Break match.\nSource: Funimation",
