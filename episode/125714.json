  "description" : "The fight between Lag and Noir continues, and Zazie comes back to help after sending Wasiolka to report. Just then a ton of swarming type gaichuu, Lao-Lao, come to attack. Lag and Zazie do their best to fight the gaichuu, but the huge numbers and lack of dingos to back them up makes it a tough battle. But then a trusty ally appears, and finally it`s time for Lag to shoot that Letter Bullet!\nSource: crunchyroll",
