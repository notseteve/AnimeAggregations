  "description" : "Masayuki is suspected of killing his ex-wife when the police find her dead. There was a message written in blood on her hand that put Masayuki at a great disadvantage. The only one who can vouch for his innocence with an alibi was Yuki-Onna, who was with him at the time of the murder. But there`s no way he can let a yokai provide a statement for him. Yuki-Onna asks Kotoko for help to track down the real killer.\nSource: crunchyroll",
