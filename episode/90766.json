  "description" : "One of the school prefects, Yui Kotegawa, is all about rules, discipline, and good morality.  She feels that things have gotten quite out of hand and will not tolerate anymore lewd behavior.  Yui convinces the principal to allow her to set some rules for moral behavior at school and creates an enforcement squad.  Rito comes under Yui’s special attention, as she suspects that he is the one behind the corruption of good and decent values.  As punishment, Rito is banned from speaking to any girl for two weeks!  With Lala and Ren causing all kinds of havoc, it seems almost impossible that Rito will be able to stay in line.\nSource: crunchyroll",
