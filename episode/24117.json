  "description" : "Triton gives up going to the Atlantic Ocean for the time being to rescue Pipi and Fin, and goes back to the Pacific Ocean. There waits a white whale that has been brought back to life by Leharl. Fortunately, Triton gets some unexpected help during his battle with the white whale from Laurence, who is proud of having killed a white whale once, and his son Guilty, who is proud of his father. The father and son challenge the revived white whale again to prove their story, because people in their village had not believed it before.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
