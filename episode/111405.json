  "description" : "Shizuku asks Male Natsuru to go out on a date with her. While Shizuku is generally insistent that it`s a proper date, Natsuru just goes along with it thinking it is a plan to draw out the White Kämpfer. After visiting an aquarium and having a picnic, Shizuku questions Natsuru about why he likes Kaede. Hesitating to ask if he suspects a connection between Kaede and the Moderators, she then talks about the Kämpfer battle, remembering a lost ally. Natsuru has a quick nap with a curious dream, only to wake up on Shizuku`s lap, curious as to whether she tried anything while he was asleep. At the end of the date, Mikoto spots them, and is not too happy about Natsuru going a date with Shizuku, not helped by Shizuku`s honest comments. Akane then comes around his house having heard from Mikoto and asks him what type of girls, beside Kaede, he would like. When Natsuru casually mentions `someone like Akane`, she transforms and gets him to make an oath and go on a date with her. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
