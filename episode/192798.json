  "description" : "The third style in the finals is the Viennese Waltz, where the male and female dancers take turns leading, which is perfect for Team Fujita. The fourth style is the elegant Slow Foxtrot, which favors Team Kugimiya. One team just started dancing whereas the other has ten years of experience. Either pair could win. The last event is the Quickstep. How will Tatara and Chinatsu do in the final round?\nSource: amazon",
