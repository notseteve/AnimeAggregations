  "description" : "The chief of the Cheyenne Fish, Navarro, gives chase to Water Press who had forced the 999 to take his people on board. He chases them in an old-fashioned space shuttle in order to continue to the fight. The Administration sends out an armored car to rescue the 999 after receiving a distress signal. But, with Tetsuro and Maetel as hostages, there is nothing they can do. Plus, they allow Navarro to enter the train after flying up in the old-fashioned shuttle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
