  "description" : "Bertholdt`s Colossal Titan turns Shiganshina into a sea of flames. Frozen by indecision, Armin hands over command to Jean, as he is good at analyzing situations quickly. Outside the Wall, the Beast Titan pitches a barrage of rocks toward the Scouts protecting the horses, stoning them and causing casualties. Eren tries to stop the Colossal Titan but is knocked unconscious. The situation looks hopeless until Erwin reveals his last ploy: a suicidal counterattack wherein he and the Scouts will serve as a diversion so Levi can kill the Beast Titan. Knowing that he is leading himself and the young Scouts to their deaths, Erwin shares an emotional farewell with Levi and gives a rousing speech to the recruits, telling them that it is better to die fighting rather than cower to the cruelty of this world, and that their lives and deaths are meaningful. He then leads the charge toward the Beast Titan through a hail of rocks.",
