  "description" : "The stakes are high with the match against Team V. In the first half, Team Z is overwhelmed by Team V`s super trio, Nagi Seishiro, Mikage Reo, and Tsurugi Zantetsu. Especially the formidable attack of Nagi and Reo pair, who have only started playing soccer six months ago with no record of losing, is enough to break their spirits. When everyone is about to give up, Bachira Meguru`s play sets fire on the ego in their hearts. In the last match of the first selection, under an extreme circumstance, the awakening of the diamonds in the rough, just as Ego wanted, has begun.\nSource: crunchyroll",
