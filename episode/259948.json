  "description" : "The first selection is the round-robin tournament of five teams of V, W, X, Y and Z in Building Five, with only top two teams being eligible to move forward. Isagi`s Team Z, the lowest ranking team, plays against Team X. But because of the special rule that allows the top scorer of the team to proceed to the next section, the match turns into chaotic scrambling for the ball, regardless of the teams. It was Barou Shoei, Team X`s formidable striker, who changes the flow of the game.\nSource: crunchyroll",
