  "description" : "Ryuko and Satsuki arrive at the original Life Fiber to battle Ragyo, who wields her own set of blades that prove resilient to their weapons. As the original Life Fiber attacks the ship, the Elite Four don new Goku Uniforms to assist Mako. During the battle, Ragyo bisects Ryuko, but this is revealed to be a plan laid out by Ryuko, who has Satsuki distract Ragyo while she heals in the ocean and targets the Life Fiber. Mako uses her sheer willpower, along with the support of the other Honnouji students, to launch the Naked Sol like a giant dagger to split through the original Life Fiber. Spurred on by their arrival, Ryuko manages to cut through the core of the Life Fiber and send it crashing down. As Nui finishes preparations for Ragyo`s ultimate Kamui, Shinra-Koketsu, absorbing Rei to power it up, Ryuko and the others prepare to end their duel with Ragyo once and for all.",
