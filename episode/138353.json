  "description" : "Natsu, Lucy, and Wendy keep watch over a gold-carrying train, which is hijacked by a trio of large-buttocked thieves called the Jiggle Butt Gang. The three use Natsu`s motion sickness to their advantage to get rid of Lucy, Happy, and Carla, leaving Wendy the only one able to defend the train`s cargo. She manages to impress them with her powers and tries to talk them out of their thieving ways, but once the train stops and Natsu recovers, Natsu sends them flying before she has a chance.",
