  "description" : "Mei undergoes strict instruction from a geisha named Otoyakko to become a proper lady worthy of being Ougai`s fiancée. She struggles desperately to learn how to wear a kimono, how to carry herself, and etiquette. Otoyakko observes Mei and tells her that, \"I don`t mind women like you.\" As Mei`s training continues, she fails to take notice of when Otoyakko slips and speaks in a more manly tone, revealing that her geisha mentor may not be all \"she\" appears to be.\nSource: crunchyroll",
