Haruko is depressed, but tries hard to restore the memories Misuzu lost. Soon, however, Misuzu`s birth father shows up, and tries to claim Misuzu back from Haruko, deciding to let Misuzu decide who she wants to live with. Haruko, desperate because of Misuzu`s memory loss, begs him to let her have Misuzu for 3 more days, to which he agrees.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
