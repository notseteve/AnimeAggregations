  "description" : "As Toriko confronts the Battle Wolf, the crowd is shocked to discover Toriko`s appearance. Mansam discovers that Toriko entered the arena through the glass walls. Meanwhile, Tina discovers Komatsu and Mansam while filming the fight. Toriko frightens the other beasts away. The Battle Wolf collapses from exhaustion, but Toriko continues to fight the beasts. Mansem orders Rin to shut down the Battle Fragrance machine, but it continues to pour out Battle Fragrance as the machine malfunctions. Toriko manages to defeat a beast with his 5-Fold Spiked Punch technique, destroying most of the dome. Toriko announces the arrival of a new Battle Wolf. Meanwhile, Rin tries to tranquil a Demon Devil Python, but she is chased by the beast. Mansem tells Komatsu that the Battle Wolf has the Gourmet Cells, which can produce a clone of a beast. Rin leads the Demon Devil Python to the arena, where Toriko confronts the beast. Mansem confronts Dohem, whose true form is Bei. Bei defeats Mansem, while the Battle Wolf easily defeats the Demon Devil Python. Toriko then confronts Bei, who tells him that he will not be interested in eating a Battle Wolf and incapacitates the Battle Wolf with a single blast from the GT Robot.\nSource: Wikipedia",
