  "description" : "With the wounded Niche left in the \"Garden of Spirits\" which the Maka protects, Lag runs into Zazie on his way back to the Bee Hive, and they stop by the town of Lament where Connor is. There, the two of them are surprised to find Connor collapsed, but it was because he`d eaten too many cookies from a nun named Sunny. Lag witnesses Roda, Noir`s dingo, picking up a delivery of letters at the Abbey where Sunny lives, so he goes undercover and infiltrates the Abbey to find out if it is a Reverse base.\nSource: crunchyroll",
