  "description" : "Raido spent middle-school isolated due to his unintentionally unfriendly appearance, and hopes that high school will be different. He decides the first step to being more social will be to get to know Aharen Reina, the girl who sits next to him. She seems distant at first, then a little too close, and before long Raido comes to understand that Aharen has more than a little trouble at gauging the distance between herself and others--in more ways than one.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
