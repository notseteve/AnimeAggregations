  "description" : "Without thinking too much of it, Mana downloads a curse app and inputs the name of a classmate. The person she cursed suffers a slight injury and a creepy notification from the app appears on Mana`s phone saying that if she doesn`t input another name within three hours, the curse will return. The curse app spreads quickly among people, and soon Mana receives notification that she`s been cursed. As the curses on the people in the city increase, hair begins to grow from the cracks in Mana`s cell phone case... Will Mana be able to break the chain of curses?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
