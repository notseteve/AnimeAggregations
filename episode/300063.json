  "description" : "The ancient magic tool the Starweaving Mira that is used at the “Magical Offering” during the Bell-Ringing Festival in Corlapton is stolen. The Starweaving Mira is an ancient magic tool that absorbs and liberates the mana of the land. It is a cursed item that is said to have its own mind and will kill the owner if it’s a male. The “Magical Offering” cannot take place without the Starweaving Mira. Monica doesn’t want the Bell-Ringing Festival that sends off the dead to be canceled, so she goes in search of the ancient magic tool. Thus beginning Monica the Silent Witch’s pursuit!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
