  "description" : "The massive Deus Magna seems to pierce the heavens as it makes its appearance amidst a raging storm, and inside its cranium is the enemy, Guy. The Buranki Batolov and Mega-lala, along with Zampaza piloted by Kaoruko, wield the Bubuki from Laetitia`s fallen Buranki as they charge forward to stop him, each for their own individual reasons. But no matter how fiercely they attack Deus Magna, they can`t even leave a mark. Meanwhile, inside Deus Magna`s body, Azuma and his team enter the battle with Oubu to try to stop Guy and save Reoko.\nSource: crunchyroll",
