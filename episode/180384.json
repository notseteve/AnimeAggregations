  "description" : "The battle against the Neuroi is a difficult one, and the 502nd is worried that Hikaru doesn`t have what it takes.  She`s issued a challenge: if she wants to remain in the unit, she must use her magic to climb up a tall tower and grab a hat off the top.  She`s not allowed to fly, and worse, she`s only given seven days to do it.  As the day of the deadline draws near, she still isn`t making progress, but she refuses to give up.\nSource: crunchyroll",
