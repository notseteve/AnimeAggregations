  "description" : "Lucy escapes from the facility where she has been contained after killing much of the staff. A sniper shoots her in the back of the head as she is escaping and she falls off a cliff into the water below. Kohta and Yuka find Lucy and try to help her, but she cannot remember anything, nor understand the language. They take her home and call her “Nyu” because that is the only word she can say. Meanwhile, a Special Assault Team is after Lucy with orders to kill her.\nSource: HIDIVE",
