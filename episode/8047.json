  "description" : "When we last left Koji, he had Fusion Evolved into Beowolfmon and was trying to catch up with Duskmon. He wanted some answers but the baddie gave him the slip. Meanwhile, as everyone was celebrating the birth of Patamon, Sephirothmon decided to crash the party. He used the gang`s own attacks against them so he could take away their spirits. It looked bad for our heroes until Aldamon figured out that by combining their attacks they might get the upper hand. Mixing up their powers confused Sephirothmon and brought on his defeat.\nSource: crunchyroll",
