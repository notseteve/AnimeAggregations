She reveals a level of Home Ec Club-cultivated \"Girl Power\" that astounds her fellow members.\nKarin tells a story about a peer from middle school attending a social mixer. Sakura decides to have the club assume the role of boys and girls and practice so they`ll know what to do if they`re ever get caught up in a social mixer.\nSource: crunchyroll",
