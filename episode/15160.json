  "description" : "A highway accident involving a large commercial truck has left a fully prostheticized man dead, his body torn apart from the impact. Togusa is summoned by Aramaki to delve deeper into the matter as the dead man had recently tried to blackmail the Energy Ministry. The dead man`s name was Kanji Kotan and he had recently arrived to Niihama by way of T?ky?. Due to the rest of Section 9 guarding the Prime Minister (\"INDUCTANCE\"), Aramaki can only send Togusa, with a Tachikoma as protection, to dig up what he can about the man`s recent activities before he died.",
