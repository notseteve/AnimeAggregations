Today will we find out what Jon`s true motives are?! Dad returns from overseas with soccer fever. He monopolizes the TV and tries to force everyone to watch a soccer match. Dad is acting exceptionally strange today, because tomorrow is Father`s Day. He is trying to be the model father because his kids are to be writing him \"Thank you, Dad\" cards.
