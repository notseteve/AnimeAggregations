After learning about Izumo`s past from Mike, Rin and the others head to Peace Town Inari, which they believe holds the entrance to the Illuminati`s underground laboratory. Meanwhile, at the laboratory, Izumo is taken to a room where Michael Gedoin is waiting to undergo a complete medical examination.
