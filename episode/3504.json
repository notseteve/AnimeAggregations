  "description" : "The setting this time was sports day at our school, Tomoeda Elementary! This was the first chance for Sakura to meet my mother, Sonomi. We were also really surprised to find out that Sakura`s father knew my mother! As it turned out, he used to teach both my mother and Nadeshiko. Later, Mr. Kinomoto and my mother faced off in the parents 100-meter dash. My mother had held a grudge against him for a long time, believing that if her beloved cousin Nadeshiko hadn`t married him, she wouldn`t have died so young. But before too long, the race almost came to a stop, because the track had suddenly been covered in mysterious flower petals. It turned out that the Flower card was to blame, and Sakura used her amazing talents to seal it away, just like always! But my mother ended up losing to Mr. Kinomoto, and she got... well, angry. To restore the peace, Sakura used Flower to call down a shower of nadeshiko blossoms in honor of her mother, and my mother was so touched that she totally forgot about her anger. Exactly what I would expect from the Cardcaptor.\nSource: crunchyroll",
