  "description" : "Youji goes down the well to pull up the woman, a blonde-haired elf maiden. The Third Reconnaissance Platoon then returns to the nearby village of Coda with the still-unconscious elfmaid and tell the mayor about the dragon, which terrifies them, and they make preparations to evacuate. Youji asks the mayor what happened to the lord who ostensibly ruled over their lands and why he wasn`t doing anything to help with the dragon, and was told that their lord never returned from the last battle near the Gate.\nWhile the Platoon helps guide the villagers away from the dragon a group of bandits thinks to attack them and in so doing become their new lord. A demigoddess named Rory Mercury slaughters them without mercy. The next morning she meets with the village and the Platoon, and seems to take a liking to Youji.\nSoon enough, the dragon attacks them, and kills a sizeable number of villagers. Even modern weapons are at first ineffective against the dragon, until the elfmaid and Rory help the platoon to injure it badly enough that it is driven off.\nAfter the villagers bury their dead, most of them are able to settle in other villages where they have kin. The young apprentice of an old magician, named Leilei, the elfmaid, Rory, and a few others remain with the Platoon.",
