  "description" : "Shokei gets arrested by Ryu’s officials but released easily for bribing them.  Because traveling to Tai is dangerous, Rakushun offers to take her to En.  Shokei learns a lot from Rakushun but is still unable to understand her responsibility as a Koshu (King’s daughter).  Suzu’s party gets raided by gangs because she did not hire guards.  They are saved but Suzu starts blaming herself.  When others tell her it’s not her fault, she gets angry, which makes her relate to Master Riyo.  Yoko investigates to locate assassins and finds herself in trouble but is saved by a boy named Sekki.  Then she finds Seishu bleeding to death in the street.  At the boy’s dying site, people’s carelessness aggravates her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
