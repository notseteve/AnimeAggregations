  "description" : "Jil and his party enter an area supported only by thin pillars. They engage in a battle against a balloon-shaped monster called Barbar and, demonstrating well-coordinated team play, they defeat the enemy in the end, thanks to Melt`s magical tricks. The festive mood from the victory, however, is short-lived as the feebly structured area collapses due to the explosion caused by Barbar`s demise. The collapse of the area also extends to other areas on the same floor, thus causing Neeba`s party and the Uruk Army much chaos. In the end, members of all parties find themselves separated from each other.\nSource: crunchyroll",
