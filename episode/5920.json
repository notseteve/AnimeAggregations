  "description" : "After having gained large amounts of weight, Gan-chan is unable to fit into his hole in the wall. He begs Skuld and Urd to help him slim down. Skuld tries several inventions, including Mr. Sauna, Mr. Icy Bath, and Mr. 4000 Years, but they all fail. Urd gives Gan-chan a pill that causes him to exercise. He exercises furiously, and collapses exhausted after crossing the entire world. However, when everybody wakes up the next morning, they discover that Gan-chan ate like a pig following his exercise and regained his weight.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
