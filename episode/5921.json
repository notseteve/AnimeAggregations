  "description" : "After eating a moldy cake, Gan-chan becomes ill. Urd and Skuld attempt to cure him using their potions and inventions, but to no avail. They try sprinkling salt, giving him exercise pills, silica gel, and a vacuum, but all to no avail. Finally, Urd seems to have solved the problem — only to discover that, as a side effect, Gan-chan has turned into mini-Godzilla named Gabira.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
