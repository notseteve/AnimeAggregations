  "description" : "Hikaru says he wants to be a pitcher because \"it looks fun\". Despite his terrible grip and form, his brutally fast balls are something to be reckoned with! After appointing Daigo his training partner, Hikaru casually suggests that the two of them form a battery.\nDaigo refuses the idea as impossible, based on his arm being weak. However, his sister Izumi points out that his personality and knowledge of baseball would actually make him a good catcher.\nSource: crunchyroll",
