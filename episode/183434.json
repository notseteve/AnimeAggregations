  "description" : "Using some facts she just picked up, Morina recommends a bittersweet tiramisu to a man often seen at the shop. Then a hurricane of sweet adult nothings blows around her. Could this guy possibly be…?!\nMaro and the gang strike a weird pose and sound off with a cry of “the butcher knife that burns in flame.” Morina, who could not sync up, gets left behind. An elderly man and his kimono-wearing granddaughter arrive, and Festa prepares “the usual” for them. Can Morina serve them flawlessly under such a tense mood?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
