  "description" : "Botan`s powers are incredible, but she doesn`t get much use out of them in daily life, so she doesn`t know what to do with herself.  Karin greatly admires Botan`s strength. Botan proclaims that her strength is not physical, but mental. Claire just can`t help herself in the face of Karin`s cuteness.  A certain event inspires Botan to tell the other girls about her lonely life in middle school. \nSource: crunchyroll",
