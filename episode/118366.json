  "description" : "The Ma-pet Sei is in love with the canary Ran. Sei tries everything in his repertoire to make Ran fall for him, but for some reason she is not receptive. Ringo and her friends watch over his efforts. They were also curious about the old man who kept sighing. His name is Oka Masaki and he runs a Haiku club in the neighborhood. Apparently the reason that Ran is so cold is because of him. The truth is that Oka is having trouble coming up with a good Haiku. According to him, Ran sings with her beautiful voice when you recite a good Haiku to her, but that hasn’t happened in some time…  In order to cheer him up, Ringo and her friends decide to help him come up with a Haiku. Will they ever hear Ran sing again? And what about Sei’s love?\nSource: crunchyroll",
