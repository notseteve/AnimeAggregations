  "description" : "Yamada has moved in with Hagu, and the two invite Takemoto, Morita, and Mayama over for a strange dinner. It`s shown to humorous effect that Hagu and Professor Hanamoto greatly miss each other. After dinner, Mayama asks why they are gathered together, and no one seems to know. Takemoto replies that it`s his birthday, and everyone is very embarrassed. They all attempt to make up for it. Morita makes a Twister mat and cards with too many colors, and he and Takemoto become hopelessly entangled in it. Morita makes a joke about Mayama`s stalking, and Mayama leaves. Yamada sees him off. After Mayama has left, Yamada looks up at the sky and wonders how to give up on Mayama, and whether it`s worth it. Mayama, meanwhile, sits and stares at Rika`s window. The next day, Yamada has to leave Hagu alone in the apartment for a night. Takemoto remembers that he made it through his first night alone because of his friends, so he goes to visit Hagu. The two sit and talk late into the night.\nSource: Wikipedia",
