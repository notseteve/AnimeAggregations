  "description" : "Chizuru does not understand her current feelings for Arata and starts to avoid him to try and “see things from a different perspective”. However, after talking it over with Honoka and Rena, she asks Arata out for a Christmas date. During the date, they end up buying phone straps for each other. As they walk home later, Arata blurts out that he loves Chizuru. Chizuru is taken aback, but then realizes her own feelings for Arata are also of love and tells him so. It starts to rain and they both walk back hand in hand holding Chizuru’s umbrella.\nSource: Wikipedia",
