  "description" : "Morihito is targeted by the very tropey Student Council. Ibara Ibu, the sexy, older sister Vice President who throws roses. Yuzuru Kenmochi, the other Vice President with a Kansai accent and closed eyes who definitely won`t betray you. The European-style tsundere loli and Japanese-style horror cool-dere twin sister secretaries. The treasurer, who looks like an elementary school student, but is a genius hacker. The musclehead beast P.R. Officer. The psychotic knife-licking crazy General Affairs officer, and also in the same office, a mysterious robot-man. Lastly, the one who stands above them all, the Student Council President who won`t take his hand off his hat, Tenryu Kiyomiya. What will Morihito do?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
