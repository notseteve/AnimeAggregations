  "description" : "Yuuto is devastated when Yayoi tells him to stay away from Haruka so she can focus on her audition. According to Yayoi, Haruka has agreed to make her debut as an idol. Haruka herself seems to be having fun and working hard at the lessons, so Yuuto kills his own feelings and distances himself for Haruka’s sake. Milan, who knows Yayoi’s true personality, notices that there’s something strange going on with this whole situation. Then, Yuuto receives tickets to a live concert on the same day as the audition’s finals, February 14th, from Milan.\nSource: crunchyroll",
