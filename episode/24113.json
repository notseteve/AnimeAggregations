  "description" : "As usual, Triton and Pipi are fighting whenever they are together. Iru, Karu, and Fin are so worried about them that they guide the two to \"Singing Island\" to make them happy together. It is a very pleasant place, but they start fighting again. Then Pipi leaves the island earlier by herself. When Triton finds that Pipi has not returned to Dolphin Island, he rushes out to look for her. Despite their fights, he cannot leave her alone.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
