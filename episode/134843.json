  "description" : "Tagiru is on the Hunt for a Digimon that loves the smell of okonomiyaki, called Pagumon. The next day a Digimon called Jagamon, who makes people eating potato chips float in the air and disappear, suddenly turns up. Tagiru reloads Gumdramon to Hunt Jagamon, but they fail because of Pagumon. This causes Tagiru and Gumdramon to argue, and Gumdramon enters the rival Hunter Ryouma`s Xros Loader! Tagiru and Gumdramon are thus separated. In the midst of all this, Tagiru watches as something strange happens to Pagumon after chowing down on an okonomiyaki...\nWhat will happen to Tagiru and Gumdramon`s friendship, and with Pagumon who has fallen into an unforeseen crisis?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
