  "description" : "Kisara is in a great mood after getting a duplicate key to Shu`s apartment. On the other hand, Shu can`t find any peace of mind when she gets ahold of the company`s financial situation without permission and increasingly encroaches on his daily life by pretending to be his hidden mistress. But even more problematic is the current lack of living expenses. Shu finds out that the incoming deposit he was relying on is still on its way due to a misunderstanding, so he asks Ayano for some contract work. And thus, Shu and Kisara find themselves safeguarding the 25th anniversary party of Bayron City and protecting the mayor from terrorist threats.\nSource: crunchyroll",
