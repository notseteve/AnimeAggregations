  "description" : "Sakuta dreams that on Christmas Eve, when he is meant to have a sleepover date with Mai, he instead goes on a date with a student named Sara Himeji from the cram school where he works. The Sara in question has the same dream as Sakuta and goes on to confess that she has her own Puberty Syndrome. However, she says that she does not want her Puberty Syndrome to be fixed. Sara developed Puberty Syndrome after a heartbreak, and the symptoms of her syndrome ease her anxiety by making her popular with guys, which she has been enjoying. Sakuta warns her that this is a dangerous move. To which she retorts to provoke him, “What should I do so that I can love people. Like you do, Mr. Sakuta?”\nSource: Crunchyroll",
