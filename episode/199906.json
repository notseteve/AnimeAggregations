  "description" : "Fukurou has been able to apprehend all the members of Karasu and they celebrate the resolution of such a major case. Just as everyone has started to think things are returning to normal, Tokimiya, Mashiko and Hayato discover a disturbing detail about Nabari and the cursed tomes linked to many of their own personal tragedies. Unaware of any of this, Tsugumi has brought Nabari with her on a visit home to celebrate her brother`s discharge from the hospital. Nabari lures Tsugumi and Hitaki into the Kuze family library under the pretense that there might still be another cursed tome there, but he locks the door with a dangerous glint in his eyes.\nSource: crunchyroll",
