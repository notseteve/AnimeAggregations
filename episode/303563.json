  "description" : "Iana confronts Yomi, taking up Sol`s sword in his place, but it`s so heavy that Iana can`t even swing it. Yomi, who loves Iana, concedes the duel, casting his own sword aside. The matter is settled for the moment, but if nothing changes Yomi will keep trying to kill Konoha. No amount of persuasion from Iana seems likely to make Yomi give up. What desperate measures has Iana come up with instead?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
