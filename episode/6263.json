  "description" : "The gang headed off to the Rose Morning Star but the trip was cut short because the kids were sucked into Sephirothmon. While trying to find an exit, J.P. was pushed into another dimension. There, he became Beetlemon and beat Volcanomon but not before getting a big dose of self-doubt. Then his own shadow appeared with thousands of evil clones of his friends, telling him they never really liked him in the first place. J.P. fought through his fears and blew away the Shadow Beastie.\nSource: crunchyroll",
