  "description" : "Rimuru faced grave danger in his battle with Hinata, but he managed to escape in the nick of time by using a doppelganger to take the damage while he rushed back to Tempest. Upon arrival, he found the city in a tragic state, engulfed by blood and smoke. Benimaru tries to capture Myulan, the top suspect behind this disaster, but Youm and Grucius stand in his way. Swallowing his rage and grief, Rimuru realizes who their true enemy is and calmly questions Myulan instead of punishing her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
