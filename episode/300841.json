  "description" : "Sasaki`s heart beats faster every time he looks at Kawaguchi sensei. He puts her on such a high pedestal that he even reveres her as a goddess. As he is attending supplementary lessons over spring break just to see her, an armed man bursts into the classroom. Holding the students hostage at gunpoint, the man makes a selfish demand of Kawaguchi sensei, but Sasaki jumps right in front of the gun.\nSource: Prime Video",
