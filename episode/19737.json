  "description" : "Hyoga saves himself and strikes with all of his techniques, but they seem to be ineffective against Alberich. Meanwhile, Shiryu is able to climb up the ice cavern and return to the battlefield, thanks to his master`s advice. Alberich leads Hyoga deeper into the forest where he unveils a secret technique handed down from his ancestors, Nature Unity, where the spirits of the forest come alive and attack the enemy. Shiryu senses Hyoga is in danger and tries to find him. As Hyoga struggles to get up and fight, Alberich uses the Amethyst Shield, but is saved by Shiryu in the nick of time. Exhausted, Hyoga falls unconscious. Alberich reveals that his ancestor had fought Shiryu`s master while he was still young. Just then, Roshi remembers that about 200 years ago, he fought against Alberich`s ancestor and was able to see through the Nature Unity by becoming one with nature. In the end, Roshi was the victor. Now, since the Amethyst Shield is useless against the Dragon Shield, Shiryu has to face Alberich`s Nature Unity, just as his master did long ago.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
