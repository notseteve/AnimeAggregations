  "description" : "\"They are both opponents I`m closely linked to, after all.\" Okita and the Shinsengumi discover Ryoma and Izo`s hiding place, and Mugensai joins them as they pursue the pair. Ryoma and Izo hatch a plan to trick Mugensai with a fake chronometer and split up, but before they can carry out that plan, they are found by Mugensai and the Shinsengumi. Meanwhile, Yoshinobu turns to a still bickering Takasugi and Katsura for help in rescuing the captured emperor. Suspecting that he knows the true identity of his master, Kondo speaks with Mugensai.\nSource: crunchyroll",
