  "description" : "Early in New Year`s, Shiina sprains her foot. She hurt it while cooking for Yuuto, who, a day before, had found the hair clip that she dropped in the river. Sawamura and Abina comes to visit poor Shiina, but they bring Yuuto along as a surprise. After having a fun time together, everyone goes home, but Yuuto comes back, worried about Shiina. Yuuto makes dinner for Shiina, whose foot still hurts. It’s quite a sweet moment, and Shiina, who is interested in Yuuto, takes pleasure in it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
