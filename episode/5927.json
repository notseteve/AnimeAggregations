  "description" : "Urd babysits three little rats, named Ichiko, Jiro, and Juicy. When they all want to play different games, Urd replicates herself. When Urd makes an obedience pill, Juicy forces her to eat it, and it backfires. A thunderstorm arrives, to the terror of the young rats, but Urd reassures them. When they try to nap, Urd and Juicy snore so loudly that the other rats wake up. Finally, when it`s time for Urd to leave, she promises to come back and play.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
