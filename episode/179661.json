  "description" : "To everybody`s horror, Tsukushi`s shot hits the goal post. Mizuki and Kimishita still dash forward to go for the rebound, but Saku High clears the ball and the match is over. Everybody is shaken by this, especially Kazama and Tsukushi, who both feel something they`ve never felt before. Tsukushi does the one thing he can, he runs without giving his body any pause. That`s when Ubukata intercepts him and sits him down for a serious talk.\nSource: crunchyroll",
