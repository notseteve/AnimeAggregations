  "description" : "Miyako reveals to the other kendo club members that Reimi has been harassing her because during middle school she refused to go out with the captain of the men`s football team, whom Reimi had already been rejected by. Try as she might, Kirino is unable to remember the name of the potential fifth female member who`s studying at Muroe High School. Yuuji suggests that Kirino should call her friend up and ask for her name again, which she does. Armed with the name Satori Azuma, Kirino and Sayako begin to search for her.\nSource: Wiki",
