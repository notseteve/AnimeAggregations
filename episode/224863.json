  "description" : "It’s time for research fellows Ash and Goh to explore the Galar region’s Wild Area, known for Dynamax—a phenomenon in which Pokémon can grow to many times their normal size. Our heroes’ train ride there is filled with anticipation…and that mischievous Scorbunny has secretly come along for the ride.\nThey come across a Snorlax who suddenly grows to gigantic size and sprawls across a railroad crossing, still fast asleep! As the train speeds toward them, Scorbunny shows up to help. Working together, they get the Dynamax Snorlax out of the way in the nick of time—and Scorbunny convinces Goh to become its Trainer!\nSource: Official Website",
