  "description" : "This story begins in Tokyo during the Showa period...\nOne night, a young girl named Harumi and her classmates from Hiromi primary school are attacked by spirits at their school. Harumi manages to escape and is saved by a strange frog-like creature, who takes her down into the basement of the school, where she finds a group that call themselves the `Spirit Patrol`. Harumi asks the group for help saving her friends that were attacked by the spirit, and Chapeau-jii explains that this particular spirit is known as a `face eater`.\nApparently the Spirit Patrol was sent by the leader of the underworld to stop evil spirits having their way in the human world... but they don`t exactly seem very skilled when it comes to stopping them... will Harumi be alright by putting her trust in them?\nSource: Official Site",
