  "description" : "Before the race, Yamato receives counselling from Yasunobu, revealing that he still likes Suzuka. The appearance of Miyamoto and his recount of Kazuki then reveals to Yasunobu what Yamato keeps worrying about. Somehow, though, Yasunobu`s words sparks something in Yamato, and he then resolves to becoming first. After his first spectacular performance, he is met by disappointment by his teammates, because the first race was unimportant, he was just wasting energy. When he finishes second in the entire meet, Suzuka approaches to congratulate him, but he reveals to her that he wants first.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
