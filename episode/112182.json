  "description" : "For some reason Kaya was laying on the counter face down. Arashi suspected Hajime of doing something to Kaya seeing that she glared at Hajime every time she picked her face up. Arashi asked Hajime if anything happened, though Hajime does not recall doing anything. Kaya was actually trying to find a moment to get back at Hajime for making her drink the “Cutie Cherry Fruit Juice.” Kaya starts making something with the Kiwis that Sunglasses brought in, but Hajime and Arashi follow in taking strange actions.\nSource: crunchyroll",
