  "description" : "Despite the change in divergence, Mayuri`s death still takes place, albeit a day later than in the previous World Line. Kurisu theorize that, since negating Rintaro`s D-Mail stopping Suzuha delayed the attack, undoing the effects of the other D-Mails could bring them back to a World Line where they have an IBN 5100, allowing them to hack into SERN and delete the records that set them on their trail. Rintaro starts by trying to figure out how to reverse Faris`s D-Mail. After helping her evade a rival gang of Rai-Net players, Rintaro takes Faris to the place where her maid café used to be and tells her about the way Akihabara was. This causes Faris to recall some of her memories from that World Line and the D-Mail she sent: a fake ransom note, which prevented her father from boarding a plane fated to crash. The rival gang catches up to them but they are rescued by the arrival of Faris`s father. Speaking to him, Rintaro learns that he was forced to sell the IBN 5100 he had in order to pay for the fake kidnapping`s ransom. After accepting the reality of her father`s death, Faris agrees to send a D-Mail cancelling out her previous one, turning Akihabara back into a moe hub. The IBN 5100, however, still remains out of Rintaro`s reach. \nSource: Wikipedia",
