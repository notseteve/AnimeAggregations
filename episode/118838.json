  "description" : "Taiki Kudou is an uncommonly good-hearted seventh grader who \"can`t turn his back on\" someone in a pinch. One day he follows the voice of a Digimon in need and is granted a Xros Loader, a device that allows him to give Digimon added strength through the command \"DigiXros!\" Taiki becomes a General and is sent with his two friends to the Digital World, which is currently ravaged by war between the Digimon. Taiki and Shoutmon, the Digimon he saved, use the Xros Loader to build up a new army and join in the battle against the attacking Digimon!\nSource: crunchyroll",
