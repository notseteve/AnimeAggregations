  "description" : "Aoba and the other members of the character team are put in charge of figuring out where to have the welcoming party for the two new interns, Momiji and Tsubame. According to Hajime, this is a very important role and if they don’t do well, their reputation may go down. Aoba is visibly nervous now, but then Hajime also tells her that if they do too well, it’s also troublesome because they’d get asked to do it again. But then Aoba wonders if it’s okay for them to be an employee that doesn’t get remembered if they don’t do too well or too badly.\nSource: crunchyroll",
