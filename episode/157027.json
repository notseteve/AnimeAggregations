  "description" : "As Pretty Cures all over the world fight against Saiarks, minions of the evil Phantom Empire led by Queen Mirage, Himelda \"Hime\" Window, also known as Cure Princess, feels downhearted after losing yet again to the Saiark, having to be bailed out by another Cure named Cure Fortune. Blue, the god of the universe, gives Hime a Crystal of Love so that she can find a partner to fight alongside her. Excited to be able to have a friend, Hime decides to randomly throw the crystal to decide her partner, which randomly lands on a girl named Megumi Aino. Hime, along with her fairy partner Ribbon, follows Megumi as she goes about her shopping, helping others when they`re in trouble. As Hime makes her presence known, Megumi becomes awed by her fashion sense and decides to become friends with her, but is taken aback when she is suddenly told to become a Pretty Cure. Just then, one of the Phantom Empire`s commanders, Namakeruda, traps Mao, the younger sister of Megumi`s childhood friend Seiji Sagara, inside a mirror, reversing her happy thoughts to create a Hat Saiark. As Hime struggles to fight against it due to her fear, Megumi steps in to protect her, stating that even though she herself is afraid, she will never put her own safety before others. This awakens her potential and turns the crystal into the Pretty Change Mirror, allowing her to transform into the Pretty Cure, Cure Lovely.\nNote: Cure Black celebrates the 10th anniversary.",
