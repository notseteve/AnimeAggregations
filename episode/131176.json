  "description" : "Despite Okabe knowing the location of the IBN 5100, Kurisu advises against trying to steal it, instead suggesting that he stake out the location in order to find FB, with Moeka deciding to join him. As they observe the IBN 5100 being taken out, they follow it as it is passed along to several people, including Yuugo, before it ends up on a plane bound for France, where SERN is located. Rintaro, Moeka, and Kurisu go to confront Yuugo, who reveals himself to be FB and a Rounder who was forced to do SERN`s bidding to prevent harm from befalling Nae. Following the code of the Rounders for those who fail their mission, Yuugo kills Moeka before taking his own life. Rintaro then uses Yuugo`s cell phone to finally cancel out Moeka`s D-Mail, returning to a World Line where both Moeka and Yuugo are alive and the IBN 5100 is once again in their possession. As Rintaro gets Daru to hack into the SERN network to erase the data they have on them, he comes to the sudden realization that by doing so, he would have to return to a World Line where Kurisu is dead. \nSource: Wikipedia",
