  "description" : "The Empire is launching a seemingly foolish attack on the Entente Alliance in the middle of winter.  They lack the supplies to successfully invade.  Tanya realizes that this attack is a feint intended to distract from a fjord landing mission.  Sure enough, she is sent to lead the invasion of the fjords, and silence 20 cannon emplacements in time for the fleet to land and the Imperial forces to disembark.\nSource: crunchyroll",
