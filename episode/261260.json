The Dorodoro Brothers wanted to take back their master from Asmodeus and Sabro because they believed that they were their master`s number one pupils.

Asmodeus fights back by unleashing his evil cycle just the way Balam had taught him to. Also, what exactly is this history between the Dorodoro Brothers and their master?\nSource: crunchyroll",
