  "description" : "Sabina, daughter of a wealthy family of Pompeii, orders Cestvs to fight some thugs in the city. After realizing his own powerlessness, he asks Zafar to teach him how to throw a single knockout punch. Sabina offers to purchase Cestvs, but he rejects her offer, saying he wants to buy himself back on his own. Offended by his rejection, Sabina instructs Emden to thoroughly beat him in a boxing match. Emden agrees. He and Sabina have made a promise that will be fulfilled once he completes his undefeated record.\nSource: crunchyroll",
