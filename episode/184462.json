  "description" : "Yuu wrote an original song in an attempt to bring Fuuka back to the band, but she persistently refused to meet with him. Now, as their growing popularity online has earned the attention of the HEDGEHOGS members, they`ve been invited to play at a live club again. The members have no choice but to practice their new song with no vocalist, but Yuu still isn`t willing to give up. Can he get his feelings through to Fuuka?\nSource: crunchyroll",
