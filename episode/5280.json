  "description" : "Yucie is sent off to watch a church overnight while the residing sister is away, she ends up having Glenda show as well as Cocoloo. Glenda ends up leaving on Demon related business but the two girls stay and eventually have to deal with the arrival of a tired young man seeking refuge. There`s concern all around until the young man actually wakes up and acts like king of the castle and keeps referring to Yucie as Forehead. As it turns out, for some unknown reason he`s on the run from the castle guards who won`t say why they`re after him. The actual sister of the church opts to take care of him until he`s ready to go, which doesn`t take long as he`s after the local dragon. Finding that Yucie knows about him, she`s dragged deeper into things but there`s something about him she can`t quite shake. The episode plays out much like a good fantasy episode with dragons, cerebeus and big fight scenes, but for Yucie she finds herself feeling like she did when the prince years ago rescued her in the these same woods.\nSource: tv.com",
