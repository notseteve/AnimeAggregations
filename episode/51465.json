  "description" : "The Conductor lazily says, \"Ehh, the next stop is Loose Zone. We`ll be stopped for twelve hours or so. Yes we`re arriving at Loose Zone.\" Feeling just as lazy and loose as him, Tetsuro ends up being ejected from the 999. Maetel and the Conductor search to find him, while he clings on to dear life. Unfortunately, the search is fruitless and he is flung off the train. He ends up in a space tunnel filled with garbage. Running away from the giant garbage monster there, Tetsuro ends up on the path to get to planet Loose Zone.\nSource: crunchyroll",
