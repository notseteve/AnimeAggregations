  "description" : "Washizu is seen helping an old man find his way, and quarrelling and losing to Ayame over a drink in a convenience store, and he is seen to have softened up since the days when he was the most feared delinquent in town. There is a great deal of misunderstanding between Washizu and Ayame over a love letter Washizu is trying to give Ibuki. Ayame comes by to deliver ramen for lunch and is shocked to see the two of them in an intimate pose, and so leaves without collecting payment.\nA group of delinquents called Skull Union who were once beaten by Washizu see how he seems to have softened up since their defeat, and think that it is their opportunity to take him down. They enter the dojo and abduct Ayame, and while keeping her hostage they try to beat him up. He is unable to resist for Ayame`s sake, but eventually Yoichi comes by and frees her, and the two of them together manage to defeat the delinquents.",
