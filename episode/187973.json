  "description" : "Akane Kosaka asks Eriri and Utaha if they would want to work on the next edition of “Fields Chronicle”, a popular RPG series with 20 years of history. At the meeting, Eriri is told that her recent trouble drawing wasn`t because she was in a slump, but because she was bad, and Utaha is treated like an extra to Eriri. They`re both upset, but can`t help but be enticed by such a desirable project.\nSource: Amazon",
