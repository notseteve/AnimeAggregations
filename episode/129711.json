  "description" : "The Four Kings of the Abashiri Underworld have challenged the Spirit Patrol to a duel! Yukiko-hime and the others are off being kicked by `Kettobashi`, or about to be split in half by `Manuke-oni`... but Enma is just relaxing nice and comfortably - with no will to fight at all!\nIt turns out Enma-kun doesn`t do well in the cold - and `Nadare-kozou`, another one of the Four Kings, found out about this and decided the challenge would take place in the cold and snowy mountains! Plus Enma is also somewhat down after hearing the secret of his crown from Enpi-chan.\nWill the Spirit Patrol be able to get out of this one? And just who is the fourth of the Four Kings that just never seems to show himself?\nSource: Official Site",
