  "description" : "The race to the finish is thrown into chaos by Kyoto Fushimi’s sudden attack. In order to stop Midousuji from reaching the front, Shinkai Yuto stands in his way. Though normally strong-willed and easygoing, the numerous battles and mounting pressure have pushed him to his limit. Shinkai’s interest in only his own victories transforms into a desire to see Hakone Academy’s jersey win. When Komari sees Shinkai steel his resolve, he is captivated by his extraordinary “flesh.”\nSource: crunchyroll",
