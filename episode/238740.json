  "description" : "Isamuâ€™s new toy baton gets accidently zombified, transforming into the voracious Bato, who goes wild and begins to systematically destroy the entire house. Isamu and Zo Zo must calm him and clean the house before Mom gets home! Zo Zo has the great idea of having Snowra pretend to be snow sculpture, until Snowra, starving of freid chicken, becomes a terrifying monster.  Isamu is competing in a ping pong tournament when Baseball Zombie barges in and steals the ping pong ball! To save the tournament, Zo Zo must first beat the Baseball bully and his sidekick at their own game to retrieve the lost ball. Zo zo is honored that the town mayor has offered to build a new skate park, but first must take him to the barber for a new haircut. Zo Zo takes him to Barbershop Zombie who inevitably gives him a disastrous haircut, and Zo Zo attempts to save the day offering him a wig made of his own intestines.\nSource: crunchyroll",
