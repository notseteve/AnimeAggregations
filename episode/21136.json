  "description" : "Dororo and Hyakkimaru set out on a journey again. They spend a night at a temple where Dororo accidentally sets free Amanojaku, who has been trapped by a guardian god at the temple gate. Amanojaku happily runs down to the village where he causes uproar by doing countless misdeeds. Dororo tries to stop him, but the villagers chase her, taking her for Amanojaku`s friend. During her flight, she knocks down a stone monument, but this is no ordinary monument. It is there to seal off a dreadful monster. Now the seal is broken, and a monster called Hitokuchi-kajiri rushes out of the ground. It has been born of the perpetual greediness of an extremely cruel headman after his death. Dororo and Amanojaku run into a five-storied pagoda, with Hitokuchi-kajiri after them.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
