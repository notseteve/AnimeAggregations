  "description" : "At the Séance Shrine, Iroha wrote her sister`s name, Ui, and Yachiyo wrote the name of her former best friend, Mifuyu, on votive plaques. As if to confirm the truth of the rumor, Ui and Mifuyu appear, but they are twisted imposters of their loved ones. Iroha and Yachiyo are attacked by the fake Mifuyu and the master of the Séance Shrine, a Horse Monster, and find themselves in a bind that threatens to end their lives. Iroha`s Soul Gem gets cloudy, making her slowly lose consciousness. What sort of transformation will she undergo?\nSource: crunchyroll",
