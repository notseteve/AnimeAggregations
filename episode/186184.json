  "description" : "Kagami Kazuya is an ordinary school boy who has one slightly odd habit: he carries around the obi of a kimono that belonged to his late mother. This wouldn`t be a big deal, until the obi reveals itself to be a tsukumogami--an object that, after a great length of time, has attained consciousness! With a ghost in the silk now demanding his servitude, more supernatural trouble doesn`t seem far behind.\nSource: crunchyroll",
