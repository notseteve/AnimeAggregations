  "description" : "Lulu shows Kazuomi a book containing information about the Mystery Eggs. She then offers to shake Ikuto`s hand but he refuses. Amu is standing outside a store when a girl walks out. The girl`s cell phone rings, which Amu notices her ringtone is Heartful Song. The two talk, and Amu ends up agreeing to show the girl, Hitomi, Utau in-person. Amu is frustrated, but goes to see Yukari. After being rejected, Amu sees Utau out of the building. The two talk, but then Miki senses the presence of a Mystery Egg. They head off to see Hitomi hypnotized, singing and putting everybody in a trance. After Utau criticizes her, Hitomi Character Transforms to Singing Dream; Amu and Miki then transform to Amulet Spade. Amu`s Colorful Canvas is overpowered by Hitomi`s power, so Amu tries attacking with a new move: Prism Music, and succeeds. Utau then Character Transforms to Seraphic Charm and Angel Cradles Hitomi`s Mystery Egg into an X Egg. This frees everyone else from the trance. Amu finally uses Open Heart to purify the X Egg and free her. The Embryo shows up, so Lulu tells Ikuto to grab it, but Ikuto had left earlier on. When Ikuto arrives home, his violin is missing; stolen by Easter.\nSource: crunchyroll",
