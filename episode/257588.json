  "description" : "Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki hold a special lecture at the Academy for freshmen like Kawaki and Himawari. The teacher in charge, Hana, will also speak, but unlike Boruto and his team—who have actual mission experience and flashy jutsu like the Rasengan that appeal to the students—she can only use conservative jutsu, so she feels inadequate as a teacher and becomes depressed. A mock training activity prepared by the trio causes the class to become deeply divided, and Hana struggles to bring the class together again.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
