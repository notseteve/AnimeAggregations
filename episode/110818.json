  "description" : "Bunji`s friend Daichi is always running around in short pants. One day, he comes across 17 turtles and brings them back to play with. Bunji is all excuses because he doesn`t want to study kanji. As Mom is stressed over the situation, the spirit of early education and spirit of educational enrichment appear before her. Of course, it turns into a fight as usual. Mom thinks that Fumi is tone-deaf, but actually it`s a trait handed down from her. Wanting to do something about it, Mom hastily buys a piano. The two start to practice, but... Bunji is worried his friends will see him holding hands with his mother at the crosswalk on their way to school, now that he`s an elementary school student.\nSource: crunchyroll",
