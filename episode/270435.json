  "description" : "The pursuers from the Oniwaban Group haven`t made an appearance for over a week, and during this time Megumi familiarized herself with the Kamiya Dojo group. Sanosuke, however, was still unsettled and feeling frustrated knowing that Megumi was the one who made the opium that caused his friend`s death. Then one day, Megumi suddenly disappears. In a letter they found from her, it stated that she had left of her own volition, but Kenshin and the others found this to be unnatural. They decide to head to Kanryu Takeda`s residence, the man who was sending spies after her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
