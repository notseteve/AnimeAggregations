  "description" : "The heroines are in town, and want to buy an ice staff to help defeat some cave dwellers in the next dungeon, but don`t have enough gold. They find that they have a lot of extra equipment, and start by selling off their old bikini armour, the Mage`s armour for some reason fetching the highest price. They find they have a very large number of potent elixirs that restore mana and health all at once, and the Fighter decides to sell them off, reasoning that they accumulated so many because they never really needed them. That way, they raise enough gold to buy the staff. In the dungeon though, they are nearly defeated by the cave dwellers, and are low on both health and mana, and as such wished they kept the elixirs. A chest in the dungeon contains a second ice staff.",
