  "description" : "Daguza has taken Mineva (or Audrey) hostage, but Frontal rejects his demand for a ceasefire and declares that he will sink the Nahel Argama. In order to save Audrey, Banagher sorties in the Unicorn Gundam, with the support of the Anaheim executive Alberto. However, Alberto`s true intention is to have Frontal destroy the Unicorn Gundam, and thus block his path to obtaining the Box. The Unicorn Gundam changes into Destroy Mode, and Banagher engages the Sinanju, but he is taken captive along with the Unicorn Gundam when Marida`s Kshatriya launches a surprise attack. Banagher is dragged away to the resource satellite Palau, the stronghold of the Neo Zeon remnants known as the Sleeves. The masked Full Frontal is waiting there to meet him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
