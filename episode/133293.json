Taiki has started a basketball team, Xros Heart, with his school underclassmen Yuu and Tagiru. Life has been peaceful. Then, one day, the air before Taiki flickers and a monstrous shadow flashes before his eyes. He then meets three mysterious characters - Ryouma, Ren, and Airu - who tell him \"This town may become a bit chaotic. Our own game is about to begin.\" What could these words mean...?!\nThe next day, Tagiru hears the voice of a Digimon on the verge of death, Gumdramon. This leads him to DigiQuartz, a game world inhabited by Digimon. Fascinated by a Digimon Hunt he witnesses there, Tagiru teams up with Gumdramon and starts on his way to becoming a Digimon Hunter!\nSource: crunchyroll",
