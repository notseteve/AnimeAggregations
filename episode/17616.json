  "description" : "After many weeks of looking for Chaos Emeralds, Nelson suggests that everyone takes a break and goes for a cruise on one of his spare yachts. However, the ship isn`t big enough for Sonic to run on, at all. Everyone is worried, so an airlift is called in to send Sonic away, but Tanaka is on it, and he has a group of elderly women on board. He says they will be their coaches, guiding them on how to relax, leaving Sonic on the ship, just as he tricks Tails into thinking the X Tornado is lonely, and lies to Amy that she is the cutest thing he`s ever seen (lol!). Just as the ship approaches the glaciers, the Egg Fort 2 launches for the first time with an attack",
