However, the crowd keeps going over to the more luxorious Chinese cuisine RS`s stand instead. Soma ends up in the red on the first day. Since students who end up with losses during this school festival will be expelled, Soma is already in trouble. Will he be able to turn things around?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
