  "description" : "The old world is gone, and Yamato stands poised to remake the world as he sees fit. Hibiki is determined to thwart him, but it will take all his resources as Yamato reveals the true extent of the demon-summoning app`s powers. Using its function of demonic fusion, Yamato brings forth Satan himself.  In the end, only one will stand before Polaris, who will grant not simply an audience -- to the victor will go the chance to wish for anything they desire.\nSource: crunchyroll",
