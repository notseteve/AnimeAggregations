  "description" : "The gang does battle with the rat, but their attacks are largely ineffective in part due to the design of the mechas. They try to escape, but the rat calls in reinforcements and blocks their path. Gan-chan is volunteered to act as a distraction. A piece of cheese is strapped to his mecha and he manages to distract the rat gang. Urd and Skuld find the treasure, but it turns out to be a windup doll of a golden Buddha statue.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
