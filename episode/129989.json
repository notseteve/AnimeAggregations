  "description" : "Kinji is apparently called by Aria to the girls dormitory, to find that it is Riko disguised as Aria, who again tries to seduce him. The real Aria arrives and tries to fight her, but Kinji stops her, saying that she must have been able to return by bargaining with the government. Riko tells them that she plans to steal back her treasure from Vlad, the second in command of the E.U., and wants their help doing it. Aria and Kinji reluctantly agree.\nShirayuki sees Kinji and Riko walking together in the rain and takes exception to her, and they have a brief fight before Riko leaves. Shirayuki tries to seduce Kinji again by locking them together in the school infirmary and taking off her clothes, but Kinji manages to escape by a window.",
