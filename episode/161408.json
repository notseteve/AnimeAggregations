  "description" : "Matsutaro won the Makushita championship, but he`s bummed that he doesn`t get to be in a championship parade. He wants to get in a convertible, get cheered on by festive onlookers, and drive by Reiko`s house. He wants a parade, darn it, and if he doesn`t get it, he`s shaving his hair and retiring from sumo! The master and Matsutaro`s buddy Tanaka are aghast. Is Matsutaro going to shave his head and quit, or what?\nSource: crunchyroll",
