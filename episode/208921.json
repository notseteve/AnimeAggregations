  "description" : "Shin Hazama is a normal high school boy living an ordinary life in Tokyo… a life that is about to be turned upside-down when he encounters Jin, a boy who looks identical to him but claims to originate from another world entirely.\nJin’s world is one very different to our own - a world where an evil queen named Kotoko serves as its dictator, controlling all wealth and crushing any opposition with lethal force. Perhaps more importantly for Shin, the next step in Kotoko’s plan for total domination is to expand her realm by invading his world.\nSource: crunchyroll",
