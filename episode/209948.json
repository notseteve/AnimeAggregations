  "description" : "Kitaro and the others are visiting a certain mansion deep in the mountains. According to the letter they received in the youkai post, a girl named Yayoi is being targeted by the youkai Hakusanbou. The Sand-throwing Hag sets a youkai repelling barrier around Yayoi and prepares for attack. But when Hakusanbou appears, he shows no intention of attacking. He hasn`t come to eat Yayoi, he`s come to take her for his bride. While Kitarou and Hakusanbou talk, Yayoi is suddenly stricken with pain. Somehow, the Ring of Arcana has appeared in her body. Sensing the manifestation of the ring, Adele appears and kidnaps Yayoi!\nSource: crunchyroll",
