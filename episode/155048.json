  "description" : "A sniper named Tsumugu Kinagase targets Ryuko, but is interrupted by the gardening club. After dealing with the biology club, Ryuko is attacked by Tsumugu, who holds her down and demands that she strip, but retreats when he is interrupted by Aikuro. That night, Aikuro tells Tsumugu to leave Ryuko alone, but Tsumugu is concerned that Ryuko`s Kamui could be a greater threat than the Kiryuins. The next day, Ryuko confronts Tsumugu, but their fight is interrupted by the gardening, rakugo, and poetry clubs. Senketsu gives himself up to protect Ryuko, but Mako stands up to Tsumugu and returns Senketsu to Ryuko. As Tsumugu comes to understand the bond between Ryuko and Senketsu, they are confronted by one of the Elite Four, Nonon Jakuzure, but Tsumugu helps the two escape.",
