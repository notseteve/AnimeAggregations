  "description" : "Ali-san forces Iruma to go through his evil cycle. His classmates are both in shock and admiration in how much more confident Iruma seems. Meanwhile, Iruma realizes how terrible of an environment the Misfit Class`s classroom is, so he proposes something to Kalego. His proposal was to move the Misfit Class to the classroom with the utmost importance at Babyls, the Royal One! Despite the rather sudden and ridiculous request, Kalego agrees if Iruma is able to fulfill certain terms.\nSource: crunchyroll",
