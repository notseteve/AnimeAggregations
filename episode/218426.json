  "description" : "Kakashi goes to the post office—disguised as Sukea, a freelance journalist—to observe Team 25, whose mission is to assist with sorting mail. Houki Taketori, Hako Kuroi, and Renga Kokubou are genin and Boruto`s former classmates. As a team, they haven`t distinguished themselves, so the missions they are assigned to always consist of simple tasks. Furthermore, they lack teamwork. To find the reason for this, Kakashi decides to talk to Houki, who for some reason dresses just like him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
