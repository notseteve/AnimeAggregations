  "description" : "Yinsen recalls when he was saved from being shot by terrorists by a woman named Sandra. Meanwhile, Tony is nearly finished with his arc reactor, but Yinsen apprehends the shipment of plutonium needed to complete it using the Dio armor. Iron Man and the two battle before Yinsen escapes with the plutonium, leaving Iron Man to fight the Zodiac warrior Sagittarius, but he soon loses him. Yinsen then contacts Stark, telling him that the people who rescued him were killed by Stark Industries weaponry. The two once again fight for the plutonium, with Yinsen insisting that Tony has not changed. He reveals several models of Iron Man Sigma, which he created by reverse engineering Dio, which he uses to attack the arc station. Yinsen defeats Tony, takes him out of his armor and chucks him into a river.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
