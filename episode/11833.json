  "description" : "Shiki awakens in Arcueid`s apartment, where Arcueid explains the difference between the True Ancestors and the Dead Apostles, and how her mission was to slay the latter. She then implores into the nature of Shiki`s power, which she identifies as the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, enabling Shiki to see the fated destruction of an object, and erase it from existence. As a result, she employs a trap using herself as bait for Nrvnqsr, while Shiki will kill him when he arrives. As Nrvnqsr arrives, Shiki attacks him, but is quickly repelled. However, Nrvnqsr`s overconfidence allows Shiki to bypass his guard and kill him. As Shiki collapses, Arcueid kisses him on the forehead, thanking him for his work.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
