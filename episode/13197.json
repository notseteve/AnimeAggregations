  "description" : "Besides saving himself, Shun`s attack on ArIes`s also freed Cygnus from his flight through another dimension. When he arrived back to his own dimension, Cygnus found himself in the house of Libra. There, he met Crystal`s (Cygnus`s mentor) mentor the gold saint of Aquarius. Aquarius informs Cygnus that he has been ordered not to let Cygnus through this house, and he attacks Cygnus as he tries to pass. Unwilling to fight Aquarius, his acting mentor, Cygnus tries instead to convince him of ArIes`s evil ways, hoping this will persuade him into letting him pass. It doesn`t work. Instead, Aquarius has his own agenda: to help Cygnus discover his seventh-sense. But Cygnus is unwilling to let go of the memory of his mother and is subsequently held back and unable to achieve his seventh-sense power. So, wanting Cygnus to die painlessly, instead of at the hands of an evil gold saint, Aquarius attacks Cygnus with a powerful blow and enshrines him in a large block of ice. Is Cygnus dead? Stay tuned.\nSource: crunchyroll",
