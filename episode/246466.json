  "description" : "At the request of police detective Hanzawa, Mikado visits an empty storefront. Hanzawa says that kamikakushi—paranormal disappearances—are often reported of that spot. When Mikado phones Hiyakawa, who is still back at the office, from in front of the vacant store, Hiyakawa possesses Mikado`s body and begins investigating the abandoned shop. He realizes that the store has been turned into a kind of savings box to store bad things and that it had been created by Erika at the request of a mysterious figure.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
