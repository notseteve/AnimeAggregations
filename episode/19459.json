  "description" : "Rei and Yukikaze fly back to Earth to test the plane`s new engines but JAM forces follow them out of the portal. An Earth-borne Japanese Navy aircraft carrier battlegroup, mistaking the JAM attackers for unauthorized FAF aircraft, is taken by surprise and quickly fall into disarray. The Admiral, the Japanese flagship, is only saved from a final ramming attempt by the aliens by Rei`s timely intervention. The Yukikaze is forced to land on the Admiral for refueling, and it is right there Rei would find out how ignorant Earth has become to the war raging on Fairy.",
