  "description" : "Tatsuya and the other Student Council members were spending their days extremely busy in order to deal with the sudden change of events for the Nine Schools Competition. However, out of the blue, Tatsuya receives an email from an unknown sender. The email states that the changes in the competition were due to pressure from the JDF, and that the Kudou Family was planning to piggyback on the JDF`s order to test out a secretly developed military weapon at the Steeplechase Cross-country Event. This prompts Tatsuya to head to Nara, where the Kudou Family`s stronghold is based, to find out more about the experiments they are conducting.\nSource: crunchyroll",
