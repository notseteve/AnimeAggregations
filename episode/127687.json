  "description" : "Mom and the gang have come to Dad`s birthplace, Hokkaido.  They immediately head for the market to search for crabs, but lured by Dad, they end up fishing for crabs in Hakodate Bay. The gang is now in Sapporo.  Mom is irritated because she is unable to obtain the crab she desires, but Dad and the kids say they want to eat Sapporo ramen. The gang heads for Asahikawa, but venture forth by regular train instead of taking the express train.  About when they get bored of the beautiful snowscape extending as far as they can see, the train stops for snow removal. Mom and the gang have come to the Asahimori Zoo.  Watching Bunji and Fumi happily play with the penguins and seals, Mom and Dad are sincerely glad to have brought them to Hokkaido.\nSource: crunchyroll",
