  "description" : "Jean Pierre Polnareff holds the key to defeating the boss. The one who appeared before him wasn’t Bucciarati or his squad, but the leader of Passione, Diavolo himself. Diavolo tries to eliminate Polnareff once and for all and summons Emperor Crimson, but then Polnareff summons Silver Chariot and it is pierced with the arrow. That’s when something happens to everyone in or nearby the Colosseum. They find themselves losing strength and all fall asleep. After waking from their deep sleep, they all realize something has changed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
