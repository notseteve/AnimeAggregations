  "description" : "Ratco Rats are building a rail depot at Rock Springs in the Australian outback. The only thing in their way is a eucalyptus forest and it`s resident Koalas. They are planning to sell the Koalas to a local Tourist Park when the Bamboo Bears rescue the Koalas and find them a new home downstream. Rataleone is not amused - especially when he has to inform his Rats that the train is due to pass at Spring`s Rock and not Rock Springs!\nSource: bcdb.com",
