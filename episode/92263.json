  "description" : "Tooru runs away with Shiro, trying to escape the Oni. Kuu is following with the Department of Custody agents. Tooru`s friend helps him sneak past the Oni, and Tooru goes to ask Ogami for a place to stay. The Oni find him, but Mubyou shows up to beat them down as Tooru and Shiro run off. Meanwhile, Noboru and Kou are cooking. Kuu learns that one of the agents she is following around is Tsukuyomi, the one who sealed her. Kuu comes to a decision that the agents want to seal Shiro, due to her pale white skin, (white symbolizes the clouds, and is therefore a sign of rebellion against the gods because clouds cover the symbol of the gods, the sun), and that Shiro was in the Land of the Gods. So they leave Kuu behind, telling her not to interfere. Noboru and Kou go in search of Tooru now that they know he is missing, and Tooru and Shiro meet up with Sakura, and the Oni appear to take Shiro with the new familiar, Dema, which they have purchased.\nSource: crunchyroll",
