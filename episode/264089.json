  "description" : "Isagi captures everything that’s happening in the field to see its future, and Nagi controls the space. Their combination bursts, and their series of play lights up the fire in Rin. Rin’s dominating play that encompasses everything on the field, from the skills of all players, the ball, positioning and tactics gradually corners Isagi’s team once again. As chaos and ego clash, one man is covertly sharpening his fangs to devour the game dominated by Rin.\nSource: crunchyroll",
