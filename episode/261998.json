  "description" : "We follow Mahiro Oyama, an unemployed good-for-nothing shut-in, who not only hasn`t left the house in two years, but is also exceedingly addicted to gross video games. One afternoon, he wakes up and notices that his body feels a little off. Finding that strange, he goes to reach for his tablet, but what does he see in his reflection, but an adorable young lady. I wonder what lies in store for the \"former\" big brother, Mahiro as he`s thrust headfirst into his new life as a girl.\nSource: crunchyroll",
