  "description" : "As the heroine reflects on her multiple timeloops, she focuses on the details about the assistant given to her by her grandfather and the doctor looking after him. During a certain timeloop between the fourth and fifth times, the fairies make a bug which takes the heroine \"far away\", where she encounters a boy whom she thinks is the assistant, and finds him to be an excitable and lecherous young boy who calls himself the Ringo Kid. It turns out that Ringo Kid was the younger version of the heroine`s grandfather from the distant past. After hearing more about him from her doubles during the fifth time, the heroine meets the assistant on the sixth. She finds him to have a more gentle and plain personality, and believes he had finally found his true personality using doubles to gather opinions from others about how he should be.",
