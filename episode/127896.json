  "description" : "The episode acts as an epilogue to the main storyline. In 1936, Yukina visits Natsume`s family in Japan to give back his belongings. Natsume`s sister requests Yukina to give a five sen coin, which Natsume treasured, to their younger brother who is serving the Asabu regiment. Meanwhile, Kazura receives a mission from the Kempeitai to investigate on a group of young military officers who were planning a coup d`état. When he learns that they do intend to start a rebellion, he misleads the Kempeitai and is forced to flee when they realize Kazura has tricked them. Aoi, revealed to be still alive, and Yukina arrive to save him from execution. While hiding from the Kempeitai, Kazura reveals to his friends that he will join the rebellion. Yukina gives him Natsume`s coin so that he will be the one to give it to Natsume`s brother if they ever meet. After Kazura leaves, Aoi goes back home with Shizune, who no longer remembers the events in Manchuria. Yukina narrates that the rebellion that the young military officers started would be later known as the February 26 Incident. As she doesn`t know Kazura`s real name, Yukina is unable to ascertain his exact fate.\nSource: Wikipedia",
