  "description" : "Having lost to Kaioh, Kenshiro is cruelly crucified. Shachi watches protectively from the shadows, but then challenges Kaioh, who wields a superior North Star Lapis Lazuli Fist, to a direct confrontation. However, Shachi doesn`t stand a chance against him. Just as Kaioh is about to deliver the finishing blow to Shachi, Akashachi showers him in concentrated sulfuric acid, stalling him long enough to rescue Kenshiro and Shachi. Lin gets swept out of sight in the current... And Akashachi, while trying to finish Kaioh off, meets his end at Kaioh`s hands.\nSource: crunchyroll",
