  "description" : "Warrior of the Monkey, Sharyu, is a powerful fighter with the ability to manipulate the three states of matter with ease. Rather than using her power to fight, though, she travels the world as a negotiator, seeking to bring about ceasefires and peace agreements. She seeks peace at the Juni Taisen, as well. But when her lone ally, Nezumi, the Warrior of the Rat, asks her if people are really worth saving, she is reminded of her experiences on the battlefield.\nSource: crunchyroll",
