Meanwhile, Gammon, who is contemplating whether he should become a Giver, becomes concerned that the POG may start targeting Nonoha. He calls Kaito and Nonoha out, saying that they should stay away from each other. When they object, Gammon challenges Kaito in a puzzle of his own design, in which they must attempt to trap each other in laser walls. After Kaito uses his Orpheus state to solve the puzzle, Gammon walks off and decides to become a POG Giver.",
