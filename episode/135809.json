  "description" : "Zeref reveals to Hades that his power had never been sealed to begin with, making Grimoire Heart`s efforts to reawaken him pointless. Accusing Hades of summoning the dragon called Acnologia through his guild`s actions, Zeref kills him. Ultear, meanwhile, confesses to Meredy about destroying her hometown and tries to drown herself out of guilt, but Meredy rescues and forgives her. On Tenrou Island, Makarov postpones the S-Class exam because of the battle, and Cana finally tells Gildarts that she is his daughter. As this happens, Acnologia forebodingly flies towards Tenrou Island as Zeref watches in alarm.",
