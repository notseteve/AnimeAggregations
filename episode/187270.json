  "description" : "It`s midsummer, and as the sun`s rays grow stronger, the days grow so hot that they seem to burn the girls` skin. Hinako starts to worry when she sees Kuina plastered to her desk in deference to the heat. When Kuina asks why it`s so hot, Hinako`s answer is a profoundly simple \"Because it`s summer.\" Kuina has to accept that answer... but then she rises from her seat as if some great idea has struck her. She says that hot summer days like these make her want to visit the ocean, and suggests that all the Hitotose girls and Yua-chan make a trip to the ocean together.\nSource: crunchyroll",
