  "description" : "In the year 848, the recruits are split into two groups for a wilderness exercise to learn how to sustain themselves in times of peace. Marco has trouble leading his group due to the arrogance of both Eren and Jean. Meanwhile, Mikasa`s group learns of the presence of a gang of thieves, who managed to steal their maneuver gear. That night, the thieves ambush Eren`s group, taking Christa hostage along with their equipment. Putting aside their petty squabbles in order to rescue her, the group discover the thieves` hideout, using each of their talents to come up with a plan to ambush them. After Eren and Jean manage to recover the group`s maneuver equipment and put a stop to the thieves` wagons, the thieves hold Christa at knifepoint, but she is rescued by the arrival of Mikasa and Annie after Armin had signalled for help. As the thieves are arrested, with no casualties taken, Armin wonders if the thieves` attack was part of the exercise all along.",
