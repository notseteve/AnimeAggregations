  "description" : "Kusaka feels guilty of saying to Konoha that she is irritating and tries to apologize with the help of his teammates but fails. What`s worse of all is that she now keeps avoiding him whenever he approaches her. Manabe and Minaho then think of a plan by making a situation where the two are alone so they can talk, but they also miserably fail. \nThe day of the match against Mach Tiger has came and started. However, Shinsei Inazuma Japan loses a goal to Mach Tiger because the team was focusing on offense which left the defense in weak spot. To everyone`s surprise, Kusaka suddenly turns into his Berserk-er Mode and confesses to Konoha that he loves her! Can Shinsei Inazuma Japan catch up to Mach Tiger? What will Konoha do after suddenly being confessed to by Kusaka?",
