  "description" : "After the fierce battle, Seiseki is the team that stands victorious. Kimishita scored three goals from the free kicks, but it was Tsukushi who secured those free kicks.\nThus, even without the \"Three Arrows\", Seiseki was able to put on a performance worthy of their reputation. While everybody is celebrating their advancement to the finals, only Tsukushi looks glum. After the match, Kurusu and the others who brought the equipment back to the club room see a crying Tsukushi kicking the ball by himself.\nSource: crunchyroll",
