Orihime and Nel are about to be caught in the attack, so Ichigo Hollowfies in order to save them. Grimmjow shouts for joy when faced with Ichigo`s power. He releases his Zanpakuto and shows his most powerful form. Orihime watches as the battle rages on. She becomes frightened when she compares Ichigo`s ominous Spiritual Pressure to that of her brother who became a Hollow.\nSource: crunchyroll",
