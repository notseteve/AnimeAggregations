  "description" : "Ms. Makuwa and Kuku are hard at work for their “Uron Mirage” dojinshi. Ms. Makuwa is in charge of writing and boarding out the story, but is struggling to complete it to the way she likes. In the meantime, Kuku will practice her art since she has time until the event. Kuku also reveals to Ms. Makuwa that she became friends with someone online who replies to her on Chitter. They were going to have an offline meetup the next day. Sick with worry, Ms. Makuwa decides to secretly follow her to the meetup.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
