  "description" : "Today is the school`s annual Super Special Big Clean-up day, when the students clean up not just the classroom, but the whole school - and Mr. Gab isn`t letting anyone go home until the school is sparkling clean! Of course, B.B.B. and his friends can`t quite take the task seriously, and try to come up with ways to get their cleaning done easily. From the hallway to the classroom to the huge gym, a few well-placed bites make for a crazy clean-up day... eventually dragging even Mr. Gab into the chaos!\nSource: crunchyroll",
