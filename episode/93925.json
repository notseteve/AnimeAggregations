In class, a girl is using Zodiac signs, Tarot cards, etc., to predict what may happen to classmates. Amu wants to know, but in order to keep her exterior, she asks Rima to go. However, Rima says she`ll only go if Amu goes first. Later on, Lulu asks the girl, Koyomi, to predict her fortune. Disappointed, Lulu makes her unhappy. The next day, Koyomi is shown with distress, but she predicts a classmate`s fortune. The classmate goes to confess her love for Tadase while Amu and Koyomi watch. The classmate is rejected, and this sends Koyomi into rage, running off. While running, Koyomi runs into Lulu, who changes her Heart`s Egg into a Mystery Egg, making Koyomi Character Transform to Fortune Dream. While running after her, Amu`s Guardian Characters sense this, and Amu Character Transforms to Amulet Clover. Seeing Koyomi making misfortune happen toward townsfolk, Amu uses with Honey Bubbles to clear their delusion and stop Fortune Dream`s attack. Finally, it ends with Open Heart.\nSource: crunchyroll",
