  "description" : "Tsuna is injured from his battle with Tazaru. Furthermore, Tsuna`s confusion reaches its peak when he learns that not only Kyoko but Yamamoto, Haru, and the others have all switched places with their selves from ten years ago. But they realize the true meaning of the directions written on the letter that Gokudera from the future had, and move on from their dead-end situation. Gokudera and Yamamoto are encouraged by Kyoko and the others` positive attitudes. Tsuna decides to do everything that he can. Meanwhile, Shoichi Irie, the man in the photo, is meeting with Third Squad Captain Gamma at the Millefiore Family`s Japanese base.\nSource: crunchyroll",
