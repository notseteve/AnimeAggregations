  "description" : "Kagami`s teaching quality is on and off with his YD, but he manages to last in the job for over a month, so his sister brings him to Akihabara to buy anime to celebrate. He catches a shoplifter, who turns out to be the class representative, who escapes by calling him a molester. She tells him that because he hasn`t been teaching seriously her mock exam grades have been slipping. Later, the surveillance camera video from the store is leaked, and controversy sweeps the entire school, such that he is told to resign. He passes the class rep, who asks him why he hasn`t exposed her for shoplifting and he says that he not only kept silent to protect her but because he really wanted to quit teaching altogether.\nJust as he leaves the school a woman, introducing herself as Hiiragi Private Academy`s Headmaster, Hiiragi Koyomi, intends to hire him to teach at her school.",
