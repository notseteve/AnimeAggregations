  "description" : "On Valentine`s Day, after the two neighbors eat dinner together as usual, Mahiru gives Amane some hot chocolate. Amane accepts it as a normal Valentine`s Day gift, but Mahiru seems restless, as if she has something to tell him. When Mahiru rushes home, still unable to say what`s on her mind, Amane notices a small bag with a card at his front door. Inside the bag are chocolates that Mahiru made especially for Amane, who had said that he doesn`t like very sweet things. In return, Amane gives Mahiru a special present on White Day.\nSource: crunchyroll",
