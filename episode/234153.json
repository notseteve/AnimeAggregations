  "description" : "Childhood friends Aoi Satsuki and Arata Uzuki are tasked with producing a fan event as part of a TsukiRadi project. Aoi, the considerate and kind prince of Gravi, selects \"adventure\" as the event`s theme.\nBelieving adventurousness to be something he lacks, Aoi works extra hard to come up with an event concept with Arata. The answer they arrive at is a puzzle/escape room at the zoo that will give guests a taste of the extraordinary. The younger members take on the role of the guests as they begin rehearsing for the event!\nSource: crunchyroll",
