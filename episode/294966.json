  "description" : "The global hit manga series Detective Conan, also known as Case Closed, has reached thirty years in 2024. NHK is allowed rare access into the world of its creator Aoyama Gosho. How are the tricks selected and incorporated into the mystery? Aoyama`s mantra is to trust his young readers. Never make anything \"for children,\" because they will see through it. The program reveals the never-before-told account of how Conan came to be, how Aoyama wore himself dangerously close to the edge, and the story he really wanted to tell. The life and mystery of the man who never lost his childlike sense of wonder.\nhttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/4003192/",
