  "description" : "Raul and Fino find that Airi has begun working at Amada. She is resentful at being forced to have to take such work, unable to find the same kind of pride in her work that Raul and Fino have. There is a misunderstanding as Fino declares, according to their cover story, that she is Raul`s girlfriend. They meet the branch manager and one of the store clerks, who already know who they are, and gloat at how they will eventually destroy Leon, which angers Fino and Raul, who declares that they are not to be underestimated.\nMeanwhile, Sarah and Visor visit the manufacturer of a manufacturer of magical appliances attempting to get a deal enabling Leon to distribute their products. They see that they are able to get their costs so low by using monsters as slave labour, which is troubling from an ethical standpoint. They are then informed that Amada has just bought their company so they cannot agree to a distribution deal, and they were allowed to visit so that they would understand what they were up against.",
