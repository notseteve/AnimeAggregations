  "description" : "Shion and the rest of the fallen are revived, Diablo has joined the team... It seems as if all is going smoothly, but Rimuru then receives a report that Milim has declared war and Eurazania has been destroyed, and there`s still the matter of the Western Holy Church`s hostility toward monsters, even with Falmuth out of the picture. But at the same time, Raphael informs him that the Appraisal of Unlimited Imprisonment has been completed. At last, two years after Rimuru`s reincarnation into this world, he can finally fulfill the first promise he made here: to free Veldora.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
