  "description" : "Yukimura and Himuro allow Yamamoto to turn their experiences thus far into a manga and Yamamoto collects proof of love from her readers in return. The manga becomes very popular. Yamamoto, pleased with herself, says that an anime adaptation may not be just a dream. In the meantime, Kanade, still bothered by the love she experienced back in high school, gives some hard thought to the confession she received from Shikijou. Seeing Kanade so full of anxiety over the question, \"what is love anyway,\" Yukimura tries to give her some advice and pulls out a whiteboard where he begins to write out an equation.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
