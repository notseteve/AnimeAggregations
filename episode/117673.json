  "description" : "Rataleone is about to venture into fruit farming in the Rocky Mountains. He orders his Rats to spray a toxic pesticide to get rid of all the \"nasty\" bugs, threatening not only the insect life in the area, but all other animals in the food chain, including endangered species, such as the Peregrine Falcon. Our heroes try to intervene, but are captured by the Rats. Ai-Ai is alerted by a Falcon and comes to their rescue.\nSource: bcdb.com",
