  "description" : "Mazama Jin here. I go to school at Seton Academy, and right now, my happening high school life with Hitomi-chan is being threatened with violence! Everyone wants to be strong. I get that. So I told them this: true strength comes not from scaring people, but from loving them. Yep, just like Hitomi-chan and me. At least... I might have been able to say that, if the ones being violent weren`t a stupid hyena and a stupid giant dog.\nSource: crunchyroll",
