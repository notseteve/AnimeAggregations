  "description" : "After a seven minute introductory \"bringing you up to date\" type recap of the story, we rejoin Seiya and Shiryu heading to the house of Cancer. As they enter this house, they discover gruesome faces protruding from the floor and walls. Emerging from the darkness, mocking their horror, is Death Mask, the gold saint of Cancer. He tells them that the faces belong to all of his victims over the years, and he keeps them as trophies.  Shiryu convinces Seiya to let him handle Death Mask and to run on ahead to the house of Leo to save time; Seiya agrees. Shiryu is no match for Death Mask`s awesome strength, and he quickly finds his soul at the gates of death. But determined to save Saori and spurred on by the voice of his ageing mentor he returns to finish the battle. But after failing to even remotely injure Death Mask with his most powerful \"Rising Dragon\" technique, Shiryu realises he is no match for the gold saint. Taking advantage of Shiryu`s sudden loss of confidence, Death Mask attacks Shiryu with a final deadly blow … or is it?\nSource: crunchyroll",
