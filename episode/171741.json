  "description" : "Haku, Kuon, and Ukon eventually arrive safely at the capital with Rurutie and take lodging at an inn named Hakuroukaku. They meet Ukon`s little sister Nekone, and try the baths for which the inn is famous. The next day Haku and Kuon are shown around the city by Rurutie, and Nekone tags along, as she is suspicious of Haku and wants to know more about him, as her brother seems to trust him. The town is very lively, and they see Oshutoru conducting an inspection. Kuon tries to find Haku another job, and while he makes mistakes on the job people still seem to like him.\nThey return to the inn and Haku receives a letter, which exposes the fact that he cannot read present-day writing. It is an invitation from Ukon to meet, but instead of Ukon they see Oshutoru, who wishes to become Haku`s patron. He removes his mask and they find that Oshutoru and Ukon are the same person.",
