  "description" : "Seiya remembers how Marin was a good influence on him, but he knows he has to save Athena and Asgard, so he decides to defeat Alberich. However, Alberich reveals his Sword of Flame, which came with his Megrez God Robe and tries to slash Seiya with it, while at the same time, tricking Seiya about Marin. Alberich is willing to win no matter what it takes. Although Seiya barely manages to disarm Alberich, he is caught in the Amethyst Shield. Alberich then recover Thor`s Odin Sapphire. Hyoga senses Seiya`s Cosmo disappearing and rushes to find him. It is revealed that Alberich was there when Hilda was possessed by the Nibelung Ring and chose to keep it quiet. He plans to gather all seven Odin Sapphires, obtain the Balmung sword and kill Hilda in order to rule over Asgard and the world. Hyoga finds Seiya and Marin trapped in the Amethyst Shields. He then tries to convince Alberich to hand over the Odin Sapphires. Since it doesn`t work, Hyoga has no choice but to fight. However, Alberich gains the upper hand and is about to slice Hyoga.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
