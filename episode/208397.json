  "description" : "Help me destroy the ring to stop the Brigadoon Project. Agnes asks for Kitaro`s help without any further explanation. Kitaro fires his finger gun as he`s told, but no matter how many times he shoots, he can`t even scratch the strange ring. Frustrated, Agnes uses magic to push Kitaro`s spirit power beyond his limits. Unable to withstand the overflowing power, Kitaro struggles, but uses all his might to fire his finger gun. He thought that this time, the ring would be shattered, ut the witch Adele snatches it away just in time. Blackbeard`s men attack GeGeGe Forest again!\nSource: crunchyroll",
