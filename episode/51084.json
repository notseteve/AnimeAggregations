  "description" : "Odd Jobs Gin receives a job to look for a missing person, the daughter of a distinguished government official who hasn’t returned home in days. Reluctantly accepting the client’s wish to settle the case quietly, the Odd Jobs Trio goes to gather information at a club where the girl was often sighted. Unable to get any useful leads and tired of looking, Kagura tries to nab a man who looks similar to the girl, when the man’s condition suddenly changes. According to a waiter, a weird drug is floating around this district. Meanwhile Gintoki is alone in the men’s room recovering from a massive hangover when somebody calls to him over the door.\nSource: crunchyroll",
