However, Ringo and Natsuki get into a fight over how to help him.  Natsuki dislikes Ringo`s method of trying to teach him how to be more popular with girls, using her favorite girl`s comics as an example. As hard as Leila tries to stop the fighting, Ringo and Natsuki won`t make up and things only gets worse.  Even Chris warns them that if their feelings cannot become one, they cannot become Lil` Pri and can`t save Fairy Land. Will Ringo and Natsuki be able to make up?\nSource: crunchyroll",
