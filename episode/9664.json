  "description" : "Now that Cherubimon has absorbed all the information of the Digital World, he transforms into a very strong and hard to defeat opponent but EmperorGreymon and MagnaGarurumon try their best to stop him. Although, they are no match for him since he has all of the data. Takuya fires his attack at Cherubimon making the whole bottom half of Cherubimon disappear but it regenerates. Koji then realizes that to kill Cherubimon they must strike the head where the data is kept. Takuya, as EmperorGreymon, manages to reach Cherubimon and stabs the head, releasing the data and mortally wounding him. It`s then revealed that the true enemy is Lucemon and he releases his Royal Knights to finish the job that Cherubimon failed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
