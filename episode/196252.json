  "description" : "In order to find Matsuo Basho, who’s famous for his haikus, the Akudarma trio head to Fukakawa in 1689. They manage to find him about to go on a journey, but then he suddenly disappears. They read his famous “The Narrow Road to the Interior” to track where he’ll be heading and track him down in Matsushima, which is known as one of the three most beautiful places in Japan. However, it doesn’t look like Basho is going to read a poem there at all. Then Tokio and Calen show up and they have a haiku battle to see who can get the Dynamond.\nSource: crunchyroll",
