  "description" : "With a new goal in mind, the Digidestined kids arrive at the Rose Morning Star. After defeating two Phantomons to gain entry, they are greeted by Goatmon, a wise Digimon who means them no harm. He tells them of the ancient times and why Cherubimon was tainted. It turns out after Lucemon`s defeat, the three angel guardians lived in peace. However, Cherubimon felt outnumbered because he was the only beast type Digimon while Seraphimon and Ophanimon were human types. Cherubimon believed that Seraphimon and Ophanimon plotted against him and so he led the beast type Digimon into a war against the humans. When Seraphimon was injured, Ophanimon used her power to heal him and after much destruction the three angel guardians were sealed away. Cherubimon, though, had five spirits under his control and used them to create the evil legendary warriors.\nSource: crunchyroll",
