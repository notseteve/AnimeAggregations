  "description" : "Yuuji and Shouko reminisce of an elementary school (5th grade) memory. Yuuji, at the time, was considered a genius, surpassing 6th graders, and was very overconfident and selfish. A trio of jealous 6th graders try to blackmail Yuuji by writing \"I cheated on all of my tests\" on his P.E. uniform. Shouko, already in love with Yuuji, tries to stop them. However, she fails and is bullied. Yuuji notices them, and decides to save Shouko, by fighting the 6th graders. Later that day, Yuuji comes home beaten, and Shouko explains to his mother. Yuuji`s mother then lets little Shouko know that she is rooting for Shouko to gain Yuuji`s love.",
