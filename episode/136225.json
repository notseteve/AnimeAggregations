  "description" : "While testing his high-speed film video camera, second year high school student Kirishima Kaito sees a bright blue light, then an impact has blown him off of his footing and beyond the railings. He sees a hand grabbing his as he fell, bloodied, only to wake up in his futon the next day. At his school, a transfer student named Takatsuki Ichika comes to a third year class. Somehow the both of them has a familiarity with each other when his classmate Tetsurou approaches her and her classmate Yamano Remon, proposing that she joins a movie project he and Kaito are planning. She accepts it without hesitation, and Remon volunteers to write the script. Kaito`s classmates Tanigawa Kanna and Kitahara Mio volunteered later. When Kaito goes to test his camera after class, he finds Ichika fishing in the river. He finds out that she has nowhere to go, so he unwittingly offered her to stay at his house, given that his sister will be away for three months. Back home, as Ichika takes a bath, Kaito felt pain in his neck, then sees a flashback of what happened the evening before. Ichika finds him unconscious, with a sign of increased metabolism on the area where that insect bite was. Ichika then calls for her assistant Rinon to stop it, as she kissed him. Exactly as Kanna and Kaito`s sister Nanami arrive.\nSource: Wiki",
