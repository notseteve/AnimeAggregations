  "description" : "New information has come to light regarding an unusual race known as Bounts. Kisuke Urahara explains that Bounts are beings that gain eternal life by absorbing the souls of humans. Urahara warns Ichigo that he and his friends may be in danger because Bounts tend to target humans with high-level abilities. Lirin, Noba, and Kurodo prove to be very useful when it`s revealed that they all contain reishi sensors that can detect Bounts.\nSource: crunchyroll",
