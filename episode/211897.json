  "description" : "Inside a closed shoe shop, an old man named Isao packs up to move away. Isao and his family sort through their things, getting rid of what they don`t need. Later, something jumps out of a bag thrown out as garbage - Bake-zouri and other tsukumo-gami. They are in shock after being discarded by their owner. Just then, Ratman happens by. He sees an opportunity to make a lot of money, and incites Bake-zouri and the others to go scare those humans who don`t take good care of their things. A while later, Kitaro receives a letter saying that things have started moving around on their own, and sets out to investigate.\nSource: crunchyroll",
