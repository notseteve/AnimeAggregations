  "description" : "Hyakkimaru and Dororo come across the female spider-like demon Jorogumo which has captured a man. Hyakkimaru attacks the demon and wounds it, but it escapes. The travelers enter a nearby village which has a problem with men disappearing at night. The next day, the kindly Yajiro finds the ailing demon on the trail which appears as a beautiful woman. He takes her home, and after feeding her some ohagi, gives her the name Ohagi and leaves for work at the lord`s quarry. Although she is hungry, Ohagi resists eating Yajiro because of his kind nature. Yajiro offers to guide the ailing Ohagi out of the village, and it is revealed that local men have not been captured or killed, but that Yajiro has been helping them flee from the oppressive lord. Yajiro and Ohagi encounter Hyakkimaru who attacks Ohagi, but she escapes with Yajiro. Yajiro takes Ohagi to a secret passage in the mountain, but are attacked by the lord`s troops and Yajiro is wounded. Enraged, Ohagi attacks and defeats the troops, but this attracts Hyakkimaru to her. As they prepare to fight to the death, the color of Ohagi`s soul changes as she worries about Yajiro, so Hyakkimaru withdraws. The couple leave and Hyakkimaru and Dororo continue on their way.\nSource: Revolvy",
