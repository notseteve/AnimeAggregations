  "description" : "Tetsuro and Maetel are captured by a group of bug-humans named Insectors who rule the planet. They go to boil them to use as food for their children. But, the boiling point of water on the planet is low due to the planet`s environment, so they escape unscathed. However, the Insectors proceed to cover the 999 in a cocoon. They plan to use the 999 and its passengers as food for their children as they send them off to another planet with food.\nSource: crunchyroll",
