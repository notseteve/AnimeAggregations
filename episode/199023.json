  "description" : "Gouhara is the president of an IT company that is short-handed due to people quitting because of the low pay and grueling hours. While he`s fretting over his troubles, he meets Ratman and the two of them join forces to start a company using kappa. The kappa who come from Toono are hard workers who can be kept on with an hourly wage of three cucumbers, which overjoys company president Gouhara. The kappa are pleased that they can work in a place where they can eat lots of cucumbers. But, soon, they begin to wonder if they`re being exploited. They rise up in revolt to claim their rights as kappa!\nSource: crunchyroll",
