  "description" : "The enemies from the past return to have a little revenge. Being embarrassed by students a year lower than them some time ago, the Tokonatsu duo somewhat thought of a little way to get some payback. The system in the school, already being a little broken again for the third time, gave their principal an idea to give the students a way to settle their little fight. They decided to have a little RPG like game, on where a pair of two each time enters areas where they have to defeat the enemies en route to the final destination. The episode ends with an unfinished game and Tsunemura confessing to Hideyoshi, who screams and gets his team disqualified.",
