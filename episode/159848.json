  "description" : "King Meruem returns to the palace with Youpi and Pouf to find hundreds of thousands of humans lined up for the selection. Knuckle is hiding inside the crowd with Melereon waiting nearby while Palm stands by behind the palace and Ikalgo waits above the hallway. All of them grow tense as the King returns. Meanwhile, Pouf`s clones are searching for the Gungi board and pieces which will trigger the return of the King`s memories so he can hide them. At the same time, Gon and Pitou head to the hiding place in Peijing to heal Kite.\nSource: crunchyroll",
