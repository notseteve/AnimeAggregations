  "description" : "The last of the previous episode - Nagi is extremely embarrassed about what happened with Hayate that she can no longer look him in the eye. Maria gave him one million yen for three days worth of living expenses since he was asked to leave the residence. Yukiji, Himuro, and the Sister sniffed out the cash and Hayate got involved with them, paid for someone`s daughter`s medical bill, and so forth. All the money was gone! He was not only without money but also without a place to go. Who do you think shows up?\nSource: crunchyroll",
