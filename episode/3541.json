  "description" : "Yue revelaed that if Sakura couldn`t defeat him, everyone would forget about the person they care most about. So that was the catastrophe we had heard about. Sakura had a really rough time trying to defeat Yue since he`s still Yukito on the inside and she didn`t want to hurt him. She almost lost, and saw how sad it would be if everyone forgot their most loved person. Luckily, Ms. Mizuki was there and rang her bell to keep Sakura in the fight! Sakura discovered her own special star power and managed to defeat Yue! After he declared her the new Master of the Clow Cards, sweet Sakura said that she would rather they all be friends.\nSource: crunchyroll",
