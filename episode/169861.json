  "description" : "Hayato initially thought the apparent little girl might be Ui`s little sister and is thunderstruck to learn that she is actually Wakana Misato, Ui`s mother. After they go to Hayato`s home Misato has had movers bring over the last of Ui`s remaining effects, saying \"a married couple needs only one house.\" Hayato then takes a bath, when Misato enters and talks to him. Hayato tries to get her to call off his engagement to Ui, when she reminds him of how Ui had been so close to him when they were younger. As Misato leaves she slips and lands on top of Hayato in a compromising position as Ui checks on them. He makes dinner with his \"mother-in-law\", both of them aware of Ui`s inadequacy in that department.\nLater that night Ui gives him a massage, and this becomes a more intimate moment, as they tickle each other and kiss deeply, until Misato, who seems to have been peeking in on them, stumbles into the room.",
