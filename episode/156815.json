  "description" : "Governot Shimada has come to Kazusa, where there is no water and the harvest is dependant on the rain. Two men tie a pipe between their houses so they can talk even when they`re snowed in.  Even though they were alone, they could cheer each other up by talking, but then they stop getting answers...  The priest tries to raise a fava bean tree to help the starving villagers, but the kids at the temple eat it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
