  "description" : "The rowdiness of the classroom seems like how it usually is in Modern Magecraft Theories, but there is something wrong with Lord El-Melloi II`s behavior. Luvia, who had come to visit and attend one of his lectures, asks Gray the reason why, and it turns out it`s because his favorite tearoom has basically closed shop. Lord El-Melloi II heads to the tearoom to inquire on their circumstances as he realizes work just can`t progress at this rate, but when he goes down into the sewer system to investigate, an ominous shadow attacks him. Gray, worried that he hasn`t shown any signs of returning from the investigation, seeks help from Flat and Svin.\nSource: crunchyroll",
