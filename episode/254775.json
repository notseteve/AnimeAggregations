  "description" : "The intrasquad game will determine who gets promoted to the A team. However, no one is passing the ball to Ashito, who is not able to communicate with his teammates through his soccer. He stands in the middle of the field, unable to do anything. Date says that Ashito lacks \"individual tactics\" to keep up with the constant change of play. Akutsu, a senior player who attacked Ashito at the tryouts, appears in front of him after the game.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
