  "description" : "Finishing up the investigation at the Persian Gulf, Fujimaru and company are given a new order from the king. The new order is to retrieve a clay tablet that Gilgamesh had previously lost in the city of Kutha. Kutha was a city that suddenly disappeared after the emergence of the three goddesses, where every citizen had passed away. In such a quiet town, the entourage decides to split up in search of the tablet. Fujimaru suddenly wanders into a very frigid world. It is what people call \"the underworld,\" a space separate from the physical world.\nSource: crunchyroll",
