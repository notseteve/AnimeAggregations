  "description" : "Agnes is distraught over not being able to find the ring. Mana happens by. Seeing her glum expression, Mana takes Agnes to her beloved Sakaiminato to cheer her up. There, they run into Kojirou, the karasu-tengu. In the middle of their reunion, Agnes senses the presence of the ring nearby and flies off. Left alone with Mana, Kojirou tries to show off by demonstrating his ability to call up gale winds, but in doing so, he accidentally destroys the mound that had sealed away the terrifying demon Belial. With his powers restored, the demon Belial roars and sets out to take his revenge on the old karasu-tengu who sealed him away!\nSource: crunchyroll",
