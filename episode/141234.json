  "description" : "As the village prepares an electric-powered festival for the Human Monument Project, the heroine hears from the fairies that they are leaving to avoid the electromagnetic waves from the festival that are deadly to them. They leave behind a good luck charm and a curious manual explaining the dangers that come if no fairies are met during the day. During the festival, the heroine meets a curious girl named Pion, who is searching for her companion. The next day, the heroine and her assistant are sent to explore an underground structure, where they get trapped. As they search for the exit, the charm the heroine received turns into a fairy who tries to lead them towards water but instead comes across a group of acidic slimes. As they face more dangers upon reaching a computer room, they are rescued by Pion.",
