  "description" : "Responsible for the theft of the class funds, the application to play Tomodachi Game, and the exposure of all kinds of dirty secrets in Bad-Mouth Sugoroku, Tenji now tries to alienate Shiho from the others so he can have her all to himself. As a result of his attempts, a rift develops between Shiho and Yutori that threatens to destroy their friendship. But while Tenji is busy sweet-talking Shiho and planning his next move, a \"special chance\" appears for Shiho that might change the direction of the game.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
