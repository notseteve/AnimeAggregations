  "description" : "The organizing team of the game announced a shocking, special rule to be implemented. One “betrayer” will be selected from the six remaining teams to form a new team. Pitohui is selected from LPFM, and the team leader of SHINC, Eva, also joins. With this new rule implemented, Pitohui is happy that she can fight against LLENN. Eva gracefully leaves her team, hoping to fight against LLENN, too. All of the \"betrayers\" meet up on a luxury cruise ship set up in UNKNOWN, forming a most intimidating team named \"BTRY\"!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
