  "description" : "Xiaolang finisehd putting together the teddy bear kit that he got at the craft store. He was going to give it to Yukito, but Yue showed up and told him that he only liked Yukito because of the moon`s magic and that Xiaolang`s true love was actually someone else. When Sakura finished her teddy bear, she gave it to Yukito (just like I knew she would!), but it suddenly grew huge and tried to crush us! With a little advice from Yue, Sakura found the source of the magic, and stopped it. The source turned out to be a piece of paper with Clow Reed`s magic circle on it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
