  "description" : "While playing in the park, Conan and the Detective Boys find a man`s body in the bushes. According to the police, the man is Takamatsu Jiro, who worked in a nearby building as a moneylender, leading them to believe the murder may have been an armed robbery or related to money troubles. The blood on the rock used to kill him suggests the culprit is covered in blood. The children, who were in the park the whole time, didn`t see anyone suspicious, and the trail of bloody footprints they find ends abruptly.\nSource: crunchyroll",
