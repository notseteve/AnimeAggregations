  "description" : "Captain Ukitake and Captain Kyoraku face the punishment meted out by Head Captain Yamamoto`s zanpaku-to. Ukitake and Kyoraku were the first two men to graduate from the Soul Reaper Academy, but even though they are two accomplished captains fighting as allies, the odds do not appear to be on their side. After coming to Ichigo`s rescue, Yoruichi learns that her encounter with former subordinate Soi Fon is going to be much more than just a scuffle. After one hundred years of training, Soi Fon has developed plenty of talent as a warrior, though she may be a bit too sure of her skill.\nSource: crunchyroll",
