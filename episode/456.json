Takki tries to sell them as prostitutes.  Yoko, Sugimoto and Asano manage to escape, and meet an old man named Matsuyama from Japan.  They have a good time talking but the next morning, Matsuyama reports them to the police for money.  Yoko’s “good girl” attitude does not work here, and she also has to manage her shaky relationship with Sugimoto and Asano.  Then, Yoko’s sword sheds a light to show her a vision.\nSource: crunchyroll",
