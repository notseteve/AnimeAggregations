  "description" : "Their day off is peaceful, and Miss Kobayashi spends her time relaxing with the others as usual. However, while out shopping, Tohru suddenly stops to think on the street--Miss Kobayashi is human, and what will she do when her lifespan runs out and she dies...? They can`t be together forever. They`ll have to part someday. She knew that. She was prepared for that. Yet still, Tohru`s mind is in turmoil, and the final blow is dealt when the Emperor of Demise--her father--appears before her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
