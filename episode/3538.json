  "description" : "Christmas was just around the corner and everyone was figuring out their last minute presents. Sakura had everyone`s planned, but felt like she was still forgetting one. I had to get ready to film Sakura being super cute on Christmas day, so I didn`t wait for Sakura and Xiaolang to finish their school chores to walk home with them. Besides, Sakura had to go shopping with Toya for her father`s gift. When their school chores were finally done, they felt Clow Reed nearby and decided to check it out. Sakura had to call on the Mirror card again to go with Toya. After dealing with Clow Reed`s disturbance, Sakura realized she hadn`t gotten a gift for the cards and had Eriol help her record a hymn for them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
