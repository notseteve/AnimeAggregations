  "description" : "Zatch becomes friend with a strange-looking horse but the relationship is short-lived when the horse is launched into the sky by Zatch`s bully. Kiyo takes Zatch and Suzy to a botanic garden when a Mamodo attacks everyone in the garden by strangling them with plant roots. Kiyo and Zatch manage to free everyone captured by the tree roots with \"Zaker\". As Kiyo and Zatch prepare to defeat the Mamodo and his book owner, they are unable to cast the spell \"Zaker\". The opponent reveals that the book uses energy from the human partner in order to use spells. Kiyo, using his desire to protect everyone, manages to unleash a \"Rashield\". \"Rashield\" reflects the Mamodo`s attack back at towards the user and in the process the Mamodo`s book is burned.",
