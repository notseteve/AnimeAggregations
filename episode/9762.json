Rakuyou is headed by the fierce Fighter Toutaku, who has conquered a couple of the schools in Kanto. Other schools have been banding together against him. Meanwhile, while running late for school, Koukin reveals to Hakufu that he would be willing to sacrifice himself if it meant protecting her. Gakushu questions Saji over Nanyou Academy`s leader, Enjyutsu, whom he has not seen in months. Gakushu feels that there is something going on that he has been kept in the dark about. Enjutsu sees Hakufu as a threat and issues the order to Big Four member Kannei to execute her to prevent her destiny from being fulfilled. This order is given to the whole of Nanyou Academy, and results in Hakufu doing battle with Kannei and Ryomou, while Koukin fights all of the students and Saji. Will they all survive? And what is Saji planning?\nSource: theTVDB.com",
