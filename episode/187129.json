  "description" : "The mood around the training camp has darkened considerably as everyone has noticed Ageha`s absences at practice. After the shock of Haruto`s scathing words Ageha has shut himself in his room and refuses to come out. No one feels Ageha`s absence more than Hoshitani, who is concerned for a person he sees as a friend, but when he tries to speak with Ageha he is quickly turned away. Lamenting to his friends Hoshitani wonders if he can really do anything to help. The best advice comest from an unexpected source and Hoshitani is even determined to coax Ageha out of his room for sure.\nSource: crunchyroll",
