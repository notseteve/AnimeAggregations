  "description" : "Joshua battles Chrono aggressively in the sky, causing mass destruction within the city. Genai is stopped by Duffau when he attacks Father Remington. Seeing Rosette in Aion`s clutches, Chrono flies down to save her, but he is blindsided by Joshua`s attacked. In response, Chrono grabs hold of Joshua`s horn, making him yell in agony. However, Chrono turns into stone when he rips off the horns from Joshua`s head. Duffau destroys Genai, and Father Remington eradicates Shader. Aion escapes with Rosette in his possession. Back at the convent, Duffau explains that the ritual of atonement can be meant to purify or taint the soul of a human being, whether performed by an angel or a devil. Father Remington and Reverend Gilliam believes that Aion is planning to use the deterrence of Rosette as a weapon. Elsewhere, Aion shows Rosette the end result of what Chrono and Joshua did to the city, all in love for her sake. Aion asks her to join his side in order to save the inhabitants of the San Francisco. Rosette agrees to his proposition, but she still wears the soul timepiece as a reminder for her life. \nSource: Wikipedia",
