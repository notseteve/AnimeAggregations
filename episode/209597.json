  "description" : "While Asta and the other Black Bulls were fighting with Fana, Fanzell was facing off with the forces of the Diamond Kingdom, which he used to be a part of. The forces happen to be led by two of Fanzell`s former students, Ladros and Mars. Fanzell left the Diamond Kingdom because he didn`t agree with the kingdom`s methods, but before, he would train children on how to use their powers for the Diamond Kingdom. Fanzell tries to reason with his former students, but Ladros attacks regardlessly, forcing Fanzell to fight with them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
