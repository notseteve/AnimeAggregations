  "description" : "Raul continues to teach Fino how to speak to the store`s customers properly, giving her a set of eight basic phrases to memorise. On his way to lunch he meets Airi Oltined who was his friend during his days training to be a hero, and she chides him for seemingly abandoned his goal. Meanwhile, a masked man armed with an axe has come to the store, intending to rob it, but Fino treats him like a customer, not realising his intentions, which distracts him. When Raul returns, together they manage to subdue the robber, and are praised by Sarah for their efforts.\nThat evening, Raul joins some of his old friends from the hero training program and finds that they still haven`t abandoned their dream of becoming heroes, making Raul reluctant to admit to them that he got a job. When he returns to the shop he finds Fino asleep, and from her notebook sees that she has been practising the phrases he told her to memorise. She wakes up and asks him to test her, and she manages to successfully say them all.",
