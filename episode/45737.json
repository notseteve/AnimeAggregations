  "description" : "Inside a parcel delivered to their house at midnight is a portrait of a terribly distorted-looking man. They hang it on the wall, but feel disgusted to look at it. When they try to take it off the wall, they find it is stuck there. Moreover, the man in the picture emerges from the frame and sneaks into Chocola`s room.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
