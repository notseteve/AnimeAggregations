During P.E. class, the blue egg begins to hatch, unbeknownst to Amu and Ran, and Miki, Amu`s second Guardian Character, peers out. However, after seeing Amu and Ran in an argument over a Character Change, Miki runs off. The two soon discover Miki and give chase. Miki warns Amu that if she does not believe in her Guardian Characters, they will disappear. When Amu meets with the Guardians, Tadase, Nadeshiko, Kukai Soma, and Yaya Yuiki, she discovers that they also have Guardian Characters and they invite her to join. However, Amu refuses and runs away. Amu encounters a third-grade admirer, Suzuki, and an X Egg forms from his heart`s egg. Amu transforms into Amulet Heart and purifies the X Egg.\nSource: crunchyroll",
