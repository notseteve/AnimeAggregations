  "description" : "Joseph continues his final battle with Xargin with the nanomachine Isis injected into his body. The Isis will bring certain doom to Xargin, and to Joseph himself. Meanwhile, in the air and on the ground, Sasha and Mei-Fong desperately try to intercept the new-generation intercontinental ballistic missiles that were launched for the purpose of turning German territory into a smoldering wasteland. However, the ICBMs manage to deflect the interceptions with their state-of-the-art system and edge ever closer to German airspace.\nSource: crunchyroll",
