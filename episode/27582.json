  "description" : "Yuzu gives Kon a bath and on top of that, dresses him up in a dress with a flower ornament.  Kon is irate, but Ichigo pays him no attention.  After overcoming many difficulties together, Kon has developed a close affinity to the Kurosaki family.  But believing that this sentiment was not reciprocated by the others, Kon leaves the Kurosaki house in search of a place where he would really belong.  Rukia, meanwhile, questions herself for feeling so comfortable in the real world.\nSource: crunchyroll",
