  "description" : "Kana likes to play with cards and tell people`s fortunes, and lately she is getting good at it! The Ham-Hams are immensely interested and want Oxnard to tell their fortunes, too. Boss thinks it`s all a bunch of hogwash but Oxnard predicts that Boss will meet up with something big, white, and round, and it isn`t long before as foreseen a big, white, round rabbit sits right on top of Boss! The rabbit turns out to be someone`s lost pet. The Ham-Hams, Laura and Kana all join in to help the rabbit find its owner. \nSource: Wikipedia",
