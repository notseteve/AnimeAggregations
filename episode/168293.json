  "description" : "One day, Kanon has a strange dream. All of the Tri-Cool members except her get blown away by her own moves, and for some reason, that makes Kanon anxious. She goes to practice with Tri-Cool as usual, but she`s somewhat out of step with the rest of them. The more she tries to get things back on track, the worse it gets. She feels strange after that, too, while dancing at Green Square or at school.\nSource: crunchyroll",
