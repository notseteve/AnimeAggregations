  "description" : "Rakushun takes Shokei to the border of Ryu and En.  After Shokei lost her parents, she had no idea why she had to suffer so much in poverty, hated by many, but Rakushun teaches her the responsibility to the people, which was missing in Shokei’s family’s administration.  Kei-o, Yoko, goes to live among the people in the kingdom for learning experience, and Rakushun completely believes she will be back on the throne as a better queen.  Shokei wishes she had that kind of care and trust she never had, but Rakushun advises her to move on and start a new life.  Asano also talks to Shoko about how wrong the world is and they start a scheme.\nSource: crunchyroll",
