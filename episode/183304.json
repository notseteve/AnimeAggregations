  "description" : "After being out of touch for so long, Akechi calls the office. Kobayashi complains to him that Hanasaki is acting weird, and Akechi tells him, \"do to him what he did to you.\" Then the Boy Detectives` Club receives an odd request: a death-row prisoner who`s received a death threat has asked specifically for them to guard him when he`s escorted to the district court. Inoue is reluctant, but Kobayashi, thinking that solving this case with Hanasaki will restore things to the way they were, accepts the job for them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
