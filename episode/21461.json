  "description" : "The female chemist who has proposed a new use for volcanic energy, called the \"Active Volcano Guiding System\" at the energy chemists` conference, is named Irena Engel. The name means something to Akira; and he suspects that she could be somehow related to Hans Engel. As feared, the conference venue is suddenly thrown into chaos by an ultrasonic wave beam, and Irena is kidnapped and her research confiscated. The culprit is undoubtedly Hans. He has been planning to threaten the world by converting the new volcano energy use system, developed by his sister Irena, into a missile. Irena grieves over the actions of her brother. But Hans is doggedly determined to take revenge on Dr. Asagumo, who developed Big X, as he believes that his father was killed by the doctor. Hans challenges Akira to a final showdown, expecting to settle old scores at last. Akira, however, tries to persuade Hans not to fight a useless battle. Irena also begs him to return to being the kind brother that he used to be.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
