  "description" : "556 becomes the Keroro Platoon`s guinea pig by volunteering to be turned into a robot. On the upside, he`ll never go hungry again, but one disadvantage is he`s now under Keroro`s (remote) control. Later, Keroro feels guilty after accidentally breaking Aki`s coffee mug, so he goes out to secretly buy a replacement, which leads to getting caught in the rain and taking shelter under an awning with Natsumi for some reason.\nSource: crunchyroll",
