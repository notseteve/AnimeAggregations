  "description" : "As a thank you for helping Ito recover, Tsubakino takes Sakura, Nirei, and Suo to the neon-lit entertainment district of “Keisei Street,” which is full of cozy drinking establishments, mahjong parlors, and bars. The boys are overwhelmed by the atmosphere of this part of town. They head to meet up with Tsubakino when suddenly, a girl in a tattered white dress falls on Sakura. They have no chance to hear the girl’s story before a group of thugs approaches them.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
