  "description" : "Juvia chases Meredy as she carries Zeref before they run into Zancrow, who takes Zeref and cruelly reveals to Meredy that Ultear was responsible for destroying her home. Suddenly, Zeref awakens, utters the name \"Acnologia\", and unleashes a deadly wave of magic that kills Zancrow and knocks out Juvia and Meredy. Overhearing the commotion, Dranbalt warns the rest of the Magic Council troops, who retreat from the island. Meanwhile, Natsu, Lucy, Wendy, Happy, Carla, and Lily regroup with Gray and Erza. The exceeds infiltrate the Grimoire Heart airship to destroy its power source while the others take on Hades directly.
