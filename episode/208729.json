  "description" : "The Bakumatsu, it is an age where idealists struggle passionately for the future of Japan according to their own beliefs. Takasugi Shinsaku, a lucky adventurer from Choshu, tries to sneak onboard one of the ships of the shogunate navy along with his partner, Katsura Kogoro. They are after a legendary treasure said to possess the power to manipulate time called a chronometer. Upon learning that the shogunate is after that power for themselves, Takasugi plots to destroy the device since he believes they shouldn`t be allowed to use boring cheats to maintain their power.\nSource: crunchyroll",
