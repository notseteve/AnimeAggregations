  "description" : "Melmo and Touch, who have turned themselves into adults, are flying a kite on New Year`s Day. They are greeted by a sister and a brother whom they`ve never met before. They ask Melmo and Touch to live in the upscale apartment where they used to live. Melmo and her brothers gladly move into their luxury apartment. But a tempting offer is always deceptive: the sister and brother turn out to be thieves who are sought after by the police. The police break into the apartment, discovers many purses, and try to arrest Melmo and Touch mistaking them for thieves. Melmo and her brothers narrowly escape arrest. \nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
