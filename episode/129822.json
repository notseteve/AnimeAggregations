  "description" : "With the ability to utilize SERN`s LHC to compress memories into D-Mail size, Kurisu completes her time leap machine, capable of sending one`s memories up to two days into the past. However, Rintaro, still disturbed by the threatening texts he has received, decides against using the device, suggesting they instead make their discoveries public. As the lab members decide to have a party, Kurisu comes into conflict with Suzuha, who claims she is destined to become a SERN spy in the future, but Mayuri manages to calm things down between. While a bomb threat is televised, Suzuha, after hearing about the lab`s connection to SERN, flees the lab. Just then, a group of armed men storm the lab led by Moeka, who reveals herself to be a \"Rounder\" hired by SERN. She orders Rintaro, Kurisu, and Daru to be detained before shooting and killing Mayuri, who she deems is not being necessary. \nSource: Wikipedia",
