  "description" : "Yui experiences more chest pains and leaves the mansion in the middle of the night to seek answers from Shu. At first, he is unhelpful but quickly becomes interested in obliging her request for answers by forcibly tasting her blood to verify that it has indeed changed somehow. As she finally gets an answer to the question most prominent on her mind, whether or not her father knowingly sacrificed his daughter to these monsters, that answer becomes irrelevant in so many ways as the awakening is nigh.\nSource: crunchyroll",
