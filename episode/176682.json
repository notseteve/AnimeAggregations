  "description" : "Attacked by the Banshee, Banagher and the Unicorn Gundam are captured and brought aboard the Ra Cailum. Riddhe is surprised to learn that Alberto is Banagher`s older half-brother. Riddhe`s father Ronan has handed Mineva over to Alberto`s aunt Martha, who transfers her aboard the giant airlifter Garuda as a pawn to get Banagher to talk. With no avenue of escape, Banagher still continues to hide the new coordinates to Laplace`s Box. Bright, the commander of Londo Bell, recognizes that Banagher has the same possibilities as previous generations of Gundam pilots and gives him encouragement. Via Kai Shiden, Bright contacts the Garencieres to plan a joint operation to rescue Mineva. As he makes plans to send the Nahel Argama to provide backup, he sends Banagher to the Garuda, where Mineva is being held.\nSource: crunchyroll",
