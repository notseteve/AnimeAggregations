  "description" : "As Himuro looks out over a sunset colored ocean from her room in the resort hotel, Yukimura barges in saying, \"we have to do now what we couldn`t do this afternoon.\" The next day, it`s finally time to make their presentations in front of a huge audience. Kosuke boldly gives his presentation on romantic visual novel games, but one of the professors grills him, asking, \"what purpose does this research serve?\" On the other hand, when Kanade falls into a panicked state just before her presentation, Yukimura hugs her, not realizing that Himuro is watching.\nSource: crunchyroll",
