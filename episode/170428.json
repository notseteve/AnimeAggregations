  "description" : "Beerus and Whis arrive on Kaiou-sama`s planet and detect Gokuu`s presence. While he is initially disappointed that Gokuu does not know what a \"Super Saiyan God\" is, he agrees to test his strength in a sparring match. Gokuu attempts to fight him in all of the Super Saiyan transformations but is outclassed every time. Beerus and Whis head for Earth shortly afterwards while Kaiou-sama uses his telepathy to warn Vegeta ahead of their arrival.\nSource: Wikipedia",
