  "description" : "With the God Key taken from sacred ground the boundaries between godkind and demonkind has begun to crumble. Favaro and Amira continue their way toward Helhiem but detour for a bounty to earn more funds for their journey. Amira recalls \"the incident\" that took one of her wings, leaving her flightless: when she stole the God Key by becoming it. Meanwhile Kaisar gets lost in a forest but is found and taken to Nebelville. Kaisar`s rescuers implore him for his help in dispatching monsters plaguing the town. Kaisar warms to the doctor`s young but serious and distant daughter, Rita, recalling his upbringing as a knight and the disaster that befell his family. Upon confronting the monsters it is revealed that a fog infects victim`s minds to believe an illusion: The village really is rundown and inhabited with zombies. Favaro and Amira show themselves and confront the bounty, the doctor`s daughter, who is a necromancer and has commanded the zombie filled town for the past 200 years.\nSource: Wikipedia",
