  "description" : "An anonymous entity hires Noir to kill a businessman who purportedly killed the husband of a woman whom Mireille sees in a graveyard from time to time. However, Mireille and Kirika discover that the woman and the businessman were hired by a third party to kill them. Mireille and Kirika manage to kill their opponents. Mireille asks the woman to tell her who hired them to take out Noir, but the woman asks Mireille if she would divulge the information under similar circumstances. Back in their apartment, Mireille and Kirika speculate that whoever contracted the hit also created Kirika`s false documents.",
