  "description" : "As the SOS Brigade continues filming, Haruhi tries to give Mikuru another contact lens, ergo another superpower. Yuki quickly takes action and injects her with more nanomachines before any serious damage could be done. After Mikuru is doused in a lake, Tsuruya offers her place as a movie scene. When Kyon notices Mikuru drugged up for a kiss scene with Itsuki, he gets furious about Haruhi`s poor treatment of Mikuru and almost hits her, forcing Itsuki to stop him. As a result, Haruhi becomes depressed, since she always thought Kyon would support her. After hearing Taniguchi`s rude comments, Kyon realizes he is no better and later talks to Haruhi and reinvigorates her. However, Haruhi becomes a little too encouraged as her powers bloom cherry blossoms out of season.",
