  "description" : "With his half of the frozen jewel in hand, Han Unhi has regained his human form and youkai powers. Now, he along with Gessho and Suusu are off to catch up with Setsuyo again to see if they can get the other half, since they stand greater chance of returning Setsuyo`s memories with it. However, according to Rei-chan, Unhi`s servant, the closer the two halves of the jewels get to each other disaster is sure to occur. Undeterred, Unhi heads to the hospital where Setsuyo is recovering only to encounter Fuuki and his nefarious plans.\nSource: crunchyroll",
