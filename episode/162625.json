  "description" : "Several years ago, in an Underground District where citizens rarely get to venture into the sunlight, Levi was part of a band of thieves alongside his partner Farlan, who would use maneuver gear to commit various heists to help each other out. One day, they meet a girl named Isabel, who was chased after by guards for trying to get an injured bird back to the surface, and decide to take her in as one of their group. After a while has passed, a mysterious man from the surface uses a hostage to ensure Levi, Farlan, and Isabel take on a job that would be rewarded with citizenship on the surface. When the three take on the job, they outrun the military police but are caught by the Recon Corps, led by Erwin, who offers to clear Levi and the others of their crimes in exchange for joining the Recon Corps.",
