  "description" : "The world is trying to eliminate Meliodas, who became the new Demon King and became too powerful. Meliodas didn`t tell anyone about the looming deadline. However, the \"Seven Deadly Sins\", including Ban who noticed it, pretend not to notice. If you say it, it`s going to become real. In peace, he works lively at the Boar Hat, but he courageously asked if he couldn`t leave the important \"master\" as it was. And Elizabeth also made her decision without telling anyone.\nSource: TheMovieDB",
