  "description" : "Tsukasa and Isla continue their work, and he finds that despite being a nine-year veteran of Terminal Services she seems to be much more clumsy than might be expected. Their attempts to retrieve an android in the role of a machinist`s apprentice go awry when she startles the android and his owner, and she trips and falls attempting to chase them. He learns that she has not been working in the field like that for some years and thinks that she just needs to get back into her groove. He watches her undergoing training. As such, he attempts to do some of the work of negotiating with the owners of Giftias himself, and sets out writing a manual describing the process. He manages to accomplish the retrieval of the machinist`s android in that way.\nHis colleagues however, know the real reason behind Isla`s quirks: she is very near her end of service as well, and will reach that point in about 2000 more hours.",
