  "description" : "The series begins with a chef named Komatsu discovering a Gourmet Hunter named Toriko, who catches a Pincer Fish, much to Komatsu`s amazement. After Toriko stops an attack on the fish by defeating a Five-Tailed Eagle, he is informed about a local Gararagator and accompanies Komatsu on his journey to the Baron Archipelago, a swamp where the animal lives. While there, Toriko scares off a Baron Tiger. Later, while eating Snake Frogs at dinner, a Swamp Snake suddenly appears but dies because of a large bite wound. However, they discover Baron Leeches on his body and is quickly eaten by the Gararagator, who reveals itself to be an oversized alligator. While fighting the Gararagator, Toriko discovers that it smells the scent of blood from the Baron Leeches. He eventually kills the Gararagator with his Fork and Knife technique. Toriko tells Komatsu of his intention to have a full-course menu while eating the Gararagator, while Komatsu tells his dream of becoming a world-renowned chef. Komatsu offers to come with Toriko, which he accepts.\nSource: Wikipedia",
