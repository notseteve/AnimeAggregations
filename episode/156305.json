  "description" : "Sarah announces that Leon`s sales have not fallen despite the opening of the Amada store nearby, as their salaries are paid. This is Fino`s first salary and Raul says that she should buy something memorable with it. She convinces him to come with her as she goes shopping, and she winds up buying a lot of strange things and spends all her money before he realises it. She gives him a small charm with the hair of a hero who nearly defeated the demon lord as a gift.\nAs they are heading home and Raul goes off to buy some drinks at a vending machine, he hears Fino being attacked, but her assailants run off as he runs toward them. She tells him that they told her to become the demon lord, and change the world back into one that needs heroes.",
