  "description" : "One day, in the midst of practices for the athletic festival, Erika finds out that Komichi is going to dance at the festival`s after-party. She starts to imagine what would happen if she played the piano accompaniment for Komichi`s dance, but she keeps it to herself. Meanwhile, Komichi is practicing hard at volleyball, but depite the fact that it`s a major team event, their teamwork is somewhat lacking. When Touko comments that it`d be nice if they could find a place where everyone could practice together, Komichi remembers her previous school, Futaba Elementary.\nSource: crunchyroll",
