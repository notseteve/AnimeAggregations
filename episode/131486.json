  "description" : "Since Meo used the phone at Hanamaru’s to call her dad’s cell, the yakuza now knows where she is. Some of Mikawa’s men go roughen Min and her ramen joint up a bit in an attempt to convince her to hand the Thai girl over, but Min’s one tough cookie. Meo overhears the struggle and decides to run away and handle things on her own.  Unfortunately, things don’t go well for Meo and it’s up to Narumi and the Hirasaka Gang to rescue her. Narumi realizes that the only way he’ll be able to truly help Meo and her father is to join the Hirasaka brotherhood. Although the Fourth isn’t willing to accept Narumi into his gang, he is willing to welcome him into the family.  Now that Narumi has a strong ally behind him, he’s willing to take some dangerous risks. But will his outrageous plan be enough to trick the yakuza and rescue Meo’s dad?",
