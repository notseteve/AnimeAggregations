  "description" : "After the match with Team Y, Isagi`s rank moved up, and he became the center of the team. The next match is against Team W, led by the Wanima twins. Their eye contact and impeccable combinations are hard to beat. They used to play in the same team as Chigiri Hyoma, and they use his past trauma to egg him on. Chigiri says that he joined Blue Lock to find a reason to quit soccer. Team Z leads the game with Kuon`s play. Everyone`s elated for the good start of the match, but Isagi feels something is off.\nSource: crunchyroll",
