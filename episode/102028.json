  "description" : "As the battle commences, back at the Vatican Enrico Maxwell, the head of Section XIII Iscariot is given a major promotion, and with it he begins to mobilize the Vatican`s fighters. Meanwhile, in the heart of London, while Integra is busy convincing the Iscariot members to escort her home, the Hellsing Mansion is under siege by Zorin Blitz and her forces. The only line of defense against this assault are Captain Bernadotte, his Wild Geese, and Seras. As the battle wages on, they must deal with not only the vampire Nazi forces strength, but Zorin`s mysterious powers of illusion that almost destroys the Geese from within. The quick thinking of Seras frees them from Zorin`s grip, but the battle is not over. After an attempted stolen kiss, the group splits up, Seras in one direction and the Geese in another, but not before promising each other they`ll come out of this alive.",
