  "description" : "Orihime and Uryu, dressed as Soul Reapers, are met by members of Squad 12 who offer to help them, but Uryu quickly realizes that it is a trap. Squad 12`s Captain Kurotsuchi presents himself to Orihime and Uryu, criticizing Uryu as a Quincy who has no chance of winning this fight.  Uryu orders one of the remaining members of Squad 11 in the area to take Orihime and run away, acknowledging the fact that Kurotusuchi is more interested in her than a mere Quincy.  As their fight progresses, Kurotsuchi`s actions and words become increasingly more provocative and infuriating to Uryu.\nSource: crunchyroll",
