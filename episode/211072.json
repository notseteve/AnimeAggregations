  "description" : "Subaru and his editor, Kawase, plan to have their next meeting at Subaru`s house. When the cat-loving Kawase sees Haru for the first time, he can`t restrain his excitement as he chases her around to play with her. Meanwhile, Haru has been behaving strangely, staring at nothing and suddenly leaping around the room for no apparent reason. On top of that, she makes a mess of Subaru`s parents` room, which he hadn`t entered in a long time, and ends up covered in dust. Subaru has just about had enough... but then he discovers the albums in the dusty room.\nSource: crunchyroll",
