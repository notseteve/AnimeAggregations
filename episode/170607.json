  "description" : "All of the Fairy Tail members are flash-frozen, possibly dead, within the giant Tartaros prison called Plutogrim... except for Lucy, who seems to have escaped that fate through luck alone. But that luck seems to have run out as she`s pursued through the prison by the members of Tartaros, including the Nine Demon Gates! So it`s a good thing she can always count on her friends, the Celestial Spirits!\nSource: crunchyroll",
