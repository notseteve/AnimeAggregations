  "description" : "After removing Junketsu, Ryuko reunites with Senketsu and battles Nui, during which she recovers both Scissor Blades and cuts off Nui`s arms, disarming her. Nui is rescued by Ragyo`s secretary, Rei Hououmaru, while the Elite Four and Nudist Beach take advantage of the Covers used for her escape to recover their allies and Life Fibers. Afterwards, Satsuki offers to let Ryuko punch her in penance for manipulating her, but the Elite Four stand in the way of her blows. Recognizing that Satsuki has friends supporting her like her own, Ryuko accepts her sister`s apology and accepts to fight alongside her. After a reconciliatory celebration, Satsuki explains Ragyo`s plan to transmit the original Life Fiber`s signal across Earth, absorbing all human beings into a massive Life Fiber cocoon to cover the planet. Ryuko and Satsuki head off together to face Ragyo, while Mako, equipped with a new Goku Uniform, stays behind with the others to defend the Naked Sol from giant-sized Covers.",
