  "description" : "The City of Steam, Whitechurch. Hank and his party head there in order to find Cain Madhouse, the man who unleashed the Beasts into this world. According to Liza’s intel, he appears to be killing random people in the slums there. Hank and Schaal go to investigate why these murders are happening, when another body shows up. After seeing the claw marks on the newest body, Hank determines that it wasn’t the work of Cain. A witness appears before them and tells them that he saw a demon statue murder the victim, which confirms Hank’s suspicions on who is behind the murders.\nSource: crunchyroll",
