  "description" : "Reiji and Noela go to buy lunch at the nearby Rabbit Tavern. Noela loves the Rabbit Tavern`s food and is excited to eat. Suddenly, they hear shouting coming from inside the restaurant. They cautiously look inside and discover the Rabbit Tavern`s owner and poster girl Rena having an argument with the owner of a recently established rival restaurant. Not only has this restaurant stolen their customers, but it is apparently plotting to buy out the Rabbit Tavern as well. Seeing Rena`s sadness, Reiji wishes he had some way to help the Rabbit Tavern.\nSource: crunchyroll",
