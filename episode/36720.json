  "description" : "Takemoto, Hagu, Morita, Mayama, Yamada, and Professor Hanamoto go to the zoo. Professor Hanamoto talks to Mayama and tells him about Rika`s husband. Professor Hanamoto lived with Rika her husband, and was very close to both of them. When Rika`s husband died in an accident, Professor Hanamoto took care of Rika, as she suffered major injuries in the accident. Professor Hanamoto also tells Mayama that Rika is hiring someone to replace Mayama. This is because Rika believes Mayama will get the job he applied for, but it is also because she has feelings for him, and it is too painful to have him around her. Later, Yamada decides to stay at the school as a graduate student. Mayama is notified that he has received a job at the place he applied to. Takemoto, Hagu, Morita, Mayama, Yamada, and Professor Hanamoto have a party to celebrate. Mayama carries a drunken Yamada home on his back and tells her that he thought she would leave if he turned her down. Yamada begins crying and tells him she loves him.\nSource: Wikipedia",
