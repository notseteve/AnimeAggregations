  "description" : "As Oubu finally achieves its complete form, Entei stands before it controlled not by Reoko, but by Zetsubi. Laughing boldly, she tells the shocked Azuma that he can`t beat Entei, but Kinoa insists that they and Oubu are different from before. Zetsubi is cornered by Oubu`s ferocious attack, so she takes the Russian team`s Bubuki to use as Entei`s limbs, and Oubu is overwhelmed again. Can Azuma and his party win this fight?\nSource: crunchyroll",
