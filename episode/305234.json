  "description" : "Having overcome their trial, \"Albaz\" and \"Ecclesia\" are accepted as comrades by the Springans.\nHowever, their joy is short-lived. The earth suddenly trembles, and the monstrous \"Supreme Sovereign Serpent of Golgonda\", appears.\nThe Springans and Ecclesia are shaken by the towering creature that dominates the horizon.\nThen, the branded energy emitted from Golgonda`s \"Hole\" causes Albaz`s power to spiral out of control.\nAbsorbing the Hole`s power, he transforms into \"Albion\", a crimson dragon engulfed in flames.\nFrenzied by each other`s overwhelming power, Albion and Golgonda throw themselves into battle, dragging everyone nearby into the fray.\nTo stop Albaz, Ecclesia rushes forward, heedless of the danger.\nAmid the flames of battle, the dragon and the girl meet once more.\nTheir bond now unfolds a new chapter in the story.\nSource: Official English Website",
