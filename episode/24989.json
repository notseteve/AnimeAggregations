  "description" : "It`s the morning after Ichigo`s transformation into a Soul Reaper, and no one in his family has any recollection of the events.  Even the memory of him slaying a hollow is forgotten.  He heads off to school, where he finds Rukia in the awkward guise of a transfer student. Now that Ichigo has taken most of her Soul Reaper powers, she orders him to take her place until she is at full strength. Ichigo dismisses her request, just as a mysterious shadow begins to follow Orihime Inoue, a jovial classmate of Ichigo with a sad past.\nSource: crunchyroll",
