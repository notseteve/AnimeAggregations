  "description" : "Sawamura gets himself into a baseball match against the 12th grade batter, Kiyokuni Azuma. Sawamura forms a battery with Kazuya Miyuki, the catcher carrying high hopes for Seidou. Sawamura loses confidence against Azuma, an opponent he`s never faced, but Miyuki`s lead slowly pulls out Sawamura`s full potential. And then he throws his last pitch. After returning from Tokyo, Sawamaura is lost about his future, unable to forget his pitching with Miyuki. He wants to test his strength in Tokyo, but he can`t betray his junior high teammates and leave them behind. Bewildered, his teammates approach him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
