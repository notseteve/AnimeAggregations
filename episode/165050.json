  "description" : "The \"Marshmaro\" characters are visible to us, but not to the people in the BonKoi world. They come in various forms, with various personalities. The scripts call them \"Maro (type).\" In this episode, Sayuri, Ryou, Mitsuki, Gilbert, and Yoshinosuke have been taken over by the Marshmaros. Enjoy a BonKoi that`s a bit different from the usual!\nSource: crunchyroll",
