  "description" : "After Shiki appeared and said he will listen to what they have to say, Hoshitani can`t help feeling somewhat nervous. He worries that his rudeness towards Shiki, when he didn`t know who he was, will count against them. However, when Hoshitani consults with an old friend, he receives some surprising advice. Meanwhile, Shiki holds true to his promise to consider expanding the number of performers for Opening Ceremony. A meeting between the five members of the Kao Council takes place to discuss the matter.\nSource: crunchyroll",
