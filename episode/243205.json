After Iroha and Yachiyo reunite, they meet up with Madoka and the other girls, but are confronted by Tsuruno Yui and Mami Tomoe who have become soldiers of the Magius. Mami and Tsuruno, who are being manipulated by another entity, begin attacking the Magical Girls. Iroha and Madoka are in a bind as they are unable to fight back. As a tactic, the Magius summon countless witches to gather in Kamihama City. The largest ever Supercell is approaching and will hit Kamihama City in six hours. The true identity of the Supercell is actually Walpurgisnacht, the most sinister and evil witch ever.\nSource: Funimation",
