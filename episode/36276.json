  "description" : "It is late summer. Takemoto, Mayama, and Morita are coming back from an evening bath when Takemoto receives a phone call from Hagu inviting them all over for dinner the next evening. Mayama and Morita decide not to go, leaving Takemoto to have dinner with Hagu and Professor Hanamoto. Meanwhile, Mayama has developed feelings for Rika Harada, an older woman who is good friends with Professor Hanamoto, and is also Mayama`s boss. Ayumi Yamada, a friend of Mayama who has a crush on him, finds out about this and publicly chastises him for it. Later, Yamada approaches Mayama and asks why he works for Rika without mentioning his feelings for Rika. However, Mayama coldly tells Yamada that she should find another guy. Yamada is deeply hurt and cries about it to Morita.\nSource: Wikipedia",
