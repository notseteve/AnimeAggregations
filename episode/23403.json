  "description" : "While on vacation, Black Jack comes across a young man haunted by the vision of a woman who beckons him to return to a town he’s never visited. He also has visions of being shot in a battle in which he was too young to have possibly fought! Bullet wounds mysteriously appear on his body, bleed, and disappear. Is the young man insane? Could it have anything to do with an operation performed on the young man many years before? Or are there other forces at work? It’s up to Black Jack.\nSource: tezukainenglish.com",
