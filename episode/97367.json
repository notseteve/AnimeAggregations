  "description" : "The next battle is between the 17th and the 10th platoons, and the commander of the 10th platoon, Dinn Dee, seems to have bad blood against Sharnid since he had once belonged to the 10th and had abandoned them in the middle of a battle for reasons that remain unclear.\nAs Felli and Layfon return after dinner with the platoon, Naruki suddenly appears and calls him off for an emergency. A group of outsiders posing as students has been caught peddling the illegal drug known as Overload, which accelerates the user`s kei flow, but it is prohibited because of its dangerous side effects. The pedlars are trapped in a building, and they make their move, making an explosion they hope to distract the police from their escape, but Layfon sees through the ruse and is attacked by a swordsman. Nina is startled by the explosion and runs to the scene, where she is herself attacked by a woman wielding a bow, who prevents her from getting closer. Sharnid, while following after his former friend in the 10th Platoon, Dalchena, stumbles onto the scene himself, where she confronts him.\nThe swordsman Layfon encounters introduces himself as Haia Salinban Lyia, a member of the Salinban Mercenary group. He says that he isn`t one of the drug traffickers but only accompanied them because that was the only way he could reach Zuellni. Haia proves exceptionally skilled, managing to break Layfon`s dite, and escapes.",
