  "description" : "#1 Today is a story everyone knows: \"Little Red Riding Hood.\"  However, for some reason Mom has the role of Red Riding Hood and Fumi is playing the mother.  #2 Fumi has come over to Kanna`s house and Kanna`s mom`s homemade scones have her in a daze.  She pesters Mom, \"Next time, we should have fantastic homemade snacks too,\" but...  #3 Bunji arrives at school to find that Chinatsu`s and his names are scribbled on the blackboard, sharing an umbrella. Being surrounded by jeers of \"Married! Married!\" Bunji becomes overly conscious of Chinatsu and becomes unable to speak to her.  #4 Bunji has gotten a 0 on his test. Mom treats Bunji to a deluxe icecream figuring, \"It`s a rare thing so we might as well celebrate it!\"  As she watches Bunji happily eat, she recalls memories of days long past.\nSource: crunchyroll",
