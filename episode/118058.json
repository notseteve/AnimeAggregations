  "description" : "Bunji, Ma, Chi, Daichi, and Kenta, the five idiots, focus on training for the following day`s athletic meet. They mean no ill will, but the group keeps acting as one... The Kamohara household is super excited the night before the athletic meet, because Bunji was told he has been chosen for the relay race. The truth is he was chosen by random lottery, but they`re so excited he can`t bring himself to say... The morning of the meet. Dad, being a professional cameraman, stands by at the gate to get the best possible vantage point. The rival fathers coerce him, however. Ball throwing, ball rolling, and lunchtime all pass. It is finally time for the relay race. Bunji has butterflies in his stomach when Ma shows up to cheer him on.\nSource: crunchyroll",
