  "description" : "While Amu is working on her homework, she gets a call from Yukari. As she is sick with a cold, Amu must be Utau`s manager for the day. Utau was more recognized in Easter, but ever since quitting, she has lost her popularity. Sanjou Productions is not yet recognized. The two look for a studio to help debut Utau`s latest single, but don`t have much luck. They stop at a fountain after searching and talk about Ikuto. Utau is confident that she is the one for him. An X egg appears and Amu goes off to purify it. Two more come out and hatch, and Utau transforms with El and purifies them. Utau then sings her new song, \"Heartful Song\", for a group of people by the fountain.\nSource: crunchyroll",
