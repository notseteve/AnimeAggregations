  "description" : "Midge and the others set course for Planet Loca to return Jose and Claudia to their home planet. While the planet itself is a hostile environment, the plant dome where the couple lives is supposed to be lush and green and full of butterflies, but when they finally get inside, all life in the dome seems to have withered away. Midge manages to find a lone survivor, Prince Sulkosky, the leader of the butterflies and a friend of Jose and Claudia. When the prince awakens he tells the others about what happened and how he believes a material he found by the dome`s guardian tree, the Mother Tree, is responsible. However, when Doc and Midge seek to investigate the material and the tree, Sulkosky demands that they not do so, since the tree and anything related to it is sacred and dangerous.\nSource: crunchyroll",
