  "description" : "Giant Taros wakes from a long sleep. In fact, Poseidon awakens him to destroy Triton. Taros is the guardian angel of penguins, not a member of the Poseidon Family. However, he owes his revival to Poseidon, and has to pay back the debt. So he reluctantly stands in the way of Triton and his friends, who are heading for the Atlantic Ocean. During the fight, Pipi and Fin are taken away by Leharl.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
