  "description" : "The Supernatural Research Club is trying to find the second volume of the notebooks left by their predecessors which describe the other witches. It is supposedly in a locked storage room kept by the teacher who is conducting the supplementary lessons, which Yamada has to take along with a few others, including a very shy and soft-spoken girl named Otsuka. Yamada swaps bodies with Shiraishi, and after his performance seems to markedly improve Otsuka kisses \"him\". This leads Shiraishi to suspect that Otsuka is yet another witch, so she has Otsuka kiss Yamada again when he is in his own body. Her power turns out to be telepathy, and by incorporating Miyamura into their telepathic network they manage to pass the supplementary exams and obtain the key.\nThey find that the storage room was cleaned out long ago and no trace of the second notebook is found. They try to figure out who had the room cleaned.",
