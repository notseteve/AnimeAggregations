  "description" : "While Orihime is watching Ichigo and Ulquiorra’s battle from the sidelines, Loly and Menoly appear before her. They learned that Orihime is no longer of any use to Aizen, and they want to seize this opportunity to defeat her. Orihime has no means to fight back, and she gets hurt left and right. When Ichigo notices this, he tries to go rescue her, but Ulquiorra keeps getting in his way, and he is unable to get anywhere near Orihime. Amidst the chaos, a new enemy breaks through the floor of the Fifth Tower and appears before Ichigo and the others. The new enemy is none other than Yammy who came to assist Ulquiorra.\nSource: crunchyroll",
