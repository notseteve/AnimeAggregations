  "description" : "When Nagi went into the onsen, she had a drunk-like behavior which was probably due to the affect of the onsen. Hayate went to save her but despite the fact she was naked, Hayate had a very calm demeanor which upset Nagi. She met an alien and from a far distant, something came towards them. Nagi was helping the alien find Maya, the spaceship when something happened…On other matters, Hinagiku and Nishizawa-san were developing a deeper relationship at the onsen. We’ll fully understand the real reason why Nagi went to Shimoda which will conclude this Izu-Shimoda episode!\nSource: crunchyroll",
