  "description" : "A girl is falling from the sky, head down; yet she isn`t scared. A bird tries to hold her with his beak; she calmly tells him that this is of no use. Then suddenly, the clouds open and she can see the ground getting nearer... Finally, the girl awakes from this strange dream, finding herself in a new world where she has to face a lot of questions and some uncomfortable experiences, ending up with her getting two gray wings on her aching back, a halo, and a name.",
