Coincidentally, Professor Cerise wants our heroes to research a Pikachu outbreak, so they’re off! When they arrive, Goh catches a female Pikachu, whose friends are digging Thunder Stones out of the nearby rocks. But Team Rocket arrives, and they manage to round up not just the wild Pikachu, but Ash’s Pikachu, too! Goh’s Pikachu knows just what to do, using a Thunder Stone to evolve into Raichu to rescue its Pikachu friends—who launch a massive Thunderbolt, sending Team Rocket packing!\nSource: Official Website",
