  "description" : "As the Covers start to capture citizens, including Mako, using their life force to power themselves, Satsuki triggers an explosion to destroy the stadium, allowing the Elite Four and Nudist Beach to escape. In the chaos, Senketsu manages to stay conscious long enough to get the unconscious Ryuko and her Scissor Blade to Mikisugi. One month later, the Elite Four have joined up with Nudist Beach to fight against the Covers as they take over Japan, while Ryuko has remained in a coma since the battle. Meanwhile, Satsuki is held captive by Ragyo, who explains that her father, Soichiro, had faked his own death and disguised himself as Isshin in order to raise Ryuko and prepare his revenge against her. The Elite Four soon fight with the Covers, using a new device to rescue Mako from her imprisonment. When the Covers start to use disruptive noises in defense, Ryuko awakens from her slumber, destroying the Covers and rescuing the prisoners with one strike. Thinking that she is an inhuman monster, Ryuko vows that she will never put Senketsu on again.",
