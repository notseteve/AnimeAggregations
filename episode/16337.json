  "description" : "In flashback, Nae arranges a signal with Yuta if he wants to meet her in the Red Valley on the day he is to depart. Eijiro leaves the signal to test Nae`s loyalty to him. When Nae goes to the Red Valley, Eijiro kills her. Eijiro thinks he can revive Nae with mermaid ash. He cannot find it, however, because Nae hid the remaining ash to keep her father from finding out that she used it to make the Red Valley. Eijiro looks for the ash for decades and finally finds it, using it to revive Nae`s still pristine corpse in the Red Valley. In the present, Yuta and Sokichi escape Eijiro`s men. Nae leads Mana to the Red Valley, but Eijiro intercepts them. When Nae and Mana try to proceed to the Red Valley, Eijiro draws a knife and stabs Nae, critically wounding her. Nae arrives in the Red Valley and remembers that Eijiro killed her there. When Yuta arrives and goes to Nae, she dies from her wound. As they leave, Yuta asks Mana if it`s jealousy that makes her impatient with him. Mana asks Yuta if jealousy is some kind of dessert.\nSource: Wiki",
