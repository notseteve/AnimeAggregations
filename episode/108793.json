Natsu and Happy inadvertently save Lucy after approaching Bora, mistaking \"Salamander\" for the fire dragon. Later, Bora offers membership of Fairy Tail to Lucy and invites her onto his yacht, where he reveals his plan to smuggle her and other young girls. Natsu and Happy rescue Lucy again and expose Bora as an imposter. Revealing himself to be the real Salamander, Natsu easily defeats Bora with his mastery over fire magic and invites Lucy to join Fairy Tail, which she accepts as they flee from the army.",
