  "description" : "Eggman comes in to the area disturbing the peace, but he`s no match for the blue blur. However, when Sonic is fighting, some sort of computer chip lands in Sonic`s ear, causing him to pick his ears for the rest of the day (which Amy hates!). When a remote is pressed, Sonic goes berserk, and then begins to run fast and uncontrollably into the desert. The gang has to come up with ways to stop him, with the assist from Knuckles and Sam, but to their luck, they all fail, and Sam is no help either. What will they do?",
