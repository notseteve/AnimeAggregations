  "description" : "As Madoka rushes to fight against the enemy Ovid to protect her town, Lan becomes conflicted about a legend Madoka doesn`t know of, the fear of which prevents her from being able to pilot her own Vox Lympha. As the enemy, Kirius, tries to ask Madoka to come to her planet, she refuses and the fight resumes. Feeling Madoka is in danger, Lan overcomes her fear and pilots the Lympha, but finds herself up against Izo. As Lan expresses her guilt towards dragging Madoka into this, Madoka lifts her spirits, enabling her to overcome her fears and transform Lympha into its fighter mode, allowing her to come to Madoka`s aid, forcing the enemy to retreat. Afterwards, Madoka and Lan decide to name their Vox units Midori and Orca respectively.\nSource: Wikipedia",
