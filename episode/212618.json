  "description" : "The man who was killed by Mista at the airport, Carne, was first able to activate his stand, Notorious Chase, after he died. Notorious Chase reacts to movement and it attacks Giorno, resulting in him losing both arms. This makes him unable to use Golden Wind’s abilities, but he gives life to his brooch and recreates his left hand. Trish decides that she’s going to protect that left hand and goes after the brooch, but she’s detected. When all seemed lost, Trish’s Stand, Spicy Lady, was activated.\nSource: crunchyroll",
