  "description" : "The lord of a poor province is sad to see how weak his sumo wrestlers are for this year`s tournament, but they all defeat even the strongest wrestlers. A fava bean, a piece of straw, and a piece of charcoal all bounce out of an old woman`s kitchen and decide to visit Ise. There are two men who live on the east and west side of town, and each night they come to a bar to drink.  They always drink the same drink, and insult each other.\nSource: crunchyroll",
