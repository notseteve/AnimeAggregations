  "description" : "While Seras is successfully overcoming Zorin`s soldiers, Bernadotte and his forces are being slaughtered. Seras comes to their rescue, and destroys most of Zorin`s forces. Zorin then delves deep into Seras` memories, forcing her to relive her painful childhood, as she had to watch her parents be murdered by gangsters and her mother`s corpse being raped. While Seras is trapped in the illusion, Zorin hacks off her arm, stabs her through the back, and cuts her eyes. Bernadotte tries to escape with the badly wounded Seras, but Zorin stabs him through the back. He kisses Seras in his agony, then tells her to bite him. Tearfully, she does so, healing most of her wounds except her left arm, which spews shadow matter. Seras destroys all of Zorin`s forces, then attacks and kills Zorin. Seras then leaves the mansion and heads off to destroy the remaining vampires and ghouls in the city, as Vatican forces loom in the horizon. OVA 6 feature a drama CD of Crossfire.",
