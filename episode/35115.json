  "description" : "Humans abound on the earth. As their numbers increase, however, they begin to speak blasphemy against God and become corrupted. God decides to cleanse the ground with a deluge as punishment. So he orders Noah to construct an ark and put one pair of every creature on board. Although he is laughed at by those who do not believe in God, Noah works hard to make a huge ark, and puts the animals in it. Then the great deluge hits.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
