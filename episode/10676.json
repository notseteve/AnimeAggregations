  "description" : "With Cherubimon defeated, the Digidestined are happier than ever. However, they soon become confused as the Digital World has not been repaired. As they try to sort things out, they arrive at a large tunnel entrance where they meet Baromon. The kids immediately evolve to fight him but Baromon wishes them no harm. Baromon leads everyone into the Tunnel of Time, where the Digital World`s history is kept. Baromon tells them of Lucemon`s treachery and how he was sealed away into a realm of nothingness. Bitter, Lucemon wanted the Digital World destroyed so he tainted Cherubimon to do the work for him. Baromon foresees that if the destruction is carried out, Lucemon will be revived and it will mean the apocalypse. He tells the kids that they must go back to the real world before it is too late.\nSource: crunchyroll",
