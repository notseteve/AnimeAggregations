  "description" : "Zeppeli recalls how Tonpetty foretold where his death would take place; in the very place he is in right now. Knowing this, Zeppeli fights against Tarkus with the intention of finding a way to free JoJo. However, Tarkus ensnares him with a chain and rips his body into two. Using the last of his strength, Zeppeli transfers the last of his Ripple energy to JoJo, allowing him to heal his injuries, break free from his chains, and obliterate Tarkus. Following the battle, Zeppeli tells JoJo that he has accepted his fate and has passed his will onto him before passing away. As JoJo, Speedwagon, and Poco make their way back to Windknights Lot, they meet Tonpetty, along with his other students, Dire and Straizo. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Poco`s sister, Peggy, has been kidnapped by Dio.",
