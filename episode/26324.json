  "description" : "The Minerva crew find an Earth Forces fleet waiting for them outside Orb`s territorial waters, leaving them no choice but to somehow break through the enemy lines. While Rey and Lunamaria guard the ship, Shinn fights an aerial battle against the Earth Forces mobile suits, but the tide turns against them as the enemy deploys a huge mobile armor whose positron deflector shield can withstand even the Minerva`s Tannhauser cannon.\nSource: crunchyroll",
