  "description" : "Seita was picking pockets to see Hinowa, the highest-ranked 遊女/Yujo (courtesans/ prostitute) in the underground 遊郭/Yukaku (Licensed Quarters) Yoshiwara Tougenkyo, where law has no meaning. But his picking act was all for the sake of seeing the mother he was separated from at a young age. To let Seita see Hinowa, Gintoki and the gang march into Yoshiwara Tougenkyo, where they receive a rough welcome by Tsukuyo – the head of Yoshiwara’s paramilitary force, “Hyakka.”\nSource: crunchyroll",
