  "description" : "Wakana felt relieved just for a moment after they got all of the materials they needed for Marin`s cosplay, but then he`s shocked to find out that he needs to finish the cosplay in two weeks. On top of that, his grandfather, Kaoru, hurts his back, so Wakana has to run the shop and he also has midterms. Wakana feels overwhelmed and gets depressed, wondering if he`ll ever actually become a kashirashi at this point.\nSource: crunchyroll",
