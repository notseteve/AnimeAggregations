  "description" : "Solomon`s kingdom Jerusalem falls to the attack of enemies. The people of Israel are expelled from their country and again become wandering tribes with no place to go. The Hebrews, the people of Israel, are captured in Babylon and are forced to migrate as slaves. Ezekiel keeps some precious scrolls of the Hebrew history with him. He believes that someday his people will enjoy God`s love again. The people of Israel regret their acts against God, and they once again go back to living faithfully in his eyes.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
