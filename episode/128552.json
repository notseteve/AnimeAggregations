  "description" : "Riko gives Kinji an arcade ticket so he goes to the arcade for a little relaxation. He plays the UFO catcher and manages to get two stuffed toys for Aria. The next day, Kinji once again misses the bus to school, but the Butei Killer has struck once again, and planted bombs in the bus, set to explode if the bus slows down below a certain point. This becomes Kinji`s first mission with Aria. They manage to destroy an remotely-operated car that is shooting the bus with a mounted gun, and board the bus, trying to find and defuse the bomb. Aria sees the bomb planted on the bus chassis, but is unable to reach it. Kinji tries to find the sensors that the Killer is using to know what is going on, but a second car appears and shoots at them, and would have killed him if Aria did not intervene. She is wounded as a result. The sniper Reki, on a helicopter, manages to shoot the bomb off the bus. Aria is disappointed with Kinji`s performance in the mission and decides that he isn`t the partner for her.",
