  "description" : "Miyuki’s team in the Tokyo Invitational is having trouble batting against Wynd Youth’s left-handed pitcher Conrad. The American team has the lead going into the seventh inning, when Narumiya finally takes the mound. Meanwhile, Furuya and Ono have formed a battery to take on Yamamori. Ono is quietly eager to help Furuya pitch the way he’s used to, even without Miyuki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
