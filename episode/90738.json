  "description" : "A father and son pair of foxes come to pay Kuugen a visit, and ask for her help because their home in the mountains has been destroyed by humans. Kuugen asks Noboru to allow them to stay for a while. As the two lack names, She names the baby fox \"Daigoro\", and the father by implication is named \"Ogami Ittō\". Later Ogami helps Kou in her battle against a Clam Spirit who is targeting Tōru. The gatekeepers from Ebisu`s shrine show up to claim the clam. It is explained that the clam is on the run from the neighboring area`s deity, Mubyōu, from whom it had stolen a treasured artifact. The reward promised by the famously violent Mubyōu for the return of the clam is the spiritual rights to a piece of land. Kuugen and Noboru manage to blackmail the gatekeeper spirits into letting Ogami keep the clam, and thus Ogami gains a home for himself and Daigoro from Mubyōu.\nSource: crunchyroll",
