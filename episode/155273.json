  "description" : "The city has been struck by a heat wave, and the air conditioning at Leon has failed, and Raul and Fino arrive at the store to find that Nova has collapsed from heat exhaustion. They try to help her, and Raul is found in a compromising situation as Sarah and Visor arrive.\nWhile Lore attempts to repair the air conditioning the store conducts a summer sale with the staff dressed in swimsuits. This becomes wildly successful, and after their work shifts Elsa, Ram, and even Airi are encouraged to participate.\nAs the day ends the son-in-law to whom they had sold an air conditioning unit comes by and tells Raul how he is a journalist for an important business newspaper and that he has written an article praising the excellent service that he received from them the other day. Amada`s upper management has also seen the article and calls in the manager of the capital shop near Leon and admonishes him for failing to destroy them.",
