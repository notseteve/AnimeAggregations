  "description" : "Villar`s Mage Leader, Margaret, is about to turn 25. Villar only employs female mages, and when they reach the age of 25, he has their contracts voided. A lavish party is thrown. All in attendance express their gratitude to Margaret, as well as their sorrow at having to bid her farewell. It is then that Villar takes her hand and asks her to dance. Siluca looks on with growing frustration as they dance passionately, almost flaunting their mutual feelings for each other.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
