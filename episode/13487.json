  "description" : "With only a 3-hour window remaining to save Athena, the saints are feeling the pressure. They enter the tenth house, the house of Capricorn, and find it vacant. They pass through to the other side safely, but all of a sudden, the ground cracks creating a large gap in the earth. Seiya, Hyoga and Shun end up on the side away from the house (close to the eleventh house), but Shiryu is stuck on the side near the exit of the house of Capricorn. Then, Shura the gold saint of Capricorn emerges from the house and a fight with Shiryu ensues. Unable to help their friend by the distance between them, the saints realise they must move on to the eleventh house, as their need to save Athena is great. We discover that Shura is the most loyal of all the gold saints to Athena, and he is the one who killed Aioros those many years ago, because he thought Aioros was the one who tried to kill Athena when she was a baby, Shura punishes Shiryu and has him near deaths door, when suddenly, Shiryu is spirityally guided by his mentor in China. With his mentor’s help, Shiryu realises Shura’s weak link and he exposes it to his advantage.\nSource: crunchyroll",
