  "description" : "Gintoki finds himself forced into looking after Sadaharu and is soon exhausted. That’s when Katsura shows up with a peculiar creature. Seems this thing is a gift from the space merchant Sakamoto and is called Elizabeth. Gintoki is surprised at the fact that Katsura, who supposedly hates space creatures, would keep such a pet. Then Gintoki and the gang learn that a TV show is looking for weird animals to appear on their show. Blinded by the grand prize given to the winner, Gintoki and the gang decide to participate.\nSource: crunchyroll",
