  "description" : "With only four remaining to save Athena, Tatsumi and the other bronze saints protecting her are beginning to worry about losing her. Tatsumi sent Saint Geki the bear to bring Athena’s sceptre to her side, and as it is placed in her hand, something magical happens. The gold saints’ armour of Sagittarius arrives in the sanctuary, reuniting all of the gold armour for the first time in thirteen years. All of the remaining gold saints come together as their armour begins to ring out like old friends greeting one another. Pope Arles is pleased that he has all of the gold saints’ armour in the Sanctuary, but he is worried that something might still go wrong, especially since the bronze saints have made it through the ninth house and are only two away from him. As qickly as the Sagittarius armour appeared, it just as quickly flew through the sky int the house of Sagittarius. Inside, Seiya and Shiryu are waiting.. Once they near the gold armour, it begins to move on its own. It points its Sagittarius arrow at Seiya and without warning fires at him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
