  "description" : "The Vongola rings have a hidden power… Just as Mammon says, when the seven rings are gathered, a flame appears from the rings that can melt the ice of the Zero Point Breakthrough. The ring grants great power to the proper heir, the Blood of the Vongola. The flames free Xanxus, and Xanxus gets ahold of the ring. Tsuna has used up his energy in the battle and is unable to stop him. Gokudera and the others rush over, but they are too late. The rings that Xanxus wears begin to shine and fill with power!\nSource: crunchyroll",
