Hibari uses his Cloud Hedgehog to hold up the enemy, and Gokudera and Squalo back him up. Right when Dino is using his whole body to try to stop Byakuran, Mukuro from ten years in the future arrives, having used Real Illusions and wielding Chrome’s trident! The future Mukuro resists Byakuran with his powerful illusions. Mukuro says many puzzling things to Tsuna, including an order to never hand the Sky Arcobaleno, Yuni, over to Byakuran.\nSource: crunchyroll",
