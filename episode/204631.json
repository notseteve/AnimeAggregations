  "description" : "The Izumo-ya currently bears a significant debt inherited from Seiji`s father and it is due for repayment. Seiji beseeches the man who holds their debt and, in honor of Seiji`s late father, he grants a one month extension. The man even suggests that Seiji consider selling some of the items in the lending shop, but Seiji turns it down. Though the debt is great, Seiji tries to come up with an alternative means of coming up with the money. Meanwhile, a samurai named Yaemon of the Takada clan visits the Izumo-ya and says he wants to buy the rabbit comb that Usagi inhabits at any price.\nSource: crunchyroll",
