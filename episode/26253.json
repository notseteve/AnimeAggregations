  "description" : "One night, Masaomi explains to Riku about what Toujinshi and Shikigami are, and why the Ten-ryuu and the Chi-ryuu are currently fighting. It seems that the Chi-ryuu is interested in opening the Fukumaden Kimon, a gate that leads to demons and a power that could destroy the world, and the Ten-ryuu are trying to keep the Fukumaden Kimon closed. Masaomi also says that when Toujinshi lose their Shikigami, the Toujinshi lose their memories. Later, when Riku decides to clean up the damaged shrine, Yuuma confronts him, asking him about the Head of the Ten-ryuu. Then, his little brother, Souma, sick of Yuuma being on Mikazuchi`s side, steps in and attempts to fight with him. However, Yuuma and Rangetsu end up fighting against Masaomi and his Shikigami, Seiryuu no Kibachiyo.\nSource: TheTVDB",
