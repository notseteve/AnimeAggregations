  "description" : "A new girl has just transferred into Yoichi`s class, named Tsubame Tsubasa, who like Yoichi has lived her life until then in the mountains training her Tsubame Benten-style martial arts with Takatsukasa Angela. The two of them have been hired by a mysterious person to assassinate Yoichi, intending to use the payment to advance their school of martial arts, but Tsubasa has no wish to do so and longs for life as a normal girl, so rather than fighting him she befriends him, much to Angela`s consternation. One day, as Tsubasa is leaving school with Yoichi and Ibuki, Angela rips off her clothes, turning her into a deadly martial artist in a trance-like state due to her embarrassment, and so she attacks Yoichi. Before the fight escalates further Washizu interrupts, causing Tsubasa to break out of her trance and flee crying from embarrassment, and she resents Angela as a result.\nLater that evening Angela herself attacks Yoichi, and tells her the reasons why she is trying to kill him, but he convinces her that is the wrong way, and that the pride they have in their art is the important thing. Later, she makes up with Tsubasa and they decide to work at a nearby ramen shop to make ends meet instead.",
