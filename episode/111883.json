  "description" : "A Neo-Zeon remnant group called the \"Sleeves\" travels to Side 4`s Industrial 7 colony, so that its captain, Zinnerman, can receive a \"key\" to something known as \"Laplace`s Box\" from Vist Foundation leader Cardeas Vist. The item is said to be capable of either restoring the future or destroying the world. Audrey Burne seeks to meet Vist first and convince him not to turn over Laplace`s Box, believing the Sleeves will use it to start another war. Along the way, she is rescued by 16-year-old student Banagher Links, who agrees to take her to Vist. Meanwhile, a battle breaks out between the Federation`s Londo Bell taskforce and the Sleeves. As the collateral damage rises, the colony is evacuated. Amidst the chaos, Banagher discovers the fatally-wounded Cardeas Vist in the cockpit of the Unicorn Gundam. Before his death, Vist entrusts the Gundam to Banagher, who realizes that Vist is his father. Banagher then launches in the Unicorn and confronts the Sleeves` elite pilot, Marida Cruz, who is piloting the Kshatriya.\nSource: Wikipedia",
