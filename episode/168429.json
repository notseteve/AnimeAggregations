  "description" : "Luce continues training Kagami`s students after his visit. The next day, Kagami`s team is officially registered for the quest, with Makina filling in the 35th slot after Kagami convinced her to join, as it would give her a chance to speak with Koutarou and persuade him to return to school. They find that the other teams competing in the quest have withdrawn after a guild known as Monsters Factory with a formidable reputation announces participation. Luce appears, but is lifeless as Koutarou is away from his keyboard. The battle begins, but Kagami goes away from his keyboard to get Koutarou, leaving his students to fight on their own until the two return.\nKagami chases after Koutarou, and the boy tells him about how he was always drawn to cute things and preferred to dress in girl`s clothing. After he tried going out once he was bullied by a group of classmates, and injured one of them, and from then on isolated himself. He fears that his new classmates will treat him the same way once the know about his proclivities. Nevertheless Kagami shows him how they have been playing the game seriously and convinces him to return to the quest. Their return to the game as The First and Luce turns the tide and their team is victorious. Kagami`s students invite him to play with them again soon, but he is hesitant, afraid that they will not accept him once they learn who he is.",
