  "description" : "Solomon, son of David, is a man of matchless intelligence, and he has keen insight into human nature. So he becomes a wise ruler who wins a great deal of public confidence. But as time passes, he eventually loses his love for God, builds the shrine of Solomon, and finally allows people to worship idols outside the castle. Solomon thus violates the Ten Commandments.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
