  "description" : "Mio, Kuchinashi, and Setsuna are challenged by the duet of Nanami and Misaki to see which group will get to represent the Pretty Girl Squad at the upcoming Simeon Grand Opening ceremony. Riru assigns them both a pointless side quest to complete in order to determine the winner. Meanwhile, Blade`s group fails to surreptitiously infiltrate the Opening Day ceremony. Naturally, they fail in the most conspicuous of ways. Oh, and pics...or it didn`t happen.",
