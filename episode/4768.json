  "description" : "Gan-chan the rat is in need of a female companion. To help him, Urd arrives with a crystal ball and offers to predict Gan-chan`s future spouse. However, Urd`s predictions are all inanimate objects. She finally settles upon a kettle, and Gan-chan marries Mrs. Kettle. Urd gives the kettle a voice-over and legs during the honeymoon, but Gan-chan insists on Mrs. Kettle having her own voice. However, once Mrs. Kettle can speak, she declares that she has fallen for another kettle and elopes, leaving Gan-chan single again.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
