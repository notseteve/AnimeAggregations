  "description" : "Itami`s squad and the girls have returned from Japan. The JSDF basecamp at Arnus Hill has become the centre of a thriving town as trade across the gate between the Special Region and Japan flourishes. Pinya and a Japanese diplomat have begun meeting with imperial nobles, attempting to convince the most hawkish of them to consider peace with Japan by giving them gifts and negotiating the release of important prisoners of war captured during the first assault by the Empire against Japan.\nMeanwhile, Itami is at a tavern with Rory, who is still trying to seduce him. A dark elf woman named Yao Ha Dyusshi appears, looking for what she calls the \"green men\" (the JSDF) trying to get their help. She denounces Itami for apparently corrupting a minor, and her interference irritates Rory. She makes the misunderstanding deep enough that the Yao draws her sword on Itami, who flees. It turns out that Yao is looking for help to finally finish off the fire dragon that Itami`s group encountered earlier, and offers a huge diamond as reward.",
