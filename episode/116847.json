  "description" : "Just a normal day in the lives of Mom, Dad, Bunji and Fumi. They all have things to do, and gather around Mom. She loved times like these. Mom tells the stories of why Bunji wore diapers for so long and why Fumi took so long to take her first steps. In fact, Mom was the reason for both of these... Bunji is acting like Hopperman and drags Mom and Dad into it. Right when they think it`s over, Bunji makes a wild proposition...! Fumi leaves food wrappers laying around. Bunji leaves the door open. It turns out the kids lose their focus when they go into the magical world through the \"Children`s Door.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
