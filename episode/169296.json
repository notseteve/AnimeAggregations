  "description" : "With all guests now gathered, except for Son Gokuu and Vegeta, Bulma`s birthday party gets underway. Trunks shows Son Goten where his mother hid the bingo tournament grand prize – the Dragon Balls. Not far off from the ship, Pilaf Gang, now poor and hungry, are trying to get by until they find the Dragon Balls and make their wishes come true. When his Dragon Radar picks up a signal coming from Bulma`s ship, Pilaf and his henchmen hastily board the ship, with Trunks and Goten`s help. Meanwhile, on his planet, Kaiou-sama explains to Gokuu who and what Beerus exactly is and that for every benevolent God there must be a malevolent one in order to keep the Universe in balance. Just as he finishes, Beerus and Whis arrive.\nSource: Wikipedia",
