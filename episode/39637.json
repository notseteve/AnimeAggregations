  "description" : "The Star Force arrives at Guardiana, a planet which is hidden in a subspace pocket. But, they are followed by Desslok`s main fleet and the Bolar armada as well, thus exposing Guardiana`s secret location. The Star Force learns that the planet is utterly peaceful, and tells Desslok that it poses no threat to anyone. Desslok agrees to leave the planet alone, but must first fight off the Bolars who have followed him there. He attempts to \"put an end to Bolar incursions once and for all\" by using his Hyper Desslok Gun (Excelsior). It wipes out a huge chunk of the Bolar armada. After the battle, Queen Mariposa shows the Star Force executive staff the hidden arsenal of super weapons that Guardianans have put away -- never to be used again. Mariposa undergoes a metamorphosis and melds with the spirit of Queen Guardiana. She gives the Star Force a HydroCosmoGen Cannon which can restore the sun to its normal state. The Star Force beats a fast path home. \n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
