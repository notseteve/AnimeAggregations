  "description" : "Not only did Duskmon throw BurningGreymon around like a sack of potatoes, he took the Digidestined to task without even flinching. Later, Takuya came up with a plan to defeat him but that just started an argument with Koji, who knew Duskmon was too powerful to fight. Although he didn`t have much of a choice since the big man showed up and smacked KendoGarurumon hard, turning him back into Koji. Now, things were getting weird, it was like Duskmon was in pain and then darkness covered everyone. Takuya woke up alone in the Dark Terminal and when Dark Trailmon offered him a chance to go home, he took it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
