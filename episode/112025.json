  "description" : "Tsuna finally gives in and tells Kyoko and Haru everything. He tells them about the Vongola Family, about Byakuran, and about their upcoming battle. When Tsuna finishes explaining, Haru stays strong and just gives Tsuna a smile. But later, when she’s alone, Haru thinks about the burden everyone had been carrying and she begins to cry at her uselessness. Tsuna had told the girls without consulting the others, and he is worried that they won’t forgive him. Just then, someone hacks into the HQ’s communication system, and the person who appears on the screen is Byakuran!\nSource: crunchyroll",
