  "description" : "When Akari takes her gondola in for a routine inspection, she`s given some startling news - the repairman tells her that the gondola is now too old and worn for tourism use, and should be sold off for hauling cargo.  Although she at first resists, Akari knows that the repairman is right; so she decides to travel with her gondola to all the wonderful places that she`s been, as a way of saying goodbye.\nSource: crunchyroll",
