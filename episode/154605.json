  "description" : "Elsa comes by Leon and asks for help as her convenience store is short-handed for the day, and Sarah gives permission for Fino to work for them temporarily, despite Raul`s misgivings. Fino begins training to work at the convenience store and Ram shows her a trick for how to use the store`s magical appliances without the disaster that usually entails when she tries to use any such devices. Fino mixes all sorts of strange ingredients into the store`s oden, and this unexpectedly comes up to be delicious, but they can`t sell it since it`s not the store`s standard recipe. They later offer this to everyone after their work is done.\nMeanwhile, back at Leon, Raul starts to notice Nova in spite of himself, and since there are so few customers in the store that leads to some awkwardness. This is made even more awkward when the dirty old man who always comes by to touch Nova`s behind comes by, and after he has bought his light bulb Nova says that Raul can touch her behind too if he wants, although Visor warns him that sexual harassment will not be tolerated.",
