  "description" : "After the success of the last mission, Lenka`s punishment for insubordination is suspended and he is assigned along with Alisa and Kouta to Rindou`s unit. Kouta brings Lenka to the town and introduces him to his mother, and shows him the Aegis, which is being built on an island across the bay, which is supposed to provide shelter from the Aragami for the entire human race.\nThey are then sent on their first combat mission as a team, and are ordered to hunt a specific species of Aragami and recover their cores, which are to be used as components of the Aegis. Kouta panics, and Alisa does not seem to be working well with the rest of the team. After completing the mission they find a small family of survivors, and bring them back to base. These refugees are refused entry after they are found not to possess the factors required to become God Eaters.",
