  "description" : "As Junna stops by the Robotics Club and agrees to join, Kaito recalls what Mizuka told him about how Akiho`s sister, Misaki, was allegedly friends with Airi. As Kaito once again visits Airi later that night to hear more details, including how Kimijima Kou created her, he follows a strange noise to an underground room, where he finds an EGI device used to send frequencies into outer space. As Kaito tries to find more from Airi`s `Sister Centipede` mode, he learns that Kimijima Kou was murdered. After enough hassling from Subaru, Kona decides to join the Robotics Club, agreeing to help him with his controls if Kaito helps to find cheaters running amok in Kill Ballad. Kona manages to complete the program in a few days while Junna helps Akiho secure a sponsorship for their robot from candy brand owner, Nagafukada Sumio. As they practice the controls, Subaru is approached by his father, who doesn`t take kindly to him taking up robots again. As Subaru ends up giving in to his father`s demands, Akiho, saddened by Subaru`s dream being destroyed, suffers another \"Elephant-Mouse Syndrome\" attack. \nSource: Wikipedia",
