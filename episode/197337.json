  "description" : "Amakasu  Hisone tends to hurt people unconsciously, as she is too honest. Suffering in a relationship, she joined Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) as a fixed term staff and was assigned to Gifu base. One day Hisone was sent to \"the 8th hangar\" and there bumped into a dragon. And what is more, she was swallowed by him! The dragon is called OTF (Organic Transformed Flyer), which has been managed by JASDF since ancient times. This is how Hisone`s new phase of life as a dragon pilot begins.\nSource: Official page",
