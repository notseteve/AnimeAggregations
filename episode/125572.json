  "description" : "Ringo and the others have come to Fairy Land. However, something seems different from normal. It turns out there is a Countdown Party at the Queen`s Castle today. In Fairy Land, they hold a giant party to welcome to the new year as it only begins after Ikkuru and Kukkuru, the fairy of the year past and the fairy of the coming year, join hands. After greeting the girls, the Queen takes them to visit Ikkuru. Upon arriving at Ikkuru`s room, the girls are shocked. The furnishings in Ikkuru`s room are strewn everywhere and it is littered with junk while Ikkuru is sprawled out and looking bored. It seems the state of the room is causing Ikkuru to sulk. The Queen tells the girls that in this state, Ikkuru might not show up at the Countdown Party.\nSource: crunchyroll",
