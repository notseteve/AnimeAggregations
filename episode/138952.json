  "description" : "The Melancholy of Randy: Randy is walking alone one day, having problems with something and Chevy and her friends noticed her. Panky accidentally knocked her in mud puddle as Chevy decided to help her get out of the mud. She later explained that she is in love with Em and somehow can`t admit her true feelings to him. Worse, Em is with another female Zooble in that time stalking him. The trio consulted Kumanpa to find a way to bring the two lovebirds together, though its advice didn`t made sense. However....after they went to see Randy wearing a strange mask, hilarity ensures as Em ends up with Silvy and she ends up heartbroken, again.\nSu-Su Came!: Chevy and her friends were doing Yoga one day in the Rainbow Fountain until Coron notices her milk bottle is upside down and empty. She blamed the two for it but then notices it wasn`t their fault. They then realize it was the work of Su-Su, a Pineapple Orange-flavored Monkey Zooble, and has come to Candy Land and is causing a lot of upside down pranks. And worse, the residents were in chaos on what he`s doing. Chevy and her friends need to stop him before the whole Candy Land goes upside-down!",
