  "description" : "At Arata’s apartment, Ryo tells Arata that his ReLife was a huge success and offers him a list of jobs and a pill that will end his ReLife. At Chizuru’s apartment, An is doing the same thing with Chizuru. Chizuru falls asleep after taking the pill and An sees that she had written “I was in love with Kaizaki Arata” on her hand and feels sad that she will have to erase it. Before taking the pill, Arata tells Ryo that he wants to work for ReLife Laboratories. Later, at a ReLife Company dinner, Arata meets Chizuru, who is also working for ReLife. They do not recognize each other, but Chizuru learns that Arata was a ReLife subject.\nAfter dinner, they bump into each other outside the restaurant. Chizuru tells Arata that she too was a ReLife subject and Arata asks Chizuru about her ReLife experience. She replies that it was like a firework. This triggers the memory of being together at the fireworks festival for both of them. Then with their memories restored, Chizuru walks into Arata’s waiting arms.\nSource: Wikipedia",
