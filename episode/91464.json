  "description" : "Kuu is given a chance at a lottery and wins a pair of tickets to an Onsen, (a public bath), food included. The boys are reunited with their grandmother and uncle on this vacation. While everyone else decides to go to the town to shop for souvenirs, Toru chooses to stay by himself at the inn to play with a little girl. Unfortunately, the girl turns out to be a Zashiki-warashi who proceeds to drain Toru of his energy. Kou, realizing that nobody is protecting Toru, hurries back with the others only to find the inn in turmoil. Kuu captures the spirit, who then restores Toru. Toru and Noboru defend Kuu and Kou from their grandmother`s rebukes regarding their guardianship.\nSource: crunchyroll",
