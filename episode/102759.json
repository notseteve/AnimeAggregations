  "description" : "The preliminary round for the Official Tsu Terakado fan club title is a marathon race. With Takachin in critical condition and Kagura taking the wrong route, team Shinpachi’s chances of winning look slim. But thanks to Gintoki’s quick thinking, Takachin makes an instant (and improved?) recovery and emerges from the hospital to rejoin the race! As the race gradually turns into a battle of deception, Shinpachi runs furiously for the goal. Will he be able to beat the tactical general Tosshi?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
