  "description" : "At night Kyouichi has strange dreams and wonders whether they indicate his loneliness. Makoto has a simpler name for this feeling: \"need girlfriend syndrome\".\nAt his school`s arts club Kyouichi meets Yokota-senpai who just completed a marvelous drawing of an inconspicuous female classmate whom he obviously adores. Suddenly Kyouichi becomes aware that they are colleagues at his part-time job at a video shop. The two young artists start to talk; Yokota confesses he never even had a girlfriend before, and Makoto tells Yokota about Kyouichi just having been dumped.\nSoon Kyouichi and Yokota are spending a lot of time together, alienating Makoto formidably: Are these two boys starting a weird romance?",
