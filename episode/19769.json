  "description" : "Hägen unleashes the mighty technique Universe Freezing against Hyoga, but it is useless against him as he easily breaks free. Hyoga then tells Hägen that he let himself be captured by Asgard soldiers to discover what happened to Hilda. He was even severely beaten by Thor. But Freya came to Hyoga`s cell and freed him, hoping that Athena and her Saints would help save her sister and Asgard. Hägen refuses to listen and attacks Hyoga with vicious assaults. Hägen remembers being Freya`s closest friend during their childhood and one of Hilda`s most loyal warriors. Hyoga attacks with the Aurora Thunder Attack, but Hägen attack retaliates with Great Ardent Pressure, a fire technique which easily renders Hyoga`s attack useless. Hägen then goes into a cave. Hyoga follows, sensing a lot of heat and encounters a massive river of lava, the only warm place in Asgard. Hägen confronts Hyoga once more, but Since Hyoga was raised in Siberia, he is unable to handle the massive heat. As Hägen attacks Hyoga, Kiki senses the battle and informs Freya who heads off to stop the fighting.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
