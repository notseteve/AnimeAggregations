  "description" : "Mitsuki stares into the mirror, practicing different ways to get the corners of his mouth to line up with his glasses when he smiles. One particular smile causes a golden light to shine from his face. The ratio of the distance between the corners of his mouth and the distance from the corner of his mouth to his glasses is 1:1.618. Mitsuki overflows with hope as he realizes what he`s done. Morning. The birds sing in the trees. An alarm clock goes off. Takuma rolls out of bed; he`s bent his temple. This is a day in the life of the Suzumine Brothers.\nSource: crunchyroll",
