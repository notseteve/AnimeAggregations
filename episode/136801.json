  "description" : "After finding Jin a complete wreck, Baron explains to Gammon about how POG`s leader, Count Pythagoras, intends to bring about a conflict between Kaito and Rook in order to open the gate to the Puzzle of God, whilst Kaito reads up on what Cubic had found on POG`s network. Years ago, Pythagoras once attempted to achieve Phi Brain using Jin, who contracted with Orpheus and became a solver for POG. However, one day, Jin received a vision of the future, showing the world being destroyed by Pythagoras. Jin quit POG whilst Baron stayed to become a Giver, working together to find a way to prevent Pythagoras from achieving the God Scrolls. Two years prior to the story, Jin left to fight against Pythagoras in the Puzzle of God, though the results are unknown. As Kaito and the other files discover a hidden file on the POG network reading `Phythagoras is dead`, Rook appears before them, revealing he has been the one in control of the POG since Pythagoras` death half a year ago. As Rook reveals himself to be an Orpheus contractor, Kaito`s vision shows that the one supposedly responsible for destroying the world is himself.\nSource: Wiki",
