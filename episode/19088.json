  "description" : "Nanoka and Koshiro visit Mama together. After, sitting by the sea, Nanoka asks Koshiro if they should commit lover`s suicide. He cries and says he doesn`t know. She says that she is fine either way as long as she is with him. Koshiro quits his job. On his way out he meets Kaname, who wishes him well. Koshiro stands outside his father`s house and says \"Excuse me\". The couple frolic in the playground to the disapproving stares of the local matrons. Then at night they sneak into the amusement park where they met. They sit on the ferris wheel and try to move it by prayer. It moves a bit. They carve their names on a tree and promise to go back there every year. When Nanoka has walked off to go home, Koshiro says \"I love you\".\nSource: theTVDB.com",
