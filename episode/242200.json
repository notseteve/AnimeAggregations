Thanks to Miyuki and her friends, the situation does not escalate out of control, but Honoka and the others are enraged with Blanche’s actions. Miyuki and Tatsuya head to the enemy hideout along with Erika in order to crush Blanche. When Blanche’s combatants ridicule magicians as being monsters, Miyuki unleashes her powerful magic on them.\nSource: Funimation",
