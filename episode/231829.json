  "description" : "Anos and the students from the Demon King Academy participate in their first day of inter-academy exchange with the Hero Academy. However, the students from the Demon King Academy soon find out that the inter-academy exchange is in name only, and they are met with outright hostility. Revest, a third-year student at the top of his class from the Demon King Academy is ridiculed by the students from the Hero Academy when he unsuccessfully tries to activate a magic spell. The students from the Demon King Academy are visibly offended by this treatment, but Anos`s words turn the tables. \"As usual, humans sure like to set traps for us, don`t they?\" The inter-academy exchange is off to an ominous start.\nSource: crunchyroll",
