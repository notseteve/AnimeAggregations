  "description" : "After crashing their raft about a million times, the gang finally made it to the Autumn Leaf Fair but they still couldn`t find the Toucanmon. Tommy found out that Datamon had the D-Tectors and needed something to trade for them. When out looking, he found the Toucanmon and saved their lives but those jerks just ran off again. Then a big fight broke out between Datamon & Petaldramon. Datamon gave the guys their D-Tectors back and they sent Petaldramon packing. Now that they have their D-Tectors again, everything seems great but that probably won`t last long.\nSource: crunchyroll",
