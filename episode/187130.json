  "description" : "Now that Hoshitani realizes that Otori is his long admired high school student, he doesn`t know what to do or how to act and his suddenly odd behavior begins to worry those around him. Meanwhile, Ageha is thrilled with finally getting to meet his \"god\", Tsukigami Haruto, and is eager to prove that he is the most suited for Haruto`s former role. However, Haruto doesn`t react to Ageha`s performance as he had hoped and Ageha is thrown into doubt.
