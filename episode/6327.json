  "description" : "While trying to find food, the gang met up with the Shellnumemon and they agreed to help rescue the women from the evil Grumblemon. When they told the snails they were Legendary Warriors, they were captured and traded for the women! Turns out the creep who stole the women is also a Legendary Warrior. Grumblemon has the power to Beast Spirit Evolve to Gigasmon and he defeated our heroes. With the gang split up, it looks like the Forest Terminal will have to wait until they find each other.\nSource: crunchyroll",
