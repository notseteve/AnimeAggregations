  "description" : "The Ikeda Lab is, as is traditional, doing something for the university`s Mutsumi Festival, an event which draws many people from off-campus. Yukimura proposes conducting a large-scale experiment on the importance of appearance for romance. He has readied a large number of cosplay costumes to rent out to visitors who will then participate in an attractiveness rating. In order to emphasize how important appearance is, Yukimura projects a series of images of Himuro in cosplay on the screen, including Himuro in a nurse`s uniform, a maid`s uniform, and a black cat style outfit?!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
