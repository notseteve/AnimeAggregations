  "description" : "Sheffield uses the stolen mirror artifact to transfer Louise`s Explosion power to Joseph and he uses it to detonate a fire stone, destroying the airships attacking him. Saito and Tabitha make their way towards Joseph’s ship while he detonates another stone on the retreating ships. Louise manages to escape and takes the last stone with her, but Sheffield’s gargoyle recovers it, as Saito and Tabitha arrive to save Louise. Tabitha and Louise go after the gargoyle, while Saito uses Julio`s gift, a modern gun, to incapacitate Sheffield and confront Joseph. On the ground, Tifa uses ancient magic to stop the gargoyle, allowing Tabitha to recover the stone. Joseph uses his void power, Acceleration, to move at high speed and subdue Saito, but Louise and Tabitha return and save him. Tabitha fatally wounds her uncle, but decides against killing him just as Sheffield returns and forces the group to leave her to die with Joseph, so the trio escapes just as the ship explodes from the last stone. Back at the Cathedral, Saito voices his suspicions that Vittorio used Louise as bait to lure Joseph and kill him, to which Vittorio admits. Louise tells Saito that it’s alright since she has him to protect her and he agrees, reaffirming their bond. Tifa, who was watching, both admires and is saddened by their close bond, believing it proves that Saito is not her familiar.\nSource: Wiki",
