  "description" : "Under an overcast, rainy sky, a blue-haired high school boy lies among the shattered ruins of a city, and a pink-haired high school girl appears, wielding a large bladed weapon, who kneels beside him and kisses him while resting the point of her weapon on his chest. Nishijou Takumi is a very reclusive person who lives in a storage container; he is not interested in the real world and suffers from a delusion with Seira Orgel, his favorite anime character. His friend Misumi tells him about a series of incidents called the New Generation events. Takumi chats with a person named Shogun who shows him a barrage of image links depicting a murder of a man being hung by stakes. Horrified, he goes to an internet café to ease his mind. After, he walks into a dark alley and is horrified to watch the murder he saw online; only it is real and happening in front in his eyes. He also sees a pink-haired schoolgirl covered in blood wearing his school`s uniform standing right next to the bloody scene. She then calls out his name. He runs away while unintentionally carrying one of the stakes. The next day, he feels someone is stalking him and finds it was a girl named Kusunoki Yua. She tells him that she too is a fan of Seira. After some initial reluctance, he finally agrees to accompany her to pre-order the latest Seira figurine. The next day, he is shocked to find the pink-haired girl sitting next to him. \nSource: Wikipedia",
