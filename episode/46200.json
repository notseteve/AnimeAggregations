  "description" : "This special is a set of short comedy stories involving Gintoki and his equally-broke sidekicks Shinpachi and Kagura. One day, Gintoki and his comrades are out viewing the spring flowers when suddenly the Shinsengumi appear, arguing that Gintoki has taken their flower-viewing spot. Gintoki`s team and the Shinsengumi must then battle for the right to sit in that spot by using a violent version of rock paper scissors.",
