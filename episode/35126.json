  "description" : "There is a prophet who wanders through the desert. He is very worried about the Hebrews becoming corrupted and acting against God. But he also feels that everything will change soon and that God`s voice will be heard around the world. One night, an angel Gabriel comes to Mary, who is a fifteen- year-old girl living in Nazareth. He said, \"Mary, don`t be afraid. You have God`s blessing. You will have a baby boy. Name him Jesus. He will be a great man, and will be called the son of the Lord...\" Then true to the revelation, the virgin Mary becomes pregnant.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
