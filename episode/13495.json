  "description" : "Aprodite informs Shun that Seiya will die at the stem of his poisonous “Demon Roses” which are planted to prevent any invadoers from hurting the pope. Once Seiya breathes in any of the pollen or touches any of the thorns, he will lose all of his senses and eventually die. During their battle, Aphrodite reveals to Shun that it was he who killed Shun’s mentor on Andromeda island. So, Shun has a double agenda for destroying Aphrodite: to avenge his mentor’s death and to get to Seiya in time to save him. After initially suffering at the attacks of Aprodite’s gold saint powers. Shun realises his seventh-sense power and begins to answer back with strong attack of his own. Shun uses his powerful “Thunder wave” attack and almost has Aprodite defeated, when all of a sudden, a large black rose appears out of nowhere and brings Shun’s attack to halt.\nSource: crunchyroll",
