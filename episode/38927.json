  "description" : "On the Planet Meduse, Honerva discovers a race of Gorgons who are able to turn enemies into stone by looking at them. Thinking this would make an excellent Beastman, they kidnap a female Gorgon and force her to fight the GoLion team. Instead the Gorgon takes Shorty and treats him as her own child due to his size. An enraged Sincline sends a backup Beastman to destroy the GoLion team and their new Gorgon ally as well!\nSource: crunchyroll",
