Right when a giant beetle settles down on her back, a young man collecting beetles frees her from the unwanted guest and shows her the way back to her camp. But Chiharu can`t stand the pushy behavior of this show-off cabriolet driver, introducing himself as Okasagi Yuki.\nAki and Yumi visit Chiharu at the camp, telling her how comfortable their holidays at the sea together with Makoto and Kyouichi had been. Which brings back uncomfortable memories for Chiharu about her argument with Kyouichi... and during her next training race she loses concentration, stumbles - and falls.",
