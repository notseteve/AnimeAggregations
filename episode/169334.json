  "description" : "Rito once again becomes the victim of one of Lala`s inventions, which turns him into a mouse. He runs around the school frantically, trying to find her, causing mayhem wherever he goes, although the girls who like him find his mouse form inexplicably cute. He winds up falling into Yami`s clothes and winds up pulling off her panties in an attempt to escape, and Mea finds him, at which point he turns back into human form, and Yami once again beats him senseless for the offence.\nLater, Rito sees Mea dressed in battle gear at the rooftop and he goes to see her, despite Momo`s earlier admonition to avoid being alone with her. She uses her powers to control him like a doll after he suggests that her master might be wrong, but she releases him after he says he feels her feelings of uncertainty and loneliness, but that she need not be alone. They are attacked by a group of aliens who have been told Mea`s location by Nemesis, which Mea interprets as being a reminder of her nature as a weapon, and as they cross the town in battle Nana sees her in her true form, with blades ready to kill.",
