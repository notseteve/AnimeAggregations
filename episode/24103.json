  "description" : "Having lost Leharl, Poseidon orders Leneus, his strategic right-hand man, to kill Triton. Leneus, instead of doing it himself, instructs Commander Bruda of the Indian Ocean to attack Triton. Then Bruda orders Armon, the god of death, to terminate Triton. Triton, on the other hand, has no idea of the hasty exchanges among the Poseidon army, and heads for the Atlantic Ocean. On the way, Triton and his friends find a strange island and land there. Soon they discover that the island is in fact the sea anemone monster Armon, the god of death. They begin a tough battle.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
