  "description" : "Xanxus`s box weapon is the Sky Storm Liger: Ligre Tempesta di Cielo, which has the attributes of both Sky and Storm. Xanxus closes his box and orders Sil to call Byakuran. Sil hints that he`s open to negotiating, but he is actually buying himself time to attack Xanxus, who is not using a box weapon at the moment. Sil uses his box weapon, Storm Bat: Pipistrello Tempesta, to surround Xanxus, and plans to attack him with special invisible storm flames. But in the next moment, the Storm Bat is crushed by a beam of light! It is Xanxus`s flames of rage which were fired from his twin pistols. Even without his box weapon, Xanxus`s fighting power is unfathomable!\nSource: crunchyroll",
