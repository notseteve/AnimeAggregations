  "description" : "After a long journey, Wooser finds himself in a world where humans are ruled by machines.  \"I`m an animal, though, so I don`t care,\" says Wooser, unconcerned. But an endless assault by robot soldiers puts him up against the wall: \"At this rate, I`ll run out of quarters...\"  He`s barely got enough money to make bus fare home... can he awaken to a new power?  Maybe? Please?\nSource: crunchyroll",
