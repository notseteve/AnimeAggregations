  "description" : "Inside of the Divine Gate, Sabrac falls, gazing at the greatness of the Snake of the Festival in his true form. The God of Creation then sends out a signal and starts moving towards the Divine Gate. After the signal is felt by everyone, Sophie Sawallisch attempts to destroy the Gate. At the last moment, Fecor protects it and dies from the power of the spell. Back in the Gate, Shana and Yuji are fighting. Because of a memory that vows between two people are sealed with a kiss on the lips, Shana tries to kiss Yuji on the cheek and says that is her vow. She is then taken away abruptly by the ghosts of the Flame Hazes before she can make the kiss and is brought outside of the Gate as it breaks and the Snake of the Festival comes out. All Denizens cheer and all Flame Hazes stand in astonishment and despair and amongst this, Shana recognizes this as a sound not of a fall, but of the start of a new battle.\nSource: Wiki",
