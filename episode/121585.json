  "description" : "Finally, the showdown between Natsu and Laxus begins to determine just who the strongest wizard is in Fairy Tail! Meanwhile, Erza is in a battle against time to destroy all the hundreds of lacrima floating above Magnolia, moments away from raining destruction on the unsuspecting townspeople. Even Erza realizes she doesn`t have enough power to destroy all of them at once, and just when things look grim, a voice calls out... Meanwhile, Natsu gives it his best against Laxus, but faced with such overwhelming power his attacks seem to do nothing. Might even Natsu have to get some help to protect the guild he loves?\nSource: crunchyroll",
