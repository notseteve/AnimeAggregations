  "description" : "Falis and Alita get into an argument, and Falis goes off to vent her steam on the encroaching goblins. During this time, Akamashi`s aides kidnap Alita and interrogate her about her real identity and about the \"key\". Falis goes to the rescue but is coerced into dropping her weapon. A swordsman then leaps onto the scene and saves the day; he turns out to be none other than Prince Kaito, Alita`s brother.",
