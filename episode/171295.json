  "description" : "Gokuu and Beerus continue to fight in space. As both of them power up and clash, the universe begins to crumble under the power of the gods. Celestial bodies blow up due to the shockwaves. Meanwhile, Old Kaioushin reveals to the younger Kaioushin that with three more blows the whole universe would be destroyed along with Beerus and Gokuu. Gokuu, on landing the third clash with Beerus, unknowingly stops the universe`s collapse by balancing Beerus` attack with his own. Beerus gets enraged and uses his atomic bomb attack on Gokuu. Gokuu uses the Super Saiyan God energy to power up his Kamehameha attack to keep Beerus` attack at bay.\nSource: Wikipedia",
