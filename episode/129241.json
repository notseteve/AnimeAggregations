  "description" : "Chiiko is normally one of the kindest, most respected teachers at Harumi`s school, but all of a sudden she starts acting violently. The reason can only be that she inhaled some of the toxic gas from a certain evil spirit, and the biggest problem is that anyone who inhales the gas will also be consumed by that spirit in just three days time!\nThe only way the group can save Chiiko is by putting Yukiko-hime in her place... but in order to do that they first need to somehow get Chiiko`s bikini off her so that Yukiko-hime can wear it in her place. Harumi and Yukiko-hime sneak into Chiiko`s bedroom while she is asleep to try and get the bikini, but it might not go quite as planned...\nSource: Official Site",
