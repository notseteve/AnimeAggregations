  "description" : "It is the school trip, and Yamada and Shiraishi swap bodies for most of it, so she can continue studying, leaving Yamada to deal with the business of socialising with the girls. Eventually he convinces her to swap back, and Odagiri Nene, Miyamura`s main rival to becoming the next student council president, attempts to blackmail him with a pictures of him (actually Shiraishi in his body) rooting through Shiraishi`s underwear. She tries to get Yamada to convince Shiraishi to not attend the mock exam a couple of days later. He tries to use the body swap power on Odagiri in an attempt to delete the incriminating photos but finds that the power does not work on her. After kissing both Itou and Miyamura to test, he finds that he is no longer able to swap bodies. After they get back from the school trip, he finds that Itou and Miyamura have fallen in love with him. It seems that he lost the power to swap bodies and instead charms people whom he kisses. Kissing Itou and Miyamura cancels this power again. They realise that the change happened right after he kissed Odagiri.",
