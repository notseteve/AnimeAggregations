  "description" : "Tony recalls five years ago when he was attacked and captured by terrorists, receiving life threatening injuries. Agreeing to make weapons for the terrorist, he was saved by fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen who installed his magnetic chest plate to keep him alive and helped him realize the deaths his weapons manufacturing has caused. This led to the creation of the mini arc-reactor and, subsequently, Iron Man, but Yinsen sacrificed himself to give Tony a chance to escape. Meanwhile in the present, a race driver named Kawashima, who had broken his legs and desires to drive again, is given cybernetic enhancements on the condition that he kill Tony. When Tony is targeted, he is saved by the sudden appearance of James \"Logan\" Howlett, who is in Japan investigating A.I.M. Iron Man later fights against Kawashima, who controls the Zodiac warrior Taurus but is soon taken over by it. With the help of Logan, Iron Man defeats Taurus and rescues Kawashima, but soon comes face to face with Dio and is shocked to find what appears to be Yinsen inside.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
