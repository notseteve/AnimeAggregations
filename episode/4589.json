So she avoids the other Haibane and even eats out alone. At town, Hyouko asks her about the light from the forest and whether it was Reki who departed; the mood she is in, Rakka can`t just stand this boy being glad. Anyway, Rakka has a new problem to worry about: Her wings. But this brings her an ally who knows this issue only too well.",
