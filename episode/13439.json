  "description" : "Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria go on their mission as militia at night to recover a devilish corpse smuggled by a mafia. As the corpse calls forth his minions, the three are soon interrupted by Satella Harvenheit, who is a jewelsummoner. The four take down the minions, while corpse escapes. Satella realizes that Chrono is a devil, questioning his purpose in the Magdalene Order. On the next morning, Satella encounters the three again at a crime scene caused by the mafia, much to her dismay. They follow her to a park, where they all stop to eat some hot dogs. Chrono empathizes for the fact Rosette and Satella both are searching for someone in their lives for years on end. The same devilish corpse reappears, and the four work together and are able to destroy the corpse once and for all. Nonetheless, Satella, who bears a grudge against demons due to her past, departs in shame. \nSource: Wikipedia",
