Miu almost succeeds, but hits a highway sign instead. The next day, Miu and Ayane are at their school, when they see what appears to be a ghost. They decide to follow it, and in the process stumble upon an elevator that takes them to an underground complex. Down there they discover something that can help them find the Invaders.\nSource: Wiki",
