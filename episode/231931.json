  "description" : "Subaru is shown several visions of events previously unknown to him during the second phase of the trial. When he feels as if he`s worn away to nearly nothing, the one to stir him is the one who loves him more than anyone else... and is tougher on him than anyone else. When he awakens to see Echidna extending a hand to help him, he tells her he`ll never accept it. Then the Witch of Envy appears, clad in a veil of darkness, and extends her hand to him as well. Subaru refuses again, screaming that he`ll solve everything on his own without any of their help.\nSource: crunchyroll",
