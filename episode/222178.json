  "description" : "Wanting to become stronger herself, Rin received training from Manji, but is still a long way off from matching him in ability, much less the Ittou-ryu. Rin, in her melancholy, is drawn in by a sound, and finds a man training on his own. `Some day I`ll be like him`, Rin tells herself, then is astonished upon seeing the man`s face. It`s her arch-nemesis, the head of the Ittou-ryu, Kagehisa Anotsu.\nSource: Amazon",
