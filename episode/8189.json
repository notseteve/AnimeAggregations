  "description" : "Maki`s involuntary encounter with Julietta Sakamoto left her confused. She spaces out and decided not to go to school because something still doesn`t feel right. She wants the challenge of battle but knows it is not possible. Mina begins to worry about Maki who did not come to school and decides to visit her, even thought she does not know her address. Michiru, Yuu, Shinnosuke and the very strangely dressed Renge follow Mina. Renge casts a strange spell and impressively locates Maki. As they begin to approach Maki, she`s walking through the rain without an umbrella while appearing to be gathered in deep thought they were unable to call to her. After leaving a letter for Julietta in his mailbox, Maki went to the gym of fighter named Shiro Saeki. It seems like there is a long history between Maki and Shiro. At the same time, Julietta, who had received the letter from Maki, was very excited about its contents.\nSource: crunchyroll",
