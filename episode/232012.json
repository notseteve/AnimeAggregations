  "description" : "Glenn and the others continue to prepare for Skadi’s surgery. Arahnia is also getting better with Glenn’s guidance, but possibly due to the stress of doing something she’s not used to, her evil side surfaces. Arahnia becomes rather reckless and then Sapphee and Tisalia do something to calm her down. Meanwhile, Glenn continues to visit Skadi every day to convince her to let him conduct the surgery. Skadi tries to say that this illness is her fate, but Glenn comes up with an unbelievable way to make her change her mind. Will she eventually agree to have the surgery?\nSource: crunchyroll",
