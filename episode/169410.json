  "description" : "Hayato left his \"wife\" Ui to sleep in his bed, setting up a futon for himself in the living room. He wakes up the next morning to find that Ui migrated to his futon in confusion after using the toilet that evening. He finds that she is not quite the same person in private as the \"perfect superwoman\" she appears to be in school. He makes her breakfast. His efforts to get her to \"go home\" to her own house are unavailing.\nIt appears that not everyone in the school is pleased with Ui`s platform of liberalising romance, most notably the school morals committee, led by Misumi Rin. Hayato attends cram school and is shocked to go home and find Ui apparently wearing nothing but an apron (she actually has a swimsuit underneath). She is trying to cook dinner but is hopelessly inadequate, so he helps her out. She has an accident, slipping and splashing hot water on herself, once again exposing her breasts.",
