  "description" : "Bunji Man is energetic even in the rain because of his \"Aqua Form,\" created from a garbage bag or supermarket bag. With this, one can freely play, even in the rain; Mom and Fumi are shopping in Ginza.  Unexpectedly, in the children`s clothes section of the department store, they run into Fumi`s rival, Kanna, and her mom.  As they are trying on clothes, the girls compete and Black Fumi and White Fumi appear; Fumi is frowning while they are having tea in the department store cafe with Kanna and her mom. Even here, a fierce battle over the menu begins between White Fumi and Black Fumi; Mom has finally finished work.  Or so she thinks when another deadline appears. Her brush doesn`t make any progress, as the only thing that does progress is time as she sleeps, plays, or just spaces out.\nSource: crunchyroll",
