  "description" : "Despite suffering a bad wound from Kikyo’s attacks, Irie desperately tries to fight back. He doesn’t even stop after their loss in Choice is declared. Tsuna sees his desperation and asks why he is so determined to defeat Byakuran. Irie responds by starting to speak about his relationship with Byakuran—something he has never talked about before. It all started ten years ago, when the young Irie and Lambo met, and Irie got the Ten-Year Bazooka’s bullet. Using the Ten-Year Bazooka’s bullet, the young Irie time-traveled to the future where he met Byakuran. There, something that Irie did made Byakuran realize his powers.\nSource: crunchyroll",
