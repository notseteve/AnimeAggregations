  "description" : "Itami`s group spends the night at his ex-wife`s home, and decide what to do next. He has the girls go out for a bit while he meets with the Minister of Defence, who is an old friend, and he is ordered to bring their guests to the Hakone Mountain resort that had been prepared for them and is guarded by elite Japanese special forces. Itami brings them there as ordered, and after they are settled there is fighting just outside as several groups of enemy commandos make their way to the resort. The Japanese special forces unit manages to neutralise most of these mysterious enemy forces. However, President Dirrell blackmails the Prime Minister with reports of government corruption and convinces him to get the unit guarding the resort to withdraw, so that the American commando unit can abduct the girls from the Special Region with no interference. Rory Mercury is heavily affected by the fighting outside the resort and tries to seduce Itami.",
