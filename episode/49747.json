  "description" : "During a fundraising campaign for the motor club where they attempt to fix vehicles, Keiichi`s Senpai, Ohtaki, helps out a young woman, Satoko, with her motor scooter, and ends up being attracted to her. Keiichi and Belldandy help Ohtaki ask Satoko out on a date. Toshiyuki Aoshima is not pleased about the date, after all Satoko is the University Director`s daughter. He attempts to foil the date and a meeting with Satoko`s father, but Ohtaki may have a bit of luck on his side thanks to Belldandy.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
