  "description" : "One hot summer night, as mosquitoes fill the air, the Shinsengumi immerse themselves in sharing scary tales. Inayama tells the tale of a female ghost dressed in a red kimono haunting the schoolhouse at midnight, only to find that the same ghost has appeared in the Shinsengumi station as well! More than half of the team falls victim to the ghost, each muttering about a woman dressed in red. Frightened by the unseen danger, Kondo decides to hire an exorcist to handle the situation. But these exorcists seem awfully shady-looking.\nSource: crunchyroll",
