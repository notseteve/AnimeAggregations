  "description" : "Elder Hamilton invents the bullet called the \"Spirit\" as his latest weapon, requesting Rosette and Chrono to deliver it to Sister Kate, but they are interrupted with another demon hunt mission. After having shot off the horn of the demon, Rosette promptly loses her gun containing the Spirit from her hand, as to when the demon approached and startled her. A suspicious man, the one responsible for obtaining the weapon, breaks into the convent, revealing himself as the same demon from before. The demon transforms recklessly by absorbing the aura of the Spirit. However, Chrono begins to transform after seeing Rosette tossed aside into the ground. Rosette later manages to calm Chrono down and is able to blast the demon. Elsewhere, Joshua Christopher slaughters a viscount under Aion, as Fiore Harvenheit, Joshua`s caretaker, witnesses the result of his massacre. \nSource: Wikipedia",
