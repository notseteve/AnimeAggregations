  "description" : "A mysterious person named Gennai appears as a hologram after a fight with Devimon and urges the group to travel to the continent of Server in order to defeat another enemy. Gennai also tells them about objects called Crests that will allow their Digimon to digivolve even further. They build a raft and leave File Island, but are soon swallowed up by Whamon who is still under the control of a Black Gear. After the gear is removed, Whamon takes the kids to where their Tags—the objects that the Crests are stored in—are hidden.\nSource: crunchyroll",
