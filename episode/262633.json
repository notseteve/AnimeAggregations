  "description" : "At the live performance, Akira is moved by the presence of Daiki, who looks like the main character of Akira`s favorite hero anime, \"Crossfire.\" Revved up, Akira and his group get inspired for their lessons, but the dance lessons particularly seem hopeless. Later, it`s decided that the three of them will get to participate in a commercial shoot as LEGIT`s backup dancers. Although there`s not much time before filming begins, LEGIT gives them one-on-one dance lessons. Akira, who fretfully practices yet makes little progress, begins feeling impatient and makes a proposal to Banri and Chihiro.\nSource: crunchyroll",
