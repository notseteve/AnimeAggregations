  "description" : "When Gan-chan expresses a wish to \"fly like the birds\", Skuld and Urd build him a series of progressively more complex flying machines, paralleling the history of flight. The devices begin with Urd`s attempt to build Icarus` wings, followed by Skuld constructing the Montgolfier brothers` balloon, Otto Lilienthal`s glider, Samuel Langley`s (unsuccessful) Aerodrome and, ultimately, the Bell X-1, as Belldandy gives the history of flight. However, Gan-chan is still unsatisfied and wishes to travel to space.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
