  "description" : "Irie is getting restless about the fact that he still doesn`t know where Tsuna is. Meanwhile, Tsuna is struggling with contact lenses. Tsuna cannot get them on. Reborn is astounded by how pathetic he is. Spanner suggests changing the material the contact is made of. He can complete it in under an hour, but Reborn says that it`s pointless to just wait. Spanner begins gathering Tsuna`s battle information using the simulator that he used to create King Moska`s battle program.\nSource: crunchyroll",
