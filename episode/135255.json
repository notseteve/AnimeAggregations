  "description" : "Masaru is Tagiru`s classmate and the son of the owner of a ramen shop, Katsuji, which has seen a significant decline in customers recently. Determined to help his classmate, Tagiru vows to make Katsuji into the kind of ramen shop that customers will line up to get into. But just when he`s about to take action, Katsuji`s ramen changes dramatically and people start to form a long line to eat it. Lurking behind this change are the shadows of Digimon called Ogremon and Fugamon! Ogremon and Fugamon have opened a ramen shop in the Digimon world, DigiQuartz, but since business is poor, they approach Katsuji, Masaru`s father and the owner of the ramen shop Katsuji. They agree to cooperate using Ogremon and Fugamon`s superb noodles with Katsuji`s prized soup. Katsuji`s shop thrives as a result. However, at the same time, Katsuji`s kind temperament changes and he begins to yell at customers. Wanting his kind father back, Masaru decides to make his own ramen to open his father`s eyes. What will happen when Tagiru and company stand by his side in this ramen face-off?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
