  "description" : "Isamu is smitten by Idol Zombie and badly wants to play guitar with her, terrorizing everyone within earshot with his ear-splitting awfulness, until Camera Zombie security puts an end to his aspirations and his guitar. Isamu’s hair is cursed into a bouffant after conjuring a dark spell in attempts to get back at Dark Zombie. Instead they conjure up Witch Zombie whose spell accidentally creates Muscle Monster from Zo Zo’s muscles, leaving no one safe in the forest. \nZo Zo becomes irritated after finding his entire snack machine at the mall missing, denying him of Choco-Donkeys. This causes the hangry Snowra to transform into a huge monster, and soon Zo Zo and his new friend Transfer Student Jay are running for their lives. Isamu is determined to out-prank master prankster, Uncle Zombo, but time after time the master schools the student. Finally, Isamu calls in expert: Snowman Zombie, who agrees to help Isamu and Zo Zo, but give them more than they bargained for.\nSource: crunchyroll",
