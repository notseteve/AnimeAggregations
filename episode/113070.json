  "description" : "In the battle at hand, they decide to implement the “target rule.” With this rule, the opposing teams each choose one person to be a target. Whichever team first defeats that target wins. Irie and Daisy are both chosen as targets. They wear target marks on their chests from which they can fire Deathperation Flames. Deathperation Flames are pure life energy. Even if the two targets are not directly hit by their enemies, using too much of their Deathperation Flames could lead to their death as well. Tsuna and the others are apprehensive, but Byakuran tells them with a cold smile that whoever’s Deathperation Flames first go out is the loser.\nSource: crunchyroll",
