  "description" : "Ichigo and his friends save a girl who is being attacked by mysterious Arrancars. The girl is also an Arrancar, named Nel, and as it turns out, she was only playing tag with her Arrancar friends, Pesche and Dondochakka. Nel and her friends are oddly cheery, but when they realize that Ichigo is a Soul Reaper, they worry that Aizen will scold them for letting their enemies roam freely.\nSource: crunchyroll",
