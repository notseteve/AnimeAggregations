  "description" : "Jotaro and the others visit an island on the Red Sea to visit someone. When they got to the island, they meet someone that looks just like Avdol, but with white hair... It was his father! However, it appears that he doesn`t want to speak to Jotaro and the others, and retreats into his house. Polnareff goes to the beach, reflecting on the sadness of the fact that Avdol died protecting him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
