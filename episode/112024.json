  "description" : "The Vongola Box training is done, and they just have to make their way to the spot Byakuran had chosen.  Reborn has suits made for the gang with Leon’s flame-resistant thread. These black suits are the Vongola’s uniform. Irie reminds Tsuna and the others that the future of the world depends on this battle. But the future of the world is a bit overwhelming to grasp, so Reborn tells Tsuna and his friends to just focus on fighting to bring peace back to Namimori. The gang heads off to the battle, motivated by Reborn’s words.\nSource: crunchyroll",
