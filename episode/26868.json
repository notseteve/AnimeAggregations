  "description" : "The last Quincy, who hates Soul Reapers —  Uryu Ishida, challenges Ichigo to a duel. He will scatter bait to lure Hollows to the town and the one \"who kills the most Hollows\" will win. Ichigo adamantly refuses, but is forced into the duel when Uryu scatters the bait and the Hollows converge on Karakura Town.  Since Hollows always seek out humans with strong spiritual energy, Ichigo hurries home, worried about his family. But his siblings are not the only targets.\nSource: crunchyroll",
