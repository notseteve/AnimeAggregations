  "description" : "While awaiting Amu to arrive, Su convinces Nikaidou to let her clean up the messy laboratory and make a fresh cup of coffee. While cleaning, Su discovers an old photo of Nikaidou when he was a boy and his mentor. Nikaidou recalls his dream of being a robotics professor and when his own Guardian Egg appeared. However, Nikaidou gave up his dream when his mentor retired due to his wife`s illness and Nikaidou`s Guardian Egg was broken. Amu arrives at the laboratory, fights a bunch of robots, rescues Su, and purifies all of the X Eggs that Nikaidou had collected. Nikaidou`s Guardian Egg reappears and his Guardian Character hatches. The Guardian Character greets Nikaidou, then disappears. Su tells Nikaidou that his \"would-be self\" can be renewed as many times as needed. Nikaidou stops working for Easter and discovers his mentor did not give up on his dream either.\nSource: crunchyroll",
