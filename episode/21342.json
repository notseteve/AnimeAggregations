  "description" : "Sherry and Brago are searching for a Mamodo in the snowy mountains. They come across an injured old man and his grandson, Jeff, who are being attacked by a bear. Sherry and Brago use their spell to scare the bear away and Brago then carries the man back to his house. The man explains that the bear killed the Jeff`s parents and they intended to get revenge with it. Brago leaves to wander around the mountain. Sherry`s butler comments that Brago has changed into a strict and kind person, a perfect king. Brago returns with the bear`s body and tells Jeff he must become a stronger person. The next day, a group of men threaten to bulldoze Jeff`s and his grandpa`s home. Brago defeats them and in vengeance, they detonate the explosives hidden in the mountain. An avalanche occurs but is stopped by Brago and his new spell \"Dioga Gravidon\".",
