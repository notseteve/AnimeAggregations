  "description" : "The dead heat between Midousuji and Naruko at the front of the race continues! Behind them Kuroda pulls as hard as he can, but the two in front of them remain out of sight. Saying \"Hakone Academy has nothing left to lose,\" Ashikiba, who had only been pulled until now, switches places with Kuroda and begins his Metronome Dancing. They are rapidly closing the gap. Imaizumi also pedals as hard as he can so he can support Naruko. Midousuji, Naruko, Kuroda, Ashikiba, and Imaizumi... The time has come for these five men who have steeled their resolve to settle the score!\nSource: crunchyroll",
