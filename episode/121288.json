  "description" : "The long battle in the future finally comes to an end. However, the group has suffered some major losses. Tsuna begins to have doubts that this devastating battle was as important as he had thought. Just then, the Arcobaleno comes up with a way to bring everything back to normal with the information they received from Yuni’s flames. With this solution, Byakuran’s evil doings would be erased from the past. Not only that, the past in which people perished at the hands of Byakuran would be changed so that their lives would not be lost. A new past would be born, and it would lead to a brighter future.\nSource: crunchyroll",
