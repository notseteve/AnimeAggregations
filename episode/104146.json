  "description" : "Mom wrote about strange foods that aren`t normally eaten in Japan in her manga when one day, Bunji wants to eat something that`s unthinkable; Even though they heard that you become a fool if you eat sweets, Bunji and Fumi still want to eat them; Fumi makes up a story and tells it at home and at school. Mom was concerned about this so she asks Fumi why she created a story and was surprised to hear her answer; On occasion, Mom will go out at night with those she knows from work as her reward where she gets pretty drunk. However, looking at the faces of Bunji and Fumi while they are asleep is really the biggest reward.\nSource: crunchyroll",
