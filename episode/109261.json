  "description" : "A pair of usurping invaders show up on Earth to take the invasion away from the Keroro Platoon.  But they are accidentally foiled by Hinata Aki.  Afterwards, Aki can`t make it to Open Day at Natsumi`s school, so Kululu shows up in her stead.  He seems to be behaving oddly well, but... surely he must have something up his sleeve?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
