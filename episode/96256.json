  "description" : "The next morning is awkward for Yoichi as he tries to adjust to the Ikaruga household, and even more awkward when he transfers into school. Ibuki harshly admonishes him several times for strange behaviour that could be misinterpreted. The punk he defeated yesterday, named Washizu, goes to the same school, and challenges him to a duel, where he is again soundly defeated. When they get home Yoichi is struck by a sudden fever from the stress of trying to adjust so quickly to the modern world, and Ibuki goes out to get some groceries. Meanwhile, in uncharacteristic kindness Ayame tries to make rice porridge for him, which she does with Kagome`s help. Later, Ibuki returns and she apologises to Yoichi for her harshness and Yoichi does the same for his recklessness.",
