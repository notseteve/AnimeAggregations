  "description" : "Egon Weissbach was one of the first investigators in the murder of the Liebert parents. On his last day on the job before retirement, he is escorting a convicted serial murderer but wants to know why he killed someone who did not fit his modus operandi. At the same time, Dr. Gillen is interviewing several murderers wondering why they killed someone who also did not fit their usual targets. Both realize that all these criminals committed murders outside their usual scope at the request of a young man, presumably Johan.\n[I]Source: theTVDB.com[/I]",
