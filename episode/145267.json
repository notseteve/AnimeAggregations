  "description" : "Arriving at the top of the World Tree, Kirito and Yui finally reunite with Asuna. However, they are suddenly hit by high gravity magic, which forces Yui to retreat, and are confronted by Oberon. As Oberon reveals his plans to control the human mind is almost complete, he chains Asuna up and starts to molest her in front of Kirito, who is stabbed into the ground by him. As Kirito falls into despair, he hears the voice of Akihiko, who encourages him to stand up and fight, realising the pain is nothing compared to the pain of SAO. Using Akihiko`s administrative functions, Kirito removes all of Oberon`s powers and challenges him to a fight with no pain absorption, showing him what true pain is before he finally destroys Oberon. After logging Asuna out to ensure her safety in the real world, Kirito meets with the remnant of Akihiko`s memory, who gives him an item called \"The Seed\" before leaving. After returning to the real world and giving his thanks to Suguha, Kazuto makes his way to the hospital to reunite with Asuna.\nSource: Wiki",
