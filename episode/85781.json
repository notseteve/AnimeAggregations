  "description" : "In the depths of Las Noches, Rukia encounters Ninth Espada Aaroniero Arruruerie in an area with a blue sky. Aaroniero lures Rukia into a room and removes his mask. Underneath his mask is the face of Kaien Shiba, the former Thirteenth Squad Lieutenant who is supposed to be dead. Rukia is confused, but Kaien talks with her as if nothing happened. Kaien explains that because of the ability of the Hollow that took control of him right before he died, he was thrust into Hueco Mundo, where he was reborn.\nSource: crunchyroll",
