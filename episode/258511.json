  "description" : "When Finn was young, his family lived in a slum where garbage tended to be dumped. One day, his brother brings him an older model of Deco that should be easier for Finn to use due to his Deco-Sickness. With it, Finn accidentally discovers that the local purification systems are broken. Believing this is what has caused his home to become polluted, he uses the Deco that he got from his brother to request that the customer center fix the purification system. But because he isn`t registered as a citizen, his login is flagged as illegal, which leads to his request not being answered.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
