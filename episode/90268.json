  "description" : "Kukai comes back to visit the Guardians. He notices that Amu is feeling down, so he decides to ask her what is wrong. As they talk, they encounter Utau. Utau shows Amu that she has Amu`s diamond egg. Utau tries to goad Amu into a fight, but Amu refuses. With the power of the Humpty Lock, El does a Character Transformation with Amu, becoming Amulet Angel, and Kukai does a Character Transformation with Daichi, becoming Sky Jack. Diamond hatches from her X-egg and does a Character Transformation with Utau, becoming Dark Jewel. Nevertheless, Amu`s and Utau`s Character Transformations do not last long and they are both exhausted. Ikuto appears and apologizes to Amu for Utau`s actions. Utau becomes furious that Ikuto is taking Amu`s side and forcefully kisses him twice. Ikuto gets angry, and tells Utau to stop because they are siblings, to the surprise of Amu and Kukai.\nSource: crunchyroll",
