Growing bigger than all the other dogs, Biriken starts to punish them, and becomes the boss of all stray mutts. But he becomes a puppy again with a red candy only when he goes back home to his mother and acts like a baby with her. The mother starts to teach the spoiled Biriken how to become strong. But after knowing that he can be strong with the power of the candies, Biriken no longer listens to his mother. \nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
