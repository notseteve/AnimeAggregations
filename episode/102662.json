  "description" : "The SOS Brigade`s website has been created, but it is composed of little more than the club logo. Coincidentally, the SOS Brigade gets their first case after the website goes up — they are to find the missing Computer Research Society President. Upon going to his apartment, they find that he is not there, and nothing seems too out of the ordinary on the surface. After the Brigade leaves, the members, excluding Haruhi, return to the apartment where they find that Haruhi`s SOS Brigade logo and a Data Entity are behind the disappearance.",
