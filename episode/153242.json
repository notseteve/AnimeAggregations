  "description" : "Jun is left looking at what remains of Shinku, and is left with deep regret at having ever chosen not to wind the key in the first place. His younger self who originally did choose to wind the key rushes to the tragic scene, carrying what Suigintou identifies as Shinku`s doll case. Jun who didn`t wind the key is now faced with the careful task of reassembling poor Shinku, so that she may return to a life with the Jun who wound the key, and so that he may gain the confidence to live his own life as well.\nSource: crunchyroll",
