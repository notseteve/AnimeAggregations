  "description" : "The time to settle the battle for the official fan club title is finally here. The match between Shinpachi and Hijikata is a card battle using Otsu chip playing cards. Never knowing such a thing existed, Shinpachi rushes to the vendor for some cards. Hijikata on the other hand is fully prepared and delivers the ultra powerful card “Melancholy 5-minutes before start”! Hijikata’s range of powerful attacks forces Shinpachi to stay on the defensive. Can he possibly find a way to make a counterattack?\nSource: crunchyroll",
