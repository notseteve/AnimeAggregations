The castle is, however, already surrounded by Shoko’s soldiers and the State Army’s main force is arriving soon.  Suzu sends Asano to get Kantai’s help in Meikaku but he gets stopped by Summer Officers.  When the rebels try to force their way out of the castle at dawn, the strong State’s cavalries strike.  Then, Kantai’s force arrives to help them.  It turns out that Kantai has a bigger plan than arresting Shoko.\nSource: crunchyroll",
