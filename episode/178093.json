  "description" : "Tsukushi and Kazama, along with all the other first years who joined the soccer club, are forced to run outer laps as a collective punishment. As Tsukushi does not want to be a bother to the others, he asks the captain Mizuki Hisahito for permission to run everybody`s laps by himself. Seeing Tsukushi continue to run relentlessly, fueled by nothing but the pure sentiment of “I want to play soccer with everyone\", the other first years are inspired to join him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
