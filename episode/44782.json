  "description" : "It`s the day of the big track meet. Captain Miyamoto is concerned that even though Yamato`s sprinting style has adjusted, Yamato`s times haven`t really improved enough. But Yamato is all psyched to face Arima in the preliminaries, which come to a shocking conclusion 11 seconds or so later. Suzuka visits Yamato to boil some extra eggs (about the only thing she can cook), and Yamato picks up that she might be caring for him, and uses that opportunity to try one last confession.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
