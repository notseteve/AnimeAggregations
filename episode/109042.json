Ultimately, Tsuna, who has defeated his nemesis, the Phantom Knight, comes across a white and round device. The astonishing truth that Irie informed them about awaits them there. The battle at the Merone Base comes to an end at the moment, and Tsuna passes another test, thereby acquiring the power to open the Vongola Box. However, whether he’ll be able to use it well all depends on his next training session. His next goal is to defeat Byakuran…! They venture off to their next battle to bring back peace and return to Namimori of 10 years earlier.\nSource: crunchyroll",
