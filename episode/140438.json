  "description" : "A woman named Y who supposedly works in researching the Human Monument manages to find a disc full of data inside an old mansion, which turns out to be a volume of a yaoi manga. She soon gets into the habit of publishing yaoi manga which she distributes across the country. When the fairies catch wind of the trend and start publishing their own yaoi manga, Y begins to work harder to compete, bringing about a manga renaissance. However, her manga becomes too heavy that the couriers do not want to deliver the boxes themselves, leading her to create a dōjin fair. Some time later, the heroine discovers a mysterious dōjin which traps her and Y inside a blank panel.",
