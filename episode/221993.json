  "description" : "Emperor Friedrich IV of the Galactic Empire has suddenly passed away without naming a successor. Edwin Josef, the son of the late prince and the emperor`s only surviving direct descendant, is only five years old. The Braunschweig and Littenheim families, into which the emperor`s daughters had married, begin scheming to install their respective daughters as the new empress. Thus begins the battle for the throne between the families who serve as guardians to the emperor`s three grandchildren. Reinhard has not sided with any of them yet, so a certain influential power seeks to take advantage of his military strength.\nSource: crunchyroll",
