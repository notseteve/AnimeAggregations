  "description" : "Narumi’s new to Tokyo and it doesn’t take him long to get lost in the big city. He somehow manages to stumble into the red district, where he sees a girl jump out of a second-floor window. A group of teenagers help her and her friend, but no one is open to answering any of Narumi’s questions.  The next day at school Ayaka, one of Narumi’s classmates, forces him to join her Garden Club. After school she takes him over to a ramen shop, where she introduces him to her friends—the same guys he saw the other day! Apparently they’re a group of NEETs that like to help out the NEET detective, Alice.  Alice has received a request to put an end to a prostitution spree, but before she can do that she must find a prostitute that has gone missing. Somehow the girl Narumi saw jump out of the window is related to the case. Can Narumi help Alice find the girl before this case gets carried away?",
