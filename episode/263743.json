  "description" : "Due to the risk that Code might attempt to kill Boruto and Kawaki, guards are assigned to them. Boruto is sick of being watched every day. Meanwhile, Kawaki overhears a conversation between Shikadai and Inojin and learns how to slip past his guard and the Village’s sensory system. Once he decides he must do whatever it takes to protect Naruto and the Hidden Leaf, he jumps into action. Despite their keen sensory abilities, Naruto and the Village’s sensory team are unaware of what’s happening. But Boruto feels a strange sensation that allows him to detect Kawaki’s movements.\nSource: crunchyroll",
