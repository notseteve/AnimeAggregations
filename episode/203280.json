  "description" : "Jashin-chan`s voice echoes throughout Jinbocho, \"Lost again, damn it!\" She lost the grocery money by playing the slots and is desperate to make Medusa lend her more. Infuriated, Yurine swings her morning star, \"I`ve no choice but to kill you.\" Turns out Jashin-chan`s addicted to social-network games too. As Halo-less Poporon and the Ogre of Setsubun appears, Jashin-chan finds herself in a loop.\nSource: Amazon",
