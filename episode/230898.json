  "description" : "After dying to Elsa`s blade in Roswaal`s mansion, Subaru awakens back in the graveyard, in the moment immediately after he passed the trial that required him to face his past. Just like the first time he returned there, he wakes Emilia and holds her to comfort her, then returns to Ryuzu and the others. He tells them that he passed the trial himself and suggests that he could complete the remaining stages of the trial in Emilia`s place, but Garfiel is opposed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
