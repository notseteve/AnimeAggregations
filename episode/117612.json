  "description" : "Joey`s group is forced to retreat from the new enemies that suddenly appear in front of them. Meanwhile, Prof. Denton has analyzed the Skrugg and determined that the five spheres are heading toward different important world cities. One of them is the White House itself. At first thought to just be rolling spheres, it seems the Skrugg studied humanity well on how exactly to destroy the entire world. Realizing this, everyone is shocked and itching to do something about it, and as the time limit approaches, Joey and his friends become determined to head toward the enemy`s base.\nSource: crunchyroll",
