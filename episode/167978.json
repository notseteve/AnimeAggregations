  "description" : "The next day is Kagami`s first day as a teacher in Hiiragi Academy, and Suzune has to push him into going. He sees Kiriko at the gates, still trying in vain to keep her identity as Cutter Girl a secret, when a car comes flying in their direction, kicked by the monstrous Nanami Seijuurou, a violent bully whom he later nicknames `Cyborg` (改造人間, kaizou ningen) who won`t let anyone get in his way. As Nanami tries to beat up a younger student who has a figurine of Kagami`s favourite anime character on his phone for bumping into him, Kagami intervenes, and is nearly beaten up himself but Suzune saves him. Hiiragi prevents the fight between them from escalating into blows, and makes Kagami and Nanami have a duel in three days.\nAfter learning about Nanami`s past from his former student Minako, Kagami initially makes Nanami think that their duel will be a game of computer soccer, but it turns out that he intended their game to be actual soccer with the school teams.",
