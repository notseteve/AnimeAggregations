  "description" : "It`s been about a month since the start of the school year, and the theater society is practicing as always when Hinako notices child in the room. Kuina comments that the child has been showing up for a few days. None of the other members seem to mind that there`s a child among them; in fact, they all seem to be practicing harder than usual. Since the child is next to Chiaki, Hinako and Kuina wonder if she`s a theater troupe relation, or perhaps even Chiaki`s daughter. Finally, Yua can`t stand to listen anymore and straightens them out.\nSource: crunchyroll",
