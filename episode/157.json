  "description" : "Yoko Nakajima is an A student at high school but feels isolated in class and at home.  She constantly suffers from a nightmare about unfamiliar sights and dreadful monsters.  One day, a blond hair boy, Keiki, shows up at school and tells Yoko that she’s the “master” he’s been looking for.  Yoko is confused but monsters attack school and she has to fight them with Keiki’s servants and sword.  She also gets her friends, Asano and Sugimoto, involved.  She passes out but wakes up in a giant whirlpool of light where Keiki’s servant flies her to “the other side.”\nSource: crunchyroll",
