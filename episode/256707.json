  "description" : "Returning from her normal morning run, Young Wai-Wai member Takahashi Yomogi finds an ema—a votive horse plaque used to make wishes at shrines—dropped at the entrance to the Takako-so. When she shows the plaque to Yayoi and Yuzu, they notice a menacing wish written on the back: \"tonight 8 o`clock head of state assassination.\" Realizing that the president of the United States is visiting Japan that day, and convinced that one of other Takako-so residents must be plotting a crime, the three decide to uncover whoever is responsible and try to talk them out of it. Will they be able to identify the suspect and foil the assassination plot in time?\nSource: crunchyroll",
