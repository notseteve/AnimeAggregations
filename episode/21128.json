  "description" : "Dororo`s arm gets caught in a fishing-trap when she is bathing at the riverside. Hyakkimaru finds her asking for help, and goes to a nearby temple to borrow a tool to loosen the trap. The chief priest of the temple willingly lends him the tool, but Hyakkimaru senses something odd about the priest. When he returns to the river, Dororo is gone. Taking it to be the doing of the chief priest Shikanyudo, he challenges him to a fight. In fact, the priest was buried alive by a warrior for refusing to surrender the temple, and later turned into a demon. Then the spirit got mixed with the spirits of mice, weasels and moles, finally turning into a monster. After killing the monster, Hyakkimaru puts the priest`s spirit to rest with respect.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
