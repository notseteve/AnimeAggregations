  "description" : "Today is graduation day, and Sayuri is reflecting on the past year with everyone she`s met at Fleurir. Ryou-kun was scary at first, but he had passion and a kind heart. Mitsuki-sensei taught her a great deal, both inside and outside classes. Gilbert-sensei gave everyone energy with his bright smile and cheerful nature. Yoshinosuke-sensei had a cool exterior, but always offered his caring support. Not to mention all her unique schoolmates... Sayuri found a lifelong treasure in her time at Fleurir.\nSource: crunchyroll",
