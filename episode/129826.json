  "description" : "Rintaro explains the nature of the World Line shift to Daru and Kurisu and how he is the only one who can remember its changes, an ability he refers to as \"Reading Steiner\". As the experiments resume, Moeka requests to send a D-Mail, which shifts Rintaro to a new World Line where no one else remembers Moeka. The next day, Ruka comes to the lab, asking to send a D-Mail to before he was born so that he would be born as a girl. Using an urban myth about how a diet can affect a baby`s gender before birth, the group send a D-Mail to Ruka`s mother`s pager, sending Rintaro to another world line, although he doesn`t notice any obvious changes. \nSource: Wikipedia",
