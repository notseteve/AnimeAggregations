  "description" : "The night that the Harvest Festival ended, the instructors of Babyls got together at a pub to celebrate. Kalego usually never goes to these outings, but Balam catches him and forces him to go. Robin is getting ahead of himself as usual and the group even talks about Kalego`s days as a newbie instructor. What is the most important thing about being an instructor at Babyls? We also get to see what happened to Ocho after he escaped into the jungle after the Harvest Festival.\nSource: crunchyroll",
