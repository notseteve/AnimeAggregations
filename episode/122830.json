  "description" : "An epidemic in which people`s bodily fluids are turning blue spreads across Tokyo, and the JSDF suspects that the Arc Station is causing it and puts Tony under watch. He is approached by Sakurai who informs him that a satellite has been taken over by a Zodiac warrior, which is causing the radiation. Meanwhile, Nanami also gets sick from the radiation. Using an experimental coating to protect him from the radiation, Iron Man launches into space with the help of Sakurai to face the Zodiac. However, he is at a disadvantage in zero gravity and is taken inside where he is exposed to high radiation. However, Iron Man manages to send the radiation data back to Earth so they can cure the victims, and break free from the Zodiac and destroy it.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
