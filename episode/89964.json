  "description" : "Geez, Irie-kun`s mama is really determined. Kotoko-chan and her friends have made plans to go to Waterland and (only thinking about Kotoko and Irie-kun`s future) she sends Yuki and Irie to Waterland just to try to get Kotoko and Irie into a romantic situation. Yeah I know, but anyways on their little trip Yuki tries to observe Kotoko at bit closer, so he asks Irie to go get him some ice-cream. While Irie`s out, to get Yuki`s ice-cream, Yuki switches from the part of the pool where he can stand on the floor, to the part of the pool where Kotoko and her friends are (where he can`t stand). Right when he lets go of the ladder he starts to sink because he can`t touch the bottom. Right after he becomes unconscious Kotoko saves him. During that time, Irie overhears these two girls about a little kid who almost drowned. Next, after he heard he hurried off without the ice-cream to see if Yuki is okay. When he finally gets Kotoko and the others, he realizes that Kotoko took very good care of Yuki, so he just stands there and smiles. Soon after that Kotoko decides to take everyone to the waterslides and when it`s her turn to go, down she goes. Once she starts going down, she gets a leg cramp, which paralyzes her so she can`t move. Once she gets to the bottom of the waterslide, Irie notices that she`s having a hard time getting out, so he pulls her up and out of the water just in time, and gives her foot a relaxing foot rub.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
