According to Mana, lots of adults besides Masashi`s father are asleep. Daddy Eyeball speculates that the adults might be being held in the world of dreams by yokai. Kitaro and the others go to the Pillow Turner, but the Pillow Turner was not the one doing it. Mana manages to prod the Pillow Turner, and Kitaro and the others enter the world of dreams through the Pillow Turner`s arts. It`s a place where anything you imagine can become reality. Mana and Cat-girl soon become absorbed in their dream worlds.\nSource: crunchyroll",
