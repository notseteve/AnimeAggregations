  "description" : "The city council decided to do a Sunday Scavenger Hunt! Sakura wanted me to be her partner, but when I wouldn`t be able to film her... It all worked out though, since Sakura got to be partners with Yukito instead. To finish the hunt, each team had to answer riddles and find a special tile. Sakura and Yukito are so smart that they solved them all and went to look for the tile in the woods. Sakura almost got hurt falling off a cliff, but Yukito saved her and got hurt instead... Still, even though he was injured, they eventually made their way to the finish line, where we were all waiting for them!\nSource: crunchyroll",
