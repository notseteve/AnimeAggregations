  "description" : "The dubbing sessions for the second cour of the anime Chitose and the others star in has started. It didn`t really do well in sales, but somehow the project is continuing. Considering everything that went wrong, rather than being down in the dumps, the staff and cast seemed mysteriously hopeful... except for Chitose. Chitose had come to believe she had made it as a popular voice actress and she feels untouchable. To make matters worse, a newbie at her agency, Sakuragaoka Nanami, tells her how much she idolizes her, inflating her head even more.\nSource: crunchyroll",
