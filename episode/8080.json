Unfortunately, Arbormon & Grumblemon figured out where they were and decided to wage another attack. Grumblemon unleashed an angry horde of Golemon and it looked like the Digidestined were doomed. Then Whamon blasted Grumblemon and coughed up a Spirit that he had accidentally munched before being sucked into the cave. J.P. Beast Spirit Evolved into the mighty Warrior, MetalKabuterimon, and wiped out the grouchy Grumblemon once and for all!\nSource: crunchyroll",
