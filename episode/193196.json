  "description" : "A customer of Café Stile confesses his affection to Mafuyu. However, not only is there a considerable height difference between them, but the gap between the character she plays for the customers and her true self is so wide that Mafuyu goes immediately into rejection mode. Mafuyu’s little brother, on the other hand, worries that his sister will never have a boyfriend. Meanwhile, when Kaho’s string of failing marks at school has prompted her mother to ban all video games unless she can get an average score or higher on a big makeup test, Mafuyu agrees to supervise Kaho’s study sessions.\nSource: crunchyroll",
