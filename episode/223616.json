  "description" : "Something is causing groups of people to mysteriously age, and each of the victims used a rejuvination cream labelled \"Beauty B Beauty.\" To try to bring the situation under control, Kitaro and the others head to the island where the youkai Nuppeppou is manufacturing the cream. But as soon as they land, they hear a strange song and their bodies begin to age. As they stand there bewildered, the Sand-throwing Hag starts behaving strangely. Though she pretends to know nothing, a jar of \"Beauty B Beauty\" cream falls out of her sleeve! What is Nuppeppou trying to accomplish? And what will happen to the Sand-throwing Hag...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
