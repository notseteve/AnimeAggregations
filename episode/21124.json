  "description" : "A huge tree that is over 2000 years old is going to be cut down because it was hampering the construction of a fortress. Hyakkimaru happens to be there, and he senses something very strange coming from the huge tree. While it is not unusual for old trees to have spirits dwelling in them, this huge tree seems to have something evil about it. A woodcutter tries to drive his axe into the tree, saying that he senses nothing, but Hyakkimaru stops him and tries to cut the tree with his sword. Then his arm, with the sword, is swallowed into the tree. Dororo is stunned to see her big brother being eaten by the tree!\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
