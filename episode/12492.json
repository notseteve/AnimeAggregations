  "description" : "Yuta and Mana fall off a cliff chasing a butterfly. Mana is unconscious, but Yuta dies. A heavily bandaged man, Big Eyes, as nearby villagers call him, carries Mana to his cave. An old hunter from the village finds Yuta, but Yuta revives during his burial rites. That night when Mana awakens, Big Eyes tells her that she is safe. The next morning Big Eyes tells Mana that long ago he lived in a fishing village. He ate mermaid flesh, blacked out, and, regaining his senses, discovered everyone in his village had been killed. He ran into the mountains and had lived alone ever since. When Yuta and the hunter find Mana and Big Eyes, Big Eyes flees with Mana deep into the cave. There Mana stumbles upon the skeletons of villagers that Big Eyes has eaten. Big Eyes explains that he still blacks out. When the hunter shoots Big Eyes, Big Eyes goes berserk and runs away. Yuta catches and kills Big Eyes. Mana ponders that there are all sorts of Deformed Ones, all sorts of mermaids, and all sorts of Yutas.\nSource: Wiki",
