  "description" : "Having received intelligence from the regular forces, a team of three GN-X types are standing by in the jungle, seeking clues to the location of a private armed organization`s base. Then suddenly, they detect an enemy transport container on their sensors. The GN-X team immediately begin pursuit, but a Cherudim Gundam SAGA emerges from the container and bars their way. Two GN-X units engage the deployed Cherudim Gundam SAGA, while the remaining one continues pursuing the transport container, eventually discovering an enemy base concealed by optical camouflage. But what appears there is a huge opponent, with light glowing from every part.",
