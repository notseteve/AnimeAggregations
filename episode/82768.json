  "description" : "Toraji \"Kojirou\" Ishida, the coach of the Muroe High kendo club, makes a bet with his senpai, Kenzaburou Ishibashi, the coach of the Machido High kendo club, on a practice match between both schools, but the fighters must be five girls, no boys. Toraji`s victory would mean he could eat all he wants at Ishibashi`s father`s sushi restaurant for a full year. Toraji desperately needs to find more talented female kendo students because he only has the team captain in his club, Kirino Chiba. With only a month remaining before his team`s match with Ishibashi`s team, he meets an extremely talented freshman, Tamaki Kawazoe.\nSource: Wiki",
