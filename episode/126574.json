As Kyousuke prepares to go home he receives a text message from Kirino telling him to throw away her collection of eroge and anime goods! Kyousuke contacts Ayase who confirms Kirino hasn`t been in contact with her since she left either. Kyousuke then meets up with Ruri who encourages him to fly to America to find the root of Kirino`s problem - and before the boy leaves she puts a special jinx on him.",
