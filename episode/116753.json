Worried about Koume`s recent behavior, the concerned Tomoyuki has come to the kindergarten to see how she has been doing. When Tsuchida-sensei learns her concerns are related to the footrace at the upcoming field day, he finds someone to help her.\nAt the Hanamaru Kindergarten teachers` get-together, Tsuchida-sensei hits it off with Yamamoto-sensei while Kusano-sensei and Nishikaze-sensei listen to Kakogawa-sensei ramble, and the kindhearted kindergarten director watches over the tipsy teachers. After the get-together, Tsuchida-sensei, Yamamoto-sensei, Kusano-sensei, and Kawashiro-sensei go to karaoke.\nSource: crunchyroll",
