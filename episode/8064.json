So Cherubimon corrupted him with more dark memories of his past to turn him against Koji. Meanwhile, Zoe, Tommy and J.P. tried to contact the others about the Rose Morning Star, where Ophanimon was being held captive. Bokomon and Neemon went and found Patamon but they also found Takuya as well. Unfortunately, Velgemon showed up and revealed to Koji his secrets and made him afraid of attacking his brother which gave Velgemon the upper hand.
