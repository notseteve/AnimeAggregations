  "description" : "Everyone in our class got to go camping by the seaside, where we all took part in a test of courage. Sakura was terribly afraid, and even clung to me as we headed into the cave. She scremed in terror when she saw our teacher dressed up as a ghost but then something even weirder happened- people started to disappear! It turned out to be the Erase card, and it erased almost everyone from the area- even me! But then Xiaolang showed up, and with his help, Sakura was finally able to seal the card away.\nSource: crunchyroll",
