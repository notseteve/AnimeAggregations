  "description" : "Though the concert ended without incident, Riku was unable to perform in the encore due to an asthma attack. Fortunately, it doesn`t affect the Zero Arena general manager`s opinion of the concert, and IDOLiSH7 is officially offered an appearance at the inaugural concert. Mitsuki and Nagi are delighted, but there are reservations about whether or not the sickly Riku can continue acting as the center. Riku tries to act tough after his recovery, making Tsumugi wonder how to approach the situation. Meanwhile, she discusses a major decision with Iori.\nSource: crunchyroll",
