Bianchi says that Chrome just doesn’t know how to respond to the kindness of Kyoko and Haru, but their concerns continue to grow. Urged by Reborn and Kyoko, Tsuna decides to check up on Chrome. Chrome opens the door for Tsuna, but when Gokudera comes near, she immediately closes it again. Alone in her room, Chrome stays tucked in her futon.
