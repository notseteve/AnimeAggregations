  "description" : "Irie explains the rules of the game, Choice, to Tsuna and the crew. It is a war game in which one gets to choose opponents and battlefields. The winner gets to take one thing from the loser’s belongings. Irie and Byakuran originally came up with Choice as a board game during their college days, and it has since then developed into a computer game. But how exactly is the computer game played? There are still a lot of things that are unclear. However, what is known at this stage is that they will need the ability to move about large battlefields. According to Reborn’s plan, Giannini and Spanner face off for the first time.\nSource: crunchyroll",
