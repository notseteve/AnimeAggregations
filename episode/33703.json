  "description" : "Kukaku Shiba, the one who knows how to get into Soul Society is Rokongai`s top pyrotechnist.  Furthermore, she is the older sister of Ganju, who appeared the previous night on a boar.  Kukaku explains how she will get them into Soul Society.  She will gather their spiritual energy and form it into a giant ball and fire it like a cannon into the skies over Soul Society.  Although it sounds ridiculous, the entourage prepare to create a giant cannonball of spiritual energy.  And Ganju, it seems, has a grudge against Soul Reapers.\nSource: crunchyroll",
