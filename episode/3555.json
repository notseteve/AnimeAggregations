  "description" : "The Clow Cards that Sakura hadn`t changed were starting to get cold, and Kero said that it was because they would become normal cards soon. Since Sakura wanted to save them, she tried transforming all of them at once, but it was too much for her. The Dash card didn`t finish being transformed, and escaped! She chased it down and cleverly used the Loop card to finally catch Dash. After Dash`s escape and wild behavior, I think Sakura realized that she needed to be more careful with her magic.\nSource: crunchyroll",
