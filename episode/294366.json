The three girls happily accept, thinking it`s the perfect event for the Cinephoto Club, but they find out they`ll be going around shops that serve generous portions of food to the point they`ll be full! They`re disappointed in the food brought to them, but this is just the beginning of their fight.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
