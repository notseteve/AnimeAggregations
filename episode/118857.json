  "description" : "Ringo and Saotome are having an argument. When Ringo says that “My father’s apple pies are the best in the world”, Saotome replies that being the best is not that easy. Ringo counters by saying that her father ‘s are still the best, so Saotome ups the ante by saying that he will accept her claim if her father wins the apple pie contest. After Ringo gets back, she immediately asks her father to participate in the apple pie contest. However, no matter how many times she implores him, he won’t agree to participate. On the next day, when Ringo tells her friends that her father won’t compete, Saotome shows up and starts another argument. He claims that Ringo’s father had no confidence and ran. So Ringo can’t help herself and says that her “Father will definitely compete!”.\nSource: crunchyroll",
