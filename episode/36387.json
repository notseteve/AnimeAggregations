  "description" : "Mayama continues to battle over his feelings for Rika and his feelings for Yamada. Meanwhile, Hagu is overwhelmed by other people`s expectations of her artistic ability. The next day, Morita invites Takemoto, Mayama, Hagu, Professor Hanamoto, and Yamada to a Christmas party. Takemoto and Hagu go Christmas shopping, and it is revealed that Takemoto does not really like Christmas. Mayama visits Rika and learns that she is going out with Professor Hanamoto. The night of the Christmas party comes, and everyone has a good time. Mayama arrives late, and the party has become a little crazy. Mayama steps out to meet Professor Hanamoto, and asks where Rika is. Professor Hanamoto replies that she is at her husband`s, meaning that Rika is visiting the grave of her husband. Hagu interrupts their conversation, and Mayama and Professor Hanamoto join the party. At the end of the party, Mayama stays to clean up, and Professor Hanamoto takes everyone else home. Mayama stands by the window and thinks wistfully of Rika, and then Yamada. Morita startles Mayama out of his reverie, and the two drink. Takemoto is asleep, dreaming of a happy Christmas with himself and Hagu.\nSource: Wikipedia",
