There, Reborn gives him a mafia suit modeled based on the Namimori Middle School uniform made specially by Leon. Tsuna puts on the suit and heads to Namimori Middle School, where the Sky Ring battle is being held. His Guardians gather there one-by-one. Tsuna is surprised that Hibari is there but it seems that the Cervello have forced everyone to assemble. Tsuna is angered that they take Lambo from the hospital.
