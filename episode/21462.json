But when closely examined, it is found to actually be comprised of a mass of unknown chemical substances and not an island at all. Nina receives a mysterious message on the island from a different human race, called \"Hypocra,\" which supposedly became extinct 20,000 years ago. The Hypocras are attempting to take revenge on humans, who ruined them by using this island. Everything touched by the black smoke rising from the island freezes instantly. Monsters come forth from the island and attack the world as it freezes land by land. Akira turns into Big X and to get the crisis under control.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
