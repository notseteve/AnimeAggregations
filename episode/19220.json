  "description" : "A beautiful pianist comes to Tokyo for a charity concert, and City Hunter is there. But music isn`t his forte-Joe wants lessons in the language of love. Typically, though, things don`t go his way. A foreign dignitary is assassinated in cold blood; secret agents scour the streets for a missing microchip; and diplomatic infighting swirls around the upcoming concert-until Nina the pianist and her grandfather Klaus are kidnapped. A maelstrom of exploding grenades, the rumble of Falcon`s jeep, and the tinkling of the ivories all set the stage for City Hunter: 357 Magnum. The show must go on!\nSource: crunchyroll",
