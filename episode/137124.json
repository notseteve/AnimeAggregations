  "description" : "With Johan freed from the Midnight Lost Child, Shana and her allies continue their fight against Yuji and the Crimson Denizens. The Flame Haze Earnest attempts to contact The Oracle through Rofocale who informs him that to summon the Oracle is impossible; at least until he has a vision which startles him. On the other hand, Shana`s attacks brings out Yuji`s very own unrestricted spell through Snake of the Festival. To the leader of Bal Masque`s fear however, she manages to fire multiple Chorde into the egg of the New World, possibly damaging it.\nSource: Wiki",
