  "description" : "The short describes a day in the life of Slowking. It starts when Slowking wakes up at dawn in his cave overlooking the three small islands close to Shamouti Island. Slowking goes down to the beach and uses his psychic abilities to grab a coconut for breakfast, opening it by banging it on the shell on his head. He then takes a walk around the shrine where the climactic scene of The Power of One took place, and stops to smell the flowers that surround it on the cliff. Yawning, Slowking then crawls onto a rock in the middle of the flower field and takes an afternoon nap. After a while, a Butterfree passes by as Slowking wakes up. Commenting on how good the weather is, Slowking walks to the edge of the cliff, stretches, and jumps into the ocean to swim. In the water, he meets and greets his good friend, a Seel. Eventually Slowking leaves the ocean with a lot of seafood, and eats it while sitting on the cliff and watching the sunset. As many stars shine in the sky, Slowking returns to his cave and falls asleep.",
