  "description" : "The audience at the Yoshino Tournament is taken for a wild ride with so many unexpected twists: Arata, the focus of high expectations, has been defeated, and Taichi, who only just reached Class A, advances to the finals. And now it`s time at last for the final round between Chihaya and Taichi, teammates who have been practicing together since they were in elementary school. The odds are in Chihaya`s favor, but Taichi isn`t playing his usual karuta since he declared that he would defeat her in an official match.\nSource: crunchyroll",
