  "description" : "A group of orc terrorists has taken over an anime shop and is holding the patrons and staff hostage. The police are prevented by law from harming non-humans, so a special squad of elite monsters known as MON is dispatched to deal with them. The four of them, Zombina, Doppel, Manako, and Tionishia, use a combination of deception and brute force to subdue the monster terrorists.\nMON are later dispatched to Kasegi`s house as he managed to make an emergency call before Rachnera wrapped him completely. She manages to escape, and abducts Kimihito at the door to his house. She brings him to a warehouse where she torments him, certain that he will affirm her misanthropic outlook as she had been mistreated by many humans before, but this does not faze him, and he even finds her spider form sexually alluring. A security guard at the warehouse sees them and MON is dispatched there, but Rachnera surrenders peacefully, and Smith assigns Kimihito to be her new host, as it seems he might be able to get along with her properly.",
