  "description" : "It is Kotoko`s birthday and Irie takes her out for the night. Irie and Kotoko are very `lovey dovey` in this episode. Irie and Kotoko pull an all-nighter at the hospital as a lot of emergencies came in, Kotoko stayed even though she seemed to have a fever. When Kotoko returns home in the morning, Oba-chan looks worried over her appearance and asks her if she`s alright. Kotoko thinks she`s running a slight fever, but Irie asks everyone to wait a moment. He asks Kotoko if she`s pregnant, Oba-chan and Yuki both get a shock and yell `what!`. The episode is left at a cliffhanger.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
