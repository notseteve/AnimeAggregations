  "description" : "Everyone, including Eita, is flabbergasted when Himeka introduces herself as Eita`s ex-girlfriend. After a chat with Kaoru he wonders exactly what she sees in him. Himeka is later invited by Masuzu to the club, and after Chiwa and Masuzu are chased off by the hall monitors for performing unsanctioned activities he gets to talk to her alone. She explains how she had found her current world grey and boring and found the way he fought against those bullies the other day so cool.\nAs punishment for their unsanctioned activities, that weekend the club is made to clean the pool. Masuzu`s sister Mana comes by to visit, who informs her that her father is angry and has ordered her to go back to Sweden. Masuzu agrees to leave, which upsets everyone, even Chiwa. Mana then takes a poem Himeka wrote and mockingly recites it, which angers Eita enough that he tries to attack her, but he is beaten up by her bodyguard. This convinces Masuzu to change her mind and remain in Japan despite her father`s orders, and she forces Mana to apologise. Later, Himeka is made an official member of the club.",
