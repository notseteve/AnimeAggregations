  "description" : "We went to the new water park in Tomoeda! It was so wonderful to have a chance to fim Sakura in her swimsuit, even in the winter! Sakura made Kero stay behind because we were with our friends and there were s many people nearby. After Sakura finished giving Rika a swimming lesson, we got some cream soda, and Kero showed up! I knew Sakura couldn`t keep Kero away from such tasty treats. All of a sudden, the wave pool started going crazy and Rika got trapped in it! Sakura couldn`t use her magic because there were so many people, but I noticed there was a waterslide that she could hide in. On her way down it, she and used Watery to stop the waves and save Rika.\nSource: crunchyroll",
