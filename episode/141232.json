  "description" : "As the heroine is sent by her grandfather to look for his assistant, she encounters someone who looks exactly like her. Things only get stranger as she has déjà vu after déjà vu, encounters various versions of herself, and finds her memory less and less clear. She soon learns it to be the work of the fairies, who are manipulating time in order to get several copies of the heroine to make sweets for them. After several loops resulting in hundreds of clones making sweets, the heroine soon encounters a village full of dogs where the assistant lies.",
