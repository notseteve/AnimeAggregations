The association has had it with Gengai’s noisy building of useless junk. Recruited by Otose, the Odd Jobs Trio fights sound with sound by blasting music from their karaoke machine but are stopped by the sudden appearance of the robot Saburo. The Odd Jobs Trio then proceed to relocate Gengai’s workshop to the nearby riverbank, only to end up breaking Saburo and the other robots created by Gengai, who were to perform for the shogun at the upcoming festival. Meanwhile a dangerous man has set foot into Edo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
