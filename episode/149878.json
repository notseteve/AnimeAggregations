  "description" : "Amy tries to help Ledo find a job and introduces him to a number of different industries aboard Gargantia, but he`s just not able to land one. Then the wind dies down and the waves cease, making it a \"Calm Day\", during which time the fleet shuts down so a lot of repair work can be done. But for non-repair-related personnel, it`s time to take a breather. Pinion invites Ledo, Amy and her friends to a BBQ party. Everything seems to be going smoothly... until it doesn`t, with Amy involved in an aerial race and Ledo on the run from overzealous hostesses!\nSource: crunchyroll",
