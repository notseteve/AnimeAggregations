  "description" : "An assassin known as the Turtle is a self-proclaimed coward. He never lets his guard down, and is never overconfident. He makes various plans, and when he`s confident he`s safe, he gets his target… The Turtle gets a job. His target is Bakufu police chief, Katakuriko Matsudaira. The Turtle has been watching him for 6 months. The day when he sets his plan into action finally comes. The Turtle places his finger on the trigger of his favorite gun which he has carefully taken care of, and waits for his target. The person who appears is not Matsudaira, but Gintoki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
