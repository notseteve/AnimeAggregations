  "description" : "Moses becomes the leader of Israel by listening to God`s voice. But then Pharaoh`s army comes to attack. Moses leads his people out of Egypt, following God`s order. They face Pharaoh`s army behind them, and the Red Sea in front. They can go neither forward nor backward. When Moses prays to God for a miracle, The Red Sea parts in the middle, and a road is formed in the sea.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
