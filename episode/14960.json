  "description" : "Sister Kate and Father Remington show Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria photographs tracking leads to Aion involved abduction and murder. However, this investigation will have to wait until after Christmas. The three go to the streets to perform charity work for the convent. After they run into Satella, revealed to be a wealthy art company owner, it is realized that Azmaria has never had an actual Christmas due to her neglected childhood. Azmaria goes to a corner shop where the shopkeeper shows her a snow globe, catching her attention. However, she gives it away to a young man, who wanted to give the snow globe to his girlfriend as a present. Rosette and Chrono find her, and the three go to an orphanage to give alms donated by the convent. Azmaria sees that Rosette and Chrono are satisfied with their new angel badges as her gifts to them. Azmaria later experiences her first real Christmas at the convent, and Rosette and Chrono exchange gifts outside in the snow. \nSource: Wikipedia",
