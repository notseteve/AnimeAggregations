  "description" : "Dororo and Hyakkimaru run into a warrior called Tawara Gorobei, who has enough superhuman strength to easily lift an unruly bull over his head, and the three travel together. Gorobei boasts that he does not believe in monsters and demons, but as long as he is with Hyakkimaru, demons are drawn to them. Soon after they enter a deserted village, a ghostly air engulfs them. Then weird things begin to happen. Blood drips from the ceiling, furniture moves on its own, houses suddenly collapse, and cats and crows are manipulated by demons. Gorobei is scared not of these weird incidents but of Hyakkimaru, who challenges monsters as a matter of course.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
