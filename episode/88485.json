  "description" : "The Guardians offer to help Amu find her eggs. They run into Utau and Saeki Nobuko, the spiritualist, along the way. Saeki can see the Guardian Characters and is at first frightened by them. However, she agrees to help the Guardians in their search. Utau also comes along because she does not like Nikaidou methods. Saeki drives like a maniac and eventually finds Nikaidou. As the Guardians confront Nikaidou, Utau`s manager, Yukari Sanjo, appears and scolds her, asking if Utau is fine with whatever happens to Ikuto. Utau Character Transforms with Il, becoming Lunatic Charm, and attacks the Guardians. Ikuto comes to help and Utau de-transforms upon seeing him. After a struggle, Ran and Miki are freed, but Su is still with Nikaidou. Nikaidou makes a deal with Amu: he will give her a chance to get Su back, but she has to come get Su from his laboratory.\nSource: crunchyroll",
