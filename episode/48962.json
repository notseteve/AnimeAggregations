  "description" : "The arrival of the Amanto has forced the samurai to throw away their swords. But Shinpachi’s father lived by the way of the sword, never losing his samurai honor. With his dying breath, the father entrusts his two children with the samurai spirit. To protect the dojo left behind by his father, Shinpachi works hard at jobs he’s not used to doing. But to a boy who knows only swordsmanship, the world is not a kind place. When Shinpachi is ridiculed by his manager and laughed at by the Amanto, one man stands up to confront them. Shinpachi sees an honest samurai within the man as he pounds down the manager and wipes out the Amanto for ruining his chocolate parfait. Yes, this man is in fact Gintoki Sakata, also known as “Odd Jobs Gin.” The Last Samurai with naturally wavy hair for a trademark?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
