  "description" : "The five boys decide to go to a shrine together. While there, Chizuru accidentally throws the bicycle key he picked up into the box of offerings. The owner of the key \"Akihiro\" forces the boys to carry his unrideable bicycle. With entrance exams looming over the third year high schooler, Akihiro finds the laid back attitude of the boys irritating. Akihiro receives a charm from his girlfriend, but because she has already been accepted into a university, he finds himself unable to reciprocate her kindness.\nSource: crunchyroll",
