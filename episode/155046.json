  "description" : "Hearing about how many students have been starting their own clubs to become eligible to get better uniforms, and thus better living rights, Ryuko decides to start her own Fight Club, assigning Mako as the club president to handle all the paperwork and meetings. As Ryuko increases the club`s reputation by defeating other club presidents, Mako manages to earn a One-Star Goku Uniform, upgrading the Mankanshoku family to a better apartment. Mako`s determination to preserve her family`s newfound happiness moves the family up to an even more luxurious lifestyle. However, Ryuko starts to feel lonely as Mako becomes more serious about her presidential duties and the other family members indulge in their wealth. Just as Ryuko decides to resign from the Fight Club, Satsuki gives Mako a Two-Star Goku Uniform, telling her to defeat Ryuko if she wants to keep her life of luxury. Ryuko takes the brunt of Mako`s attacks, which leads to Mako eventually realizing the error of her ways, disbanding the Fight Club and returning to her life in the slums. Meanwhile, Satsuki reveals that by using Ryuko to purge the weaker clubs, she will restructure the student council by holding a snap election.",
