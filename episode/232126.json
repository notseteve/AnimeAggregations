  "description" : "Chisato`s timely hit in the top of the 5th inning finally allows Fuurin to break free from their no-hit spell and get two runs in against Oobi`s second pitcher Idemitsu. However, Oobi then puts Mayumura in as a reliever and she ends the offense after Tao hits a grounder to shortstop. While Chisato had shown surprisingly nice pitching after starting in the 4th inning, she`s out of energy and has no grip strength left for another inning. Due to inning restrictions, Mutsuko can`t get up on the mound, but then who will pitch?\nSource: crunchyroll",
