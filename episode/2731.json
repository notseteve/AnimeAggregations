  "description" : "After hearing stories about En-o, Enki and Kei’s last queen, Yoko wonders why Keiki chose her as a new queen.  She goes back to town to reflect on her experience during the trip and human stupidity.  At school, Heki tells Sugimoto his stories to help her come to senses.  Sugimoto finds Yoko and accuses her of the low and sinful things she did, but this time, Yoko puts up a fight instead of running away.  When Ko-o shows up, Yoko’s Sui-gu-to (sword) reveals his evil scheme.\nSource: crunchyroll",
