Higuma thanks Hiyori who defeated the \"King.\" Moreover, he brandishes what he \"obtained\" to Hiyori and her friends. It`s Naomitsu and Kikka, but… Did he steal Kikka`s magical power again?! Higuma tells a fuming Teruto the reason he steals magical power, why he was holding a Rebuild Battle, why he had to place a human sacrifice as king, and what Higuma`s objective is. Neo Kyoto`s reconstruction progresses, and the final battle begins!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
