  "description" : "After Suzuka gets home, she ponders her conflicted feelings and stares at her photo of Kazuki. The next day, Miki, seeing how hard Yamato is trying, tries to convince Suzuka to face Yamato, telling her of his feelings. The next day, Honoka persuades Suzuka to walk home with her. She convinces Suzuka to talk to Yamato, telling her to not keep him waiting. When Yamato learns from Miho that Suzuka is going back home to visit a grave, he rushes upstairs to tell Suzuka to stop visiting Kazuki’s grave. To his surprise, she asks him to come along. There, Suzuka confesses her feelings of Yamato in front of Kazuki`s grave. Their new relationship shows when they walk to school together, but like what Saotome stated, the hard part, begins now.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
