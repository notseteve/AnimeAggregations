Bico asks Muhyo to come to Magic Prison No. 18, a prison where very powerful spirits are sealed. A talisman that had been used to seal the bottom level, where the most dangerous spirits are kept, has been ripped off its door... and Bico feels responsible as the one who had made the talisman. Muhyo agrees on the condition that Bico will owe him one later, and they set off for the island that houses the magic prison.\nSource: crunchyroll",
