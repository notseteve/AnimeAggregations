  "description" : "Hagu views Yamada`s snow globe collection, given to her as souvenirs. Tamazaki discusses Nomiya`s feelings for Yamada. At the Harada Design Office, Rika receives a fax that she will participate in a design competition in Spain for an art museum, which then agitates Mayama. Rika explains that Mayama will also participate as well. However, it would take a long time to sort out the paperwork needed to participate, so they are not able to go. Later, Mayama explains to Yamada that Rika checks the weather forecast on her home town, Sapporo, since she hasn`t been there in a long time. Nomiya calls Yamada to ask how she is. After a nine-hour long drive, Nomiya returns at the Fujiwara Design Office and Miwako tells him that Yamada went to Tottori to see him. The next day, Yamazaki takes Yamada around town. Nomiya arrives, only to fall asleep in front of her. Nomiya takes Yamada to see sand dunes in the morning. Nomiya expresses his love for Yamada. \nSource: Wikipedia",
