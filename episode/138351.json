  "description" : "Michelle, a girl claiming to be Lucy`s relative, visits Fairy Tail and gives Lucy a briefcase containing a large metallic rod, which she says is a memento from Lucy`s late father. Because Michelle is an orphan and has nowhere else to go, Lucy takes Michelle in and suggests she start working at Fairy Tail. While adjusting to life at the guild, Michelle suggests that Lucy send a request to investigate the key. After Michelle accidentally drops the rod, it levitates into the air and a set of glowing symbols appears upon it. Makarov becomes suspicious and warns Lucy not to involve herself with the rod any further, though Lucy remains determined to find out what her father asked of her.",
