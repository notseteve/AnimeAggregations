  "description" : "A cameraman visits Takako-so for a week to cover the girls for a documentary TV program. Told to just act naturally for the camera, the girls stick to their normal daily routine until an unusual opportunity appears and Yayoi suggests that they write and perform a live skit show. Still followed by the camera, the girls put their energy into rehearsing right up to the day of the show, but then the wrong costumes are delivered by mistake. Not wanting to disappoint their full audience, the girls do what they can to make their show a success.\nSource: crunchyroll",
