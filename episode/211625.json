  "description" : "Dororo chats with the girl Osushi while Hyakkimaru stands outside experiencing the rain. Suddenly, Hyakkimaru detects a demon sword and rushes off. He encounters a man wielding the sword, and only manages to defeat him by trapping the sword in his prosthetic leg. Dororo goes to retrieve the leg, but when Dororo touches the sword it pulls Dororo back to its owner, the brother of Osushi. Osushi brings her brother Tanosuke home, but he is only interested in the sword. Tanosuke recalls how he was given the demon sword Nihiru (似蛭), and how it changed his life in its eternal search for blood. Meanwhile, Hyakkimaru disarms Dororo, but Tanosuke seizes the sword again, and attacks Hyakkimaru. This time Hyakkimaru kills Tanosuke and Hyakkimaru`s ears are returned to him.\nSource: Revolvy",
