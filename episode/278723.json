  "description" : "News outlets were enthusiastically reporting the great success of the stellar furnace experiment carried out by the students at First High School. However, since Takuma Shippou had heard from his father that the Saegusa Family was going to be the ones to deal with Diet member Kanda, he thinks they used Tatsuya to claim credit for the experiment`s success themselves. Takuma then takes his pent-up anger out on Kasumi Saegusa, who he happened to pass by on campus. Kasumi, unable to turn a blind eye to these insults against her family, is on the brink of engaging in a magic fight with Takuma... But then, the Disciplinary Committee intervenes before either of them makes their move, and takes them in for questioning. Tatsuya suggests they let them duke it out in an official match to end this mutual enmity between the two once and for all.\nSource: crunchyroll",
