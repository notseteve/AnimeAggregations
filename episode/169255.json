  "description" : "Nicolas Brown and Worick Archangelo are the \"Handymen\", a pair of tough mercenaries who will take on jobs that no one else can handle. A new gang has been muscling on the turf of a major Mafia family, and a crooked cop named Chad Adkins has acted as their intermediary. He gives the Handymen the task of eliminating the upstart gang. This they proceed to do with ruthless efficiency, but they spare the life of a young woman mixed up with the gang, a prostitute named Alex Benedetto, whom they get to work for them.",
