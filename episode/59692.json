  "description" : "Tama and his friends come across a huge group of frogs.  They follow the frogs to arrive at a construction site.  It`s where the frogs` friend, Ribiribi is... The power shovel revs its engine just as Ribiribi pokes his head out from the ground!  Watch out, Ribiribi!!  \nSleeping wrapped in the towel blanket that Takeshi gave him, Tama is reminded of his mother`s warmth.  But the precious towel blanket is blown away in the wind, to fall in none other than Bull`s path!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
