  "description" : "Julis goes to an abandoned building to meet up with the perpetrator of the attacks on the students, who turns out to be Silas Norman, one of Lester`s flunkies. He gave himself away when he tried to stop Lester the day before by letting slip that he knew of the aborted duel between Julis and Saya, which was not publicly reported. Lester arrives, and confronts Silas, who attacks, sending his puppets to do his fighting for him. He has a large number of powerful puppets and Lester is badly beaten, and Julis is injured as she realises that only Allekant has the technological ability to make such puppets.\nAyato arrives just in time and by using Ser Veresta he manages to destroy the puppets permanently, and realises that Silas`s strategy involves using his puppets like chess pieces. In that way he manages to destroy all the puppets and defeat Silas. Just as he has finished chains materialise and lock about him and he realises that his sister had done something that sealed away part of his power so he can only use it at its fullest for at most five minutes.\nLater, Silas has come to after his defeat and is confronted by Claudia, who injures him badly so he can be interrogated. She plans to use the incident to blackmail Allekant into making a deal with Seidoukan.",
