  "description" : "Chase discovers that his father had created a Monsuno called Quickforce, who is being held captive and experimented on by S.T.O.R.M. and is unpredictable. (Quickforce may reject someone`s control and possibly kill him/her.) Chase leads a brave infiltration of the S.T.O.R.M. facility in order to save Quickforce. Chase leads the guards away and fights Ace while Bren and Jinja find Quickforce. After playing rock, paper, scissors to see who gets to be Quickforce`s master, Bren rescues Quickforce and is now his \"master\" like Chase is with his Monsuno, Lock. Together, they take care of Trey`s Monsuno.",
