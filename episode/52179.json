  "description" : "Kyou happens to find a paper saying Asu`s school will soon have an Open Day which Asu didn`t tell her older sister. Kyou remembers how lonely she felt back then when it was her turn at school and none of her parents came; to prevent Asu from having the same sad experience Kyou tries to find appropriate clothes so that she can go there.\nThe next morning Kyou happens to find a wallet with lots of money, right in front of their house! Would that be the end of the girls` desperate times, and even allow them to buy adult clothes for Kyou so that she could act as Asu`s mother at her sister`s school?",
