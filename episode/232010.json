  "description" : "Skadi had fainted during the ceremony and is quickly taken to the Central Hospital that is run by Glenn’s mentor, Dr. Cthulhy. Dr. Cthulhy tells Glenn what Skadi’s illness is and the fact that Skadi has no intention of being treated. Dr. Cthulhy is trying to respect her patient’s wishes, which is why she hasn’t tried to treat her. Glenn refuses to accept that and with the help of Kunai, examines Skadi himself. Cthulhy changes her mind after she sees Glenn’s dedication and they both try to figure out a plan to save Skadi.\nSource: crunchyroll",
