  "description" : "It`s the last battle of the class-change race, and Nozomi is up. Ujibe`s training swimsuit has helped craft her body and she`s rearing and ready to go. She`s up against Fujisaki Kotone from the Elite Class. Fujisaki`s mother and sister both have experience as top-class Keijo athletes, which makes her a thoroughbred. Fujisaki dons headphones, barely paying attention to anything going on around her, but has a secret technique in her wings. You`ll have to watch to see who wins this battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
