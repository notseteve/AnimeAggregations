  "description" : "Class rep Manaka frequently daydreams about her classmate Takaaki but at the same time is too shy to talk to boys in general. As Takaaki-kun helps her out in the school library they resolve to have training sessions there, calling each other by their first name when no one else can hear them. But when Manaka one day addresses Takaaki-kun outside the library and his buddy Yuji (who overheard their conversation) tells everyone in their class how awfully close these two have become, this has a surprising effect on all the other girls around Takaaki.",
