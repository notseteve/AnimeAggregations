Yamada later notices that Miwako was trying to cheer her up, causing her to cry. Nomiya becomes worried that she is staying at Miwako`s house. The next day Takemoto is infuriated that Morita ate his bread. However, Hagu offers to share some of her bread with him. Takemoto declines, and Morita eats her bread instead. Soon after, Morita receives a call from Kaoru. Kaoru asks Morita to do one more job, which he hesitantly accepts. Takemoto wants to get driver`s license as soon as possible in order to work full-time with the carpenters he had met from his journey. Takemoto asks Mayama why he still lives at the apartment, and Mayama says he is saving money for Rika. Yamada waits in the Fujiwara Design Office for Miwako, but Nomiya unexpectedly visits. Yamada starts to develop feelings for Nomiya. \nSource: Wikipedia",
