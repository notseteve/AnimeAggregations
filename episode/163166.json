  "description" : "Dreamcast, Saturn, and Mega Drive have come inside the world of Space Channel 5 to get the credits they need to graduate.  They challenge aliens to dance battles with Ulala to save Center-sensei`s friends.  But not only do they have to save them, they have to earn view ratings too.  Saturn strips down to her bathing suit to help earn ratings, but things take an unexpected twist thanks to Center-sensei`s friends.\nSource: crunchyroll",
