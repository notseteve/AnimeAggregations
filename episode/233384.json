Each group is allowed to choose its own fairy tale, exciting Yayoi Haru`s producer spirit, and he offers to come up with Gravi`s fairy tale. However, the major fairy tales are quickly selected by the other groups, and he struggles to come up with an idea.\nWhile watching Yayoi agonize over the decision, Hajime Mutsuki invites him to a store that specializes in picture books.\nSource: crunchyroll",
