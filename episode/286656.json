  "description" : "Kenshin steps into Shingetsu Village, a place where the Mishima brothers escaped from. The village is currently under the control of Senkaku, Shishio’s subordinate, who rules with an iron fist and uses violence to control the villagers. They are frightened of the violence and unable to do anything but obey. The village has decayed and exudes an unusual aura about it. Kenshin heads over to where Shishio is located with Hajime, who’s learned about the current situation and visited the village. In the background of these events, Eiji’s heart burns with the desire for revenge against Senkaku.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
