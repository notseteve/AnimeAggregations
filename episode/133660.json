  "description" : "Inga has disappeared, but Shinjurou continues to search for the truth alone. While investigating the TV station bombing, Shinjurou, who suspects that Kaishou used Bettenou to do it, devises a plan to uncover the truth. Kaishou is requested to testify at a budget committee, but if done via video monitor while he`s in his hospital bed, Bettenou`s ability to manipulate people through a person`s words should be blocked. Kaishou, who easily deflects the rigorous interrogation, says, \"There are an innumerable amount of truths. Being satisfied with just one truth is no more than ceasing to think about it beyond that point.\" Angered at the words, Shinjurou questions Kaishou without thinking and asks Rie to testify as his trump card. Rie explains, \"Right after the explosion at the TV station, I saw my father at home.\" Was the Kaishou at the TV station an illusion produced by Bettenou? Then Inga appears in womanly form to ask the truth of an unexpected person!",
