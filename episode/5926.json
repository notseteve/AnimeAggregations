  "description" : "Urd and Skuld argue about who is better at baseball. They duplicate themselves to make teams. Gan-chan and Belldandy commentate to a crowd of fake fans while the two battle. The game goes into extra innings, and Urd and Skuld begin to play in ridiculous fashions, like imitating the tornado pitch of the Tasmanian Devil. Urd then disappears for her \"ultimate pitch,\" and the rest all imitate her, leaving the stadium deserted.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
