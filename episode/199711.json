  "description" : "The first match of the summer tournament is finally here! For Daigo and the other 6th graders, it`s the last tournament for them with the Mifune Dolphins. The Dolphins, who`ve been being beaten out in the first match the past years, are about to face the Tanikawa Eagles. Coach Tashiro, acknowledging his growth, puts in Daigo on the right field and 2nd batter. However, the star player Urabe and Nagai, now bumped down to 8th batter for Daigo, are not thrilled that someone riding on his father`s coattails is on the starting line up, and glare at Daigo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
