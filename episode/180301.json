  "description" : "Tokio and Calen go to Onigashima to find the next True History. And then a peach came rolling down the river... wait, that`s a red ogre`s butt?! The red ogre tells them that he was punished by someone more ogre-like than actual ogres and starts crying. He leads them to a stage, where loud music is playing, and the one on stage who has all the female ogres` attention is a super hot Momotaro?! Calen tries to go talk some sense into him, but falls for him, too! Wait, Bimajo, too?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
