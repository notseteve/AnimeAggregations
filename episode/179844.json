  "description" : "An article of the Charter of the Universal Century entitled \"Future\" records the fact that humanity set out into space with the expectation of new possibilities. As a central figure in the Federation government, Riddhe`s father Ronan is terrified of Laplace`s Box, in which this article is recorded. Now he has approved the firing of the colony laser in order to destroy Magallanica, where the Box is located. Banagher`s and Riddhe`s Gundams successfully use a psycho-field to defend Magallanica, at the cost of Banagher being absorbed by the Unicorn Gundam. Mineva reveals the truth about the Box to people all over the world, while Otto and Zinnerman help her escape the pursuing Federation fleet. And meanwhile, urged on by the thoughts of his father Cardeas, Banagher returns to Mineva`s side.\nSource: crunchyroll",
