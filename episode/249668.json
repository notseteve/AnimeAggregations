  "description" : "It`s nIghttime at the Metropolitan Police Academy. As the cherry blossoms fall, the sounds of Furuya Rei and Matsuda Jinpei duking it out echo across the premises. Even though they`re attending a police academy, Matsuda dislikes Furuya`s determination to become a police officer no matter what. Neither one gives any ground as their fight continues. Around 2AM, Morofushi Hiromitsu wakes from a nightmare and hears a knock on his door. Standing outside his room is Furuya, who is covered in injuries. Upon seeing him, Morofushi asks Furuya if he thinks he`ll get along with the guy who did that to him. During their morning assembly, standing next to the injured Furuya and Matsuda are their classmates Morofushi Hiromitsu, Hagiwara Kenji, and Date Wataru. Rookie class instructor Onizuka Hachizo asks how they got their injuries, but Date thinks quickly and tells him a lie. Furuya finds it odd when Matsuda demonstrates a thorough understanding of a police officer`s responsibilities despite his hatred of the police and begins investigating his past.\nSource: crunchyroll",
