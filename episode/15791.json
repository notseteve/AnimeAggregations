  "description" : "After the degenaration of MegaGargomon the tamers came to know that Zhuqiaomon is still alive and still wants to fight. Zhuqiaomon attacks the tamers. Taomon protects them until Zhuqiaomon is stopped by another Sovereign, Azulongmon. Zhuqiaomon battles him and Guilmon and Terriermon join in to no effect and are nearly destroyed. Takato jumps out of Taomon`s shield to help and Guilmon and Takato Digivolve to Gallantmon to fight. Azulongmon lets the battle go on a bit to make a point of how strong Bio-Merged warriors are but ultimately stops the battle and manages to convince Zhuqiaomon the this fight is useless and they should all fight against the real enemy D-Reaper.\nSource: crunchyroll",
