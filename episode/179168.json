  "description" : "An invisible Willwear is causing massive damage in random attacks across Tokyo.  Unit 8 tracks the Willwear down to the quagmire zone, a hotbed of illegal immigrant activity.  The area is a lawless zone, so Sena is sent to infiltrate as a civilian garbage collector.  There, he meets an illegal immigrant from a equatorial nation, who he suspects of being involved in the attacks.  When he strikes up a friendship with the man, however, he`s forced to choose between his personal feelings of respect, and his duty.\nSource: crunchyroll",
