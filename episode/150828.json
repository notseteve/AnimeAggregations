  "description" : "Shiori fixes a tape recorder for Yukiji then talks about her days as a student at Hakuō Academy. 7 years ago, when Maria was the student council president, Shiori is amazed how academic and cute Maria is, so she shows her a video of her growth…but Maria breaks it like it was an accident. In the end, it seems Maria refuses to expose any of her cute traits. At the Sanzenin Mansion, Maria discovers a love letter for Hayate; however, he wants to turn it down then Nagi returns a strict reply to the sender; a second later, the sender replies a horror letter to Hayate which now scares him. Nagi devises Hayate and Maria to go on a fake date in order to drive away the sender. The sender is revealed to be Linn and he gets enrage of seeing Hayate dating Maria. Hayate and Maria follow Nagi`s script by trying on different clothes even though it`s embarrassing, with Ayumu and Hinagiku following them thinking their date is real. Last, Hayate and Maria go to an aquarium, as Linn tries to get involved with the maid, but fails. Then they run into Ayumu and Hinagiku and they ask if they`re really dating, and respond it`s just their imagination. At sundown, Maria hopes she`ll find a boyfriend like Hayate someday.\nSource: Wiki",
