  "description" : "The students of the Cross Academy leave for the holiday, and Rima, Ruka, Kaname, Akatsuki, and Takuma go to the Aido family residence; however, Hanabusa stays on campus. Shiki goes to his home rather than the Aido residence, as he was summoned by his uncle. In the Night Class dorm, Hanabusa recalls asking Akatsuki to investigate Kaname`s family while at the Aido residence. Hanabusa goes to the Day Class dorm, and meets Yuuki and Zero, who makes dinner for him. Afterwards, Hanabusa takes a bath and recalls meeting Kaname when he was younger, noting the change in his personality before and after Kaname`s parents died. While making dinner, Yuuki cuts herself and tells Zero to drink the blood, a scene witnessed by Hanabusa. He returns to the Night Class dorm and enters Kaname`s study, where he realizes Kaname is planning something.\nSource: IMDB.com",
