  "description" : "Conan, Kogoro, and Ran In Purple Toyota Crown GRS204 Drive pass through Mount Fuyana on their way home and are stopped by Misao Yamamura who instilled a road block in order to catch the Silver Witch, a woman who drives a White FD car and challenges people in a drag race. When the witch drifts, the tire makes a sound that sound like a woman screaming. Yamamura reveals his grandma raced against the witch but gave up when the witch drove into the air. Kogoro decides to investigate on the identity of the witch and returns to Mount Fuyana the next day, taking Conan and Ran with him in Orange Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X (CZ4A). Upon meeting the witch, Kogoro has a drag race with her but stops when Conan reveals that the witch drove into a road less area. Kogoro tells Yamamura to stop all White FD drivers and wait for his arrival. Once there, Kogoro interrogates the three suspect pairs in order to find out which one of them is the witch.",
