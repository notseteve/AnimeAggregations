  "description" : "Still on the beach holidays the whole group helps Taeko`s grandmother running the beach house. Taeko wonders what Kaoru means to her after he was so kind to her. Chika gets aware of that and decides she has to `help` her older cousin - by luring both Kaoru and (short-sighted) Taeko into the onsen`s shower at the same time.\nAfter this day`s work is over, grandma asks Kaoru to go out with Taeko. Taeko realizes that she is practically on a date with Kaoru and gets super-nervous.",
