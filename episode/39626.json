  "description" : "The Star Force argues for the prisoners` release, but Prime Minister Bemlaze, visiting Berth for some obscure reason, refuses, saying that they are a threat to his authority. Likewise, on Galmania, Emperor Desslok shoots one of his generals whom he has learned is a Guardiana sympathiser. Like Bemlaze, Desslok proclaims himself to be the only God. Back on Berth, Bemlaze has grown tired of the Star Force`s accussations of human rights violations, and orders them all arrested. The Star Force retreats after first breaking the barriers of the prison. But, Bemlaze destroys the entire planet with planetary missiles.\n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
