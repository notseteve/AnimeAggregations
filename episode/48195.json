  "description" : "There`s going to be a meteor shower, and Akari, Aika and Alice have made plans to watch it together.  But this time, there`s a little twist - Al, one of Neo-Venezia`s gravity-controlling Gnomes, will be there as well.  Even though he`s shorter than the girls, he`s actually three years their senior; and he knows all about physics, planets, and the beauty of the universe.  What he doesn`t seem to know, however, is how Aika feels whenever she`s with him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
