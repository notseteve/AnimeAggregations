Luckily, Jingle and his faithful wanderer companion, Herbert the pig, happen to be in town. Herbert, by chance, finds little Penelope and rescues her from the perilous hole. From that moment on, Penelope is absolutely taken with Herbert. But Herbert and Jingle are in the midst of their travels, and the time to say goodbye comes all too soon. Penelope, crushed to see her new friend go, runs away and has her mind set to follow Herbert wherever he goes. How can the other Ham-Hams persuade Penelope to come back home?\nSource: Wikipedia",
