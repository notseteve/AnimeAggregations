  "description" : "Rika and the others encounter an Andromon who`s fighting a snake Digimon called Orochimon who`s been terrorizing a bunch of Gekomon to make it milkshakes. The Tamers decide to help Andromon defeat Orochimon, but after a hard battle, Andromon de-digivolves into Guardromon. Orochimon is finally defeated when Jeri uses a LadyDevimon card on Leomon. When all is said and done, Kazu receives a Digivice and Guardromon becomes Kazu`s partner. Meanwhile, Takato and Henry are still falling through the data stream leaving Guilmon to worry about Takato with Rika and the others.\nSource: crunchyroll",
