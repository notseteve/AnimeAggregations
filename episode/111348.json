  "description" : "Haruka receives an acceptance letter for an idol audition. It seems to have been a mistake made by Yayoi’s celebrity production, but Yayoi begs Haruka to just pretend to participate in the finals on February 14th. Haruka gives in, but to her surprise, a full-blown lesson awaited her. On the other hand, Yuuto is picked up by Himemiya Milan, a popular idol from Yayoi’s office, and ends up becoming an instant-manager. On top of that, Milan turns out to have a rather outrageous personality.\nSource: crunchyroll",
