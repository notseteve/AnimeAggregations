  "description" : "As Monkey D. Luffy and his crew are running low on food supplies, they discover an island known as the Gourmet Island. As Luffy, Nami, Sanji and Tony Tony Chopper explore the island and discover everything to be made of food, they encounter Toriko travelling with Komatsu, who initially mistake Chopper as potential food. After encountering some Roasted Boars and clearing up their misunderstandings, the two groups search for a large bird which Toriko and Luffy manage to beat. They spend the night sampling their spoils. However, Nami and Komatsu are kidnapped by a group of Cocoalas. As the gang head towards a mountain where a delicious fruit is said to exist and where the Cocoalas have taken Nami and Komatsu, the gang end up against a fierce group of lions, but are aided by Toriko`s allies: Sunny, Coco & Rin. They later find Nami and Komatsu being held captive by a giant Cocoala and work together to defeat it. Afterwards, an eruption occurs, revealing the entire island to be one giant dessert. After Luffy and crew gather the provisions they need, they set off on their journey as Toriko continues his search for his Full Course menu.\nSource: Wikipedia",
