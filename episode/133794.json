  "description" : "Wilhelmina, Rebecca, and Khamsin begin a long and hard fight against Sabrac, which seems to be impossible to win. Shana leaves them and meets Snake of the Festival, who has awakened his true form, and promises him to fight him, make him the person he used to be and to live in a perfect world along with him. She has realized that the two personalities of her were not the Flame Haze and the person, but the one who would and the one who would not fight for the dream of a perfect life. However, both have one thing that assures the chance for this dream to be realized—the most powerful unrestricted spell, love. Shana says she will use the Heaven-and-Earth Sundering spell to kill the God of Creation and the Bal Masque if she has to in order to defeat them.\nSource: Wiki",
