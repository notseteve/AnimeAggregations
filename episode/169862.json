  "description" : "Ui runs off after the incident with Rin, and has gone home to her parents. Hayato, despite originally wishing she would do so is troubled, and having gotten so used to Ui he makes two servings of breakfast before remembering she isn`t there.\nAt the Student Council the next day, Ui is visibly upset, and Ayane tries to console her. Later, the meeting comes to order, the student council has received an email from a girl whose case is very similar to Ui and Hayato. Rin, who was eavesdropping at the door, is invited to join the discussion, and there is a debate, with Karen advocating harsh measures and Hayato and Rin advocating understanding. The girl sent a second message telling the council that she had kissed and made up with her boyfriend.\nAfter everyone else leaves, Ui and Hayato are left alone, and he tries to reconcile with her. She tells him to kiss her as a sign of their making up, and initially he gives her just a light kiss on the forehead, but this rapidly escalates into heavy, torrid kissing. They are interrupted by a little girl who seems to be a relation of Ui`s.",
