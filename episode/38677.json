  "description" : "It is the day of the fitness tests, and while Yamato was a legend in his hometown schools, he is failing miserably in his new school. Later, he realizes that this school specializes in sports. Initially, Yamato was unwilling to run the track test, due to his \"abysmal\" running in middle school. Eventually, he is persuaded to run, and reveals himself to be faster than the boy who got into the school through sprinting scholarship. According to Yasunobu, this supposedly earned him \"points\" with Suzuka.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
