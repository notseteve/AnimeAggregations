  "description" : "While Antonia`s maid army holds off the advancing military, Kio and the others are able to launch. Manami and Aoi confess their feelings to Kio, and Eris states that according to Catians` law, all three can be his lovers. Aoi, Manami, and Eris launch in powered armor and jet platforms to fight the Dogsian armada. While struggling to save the Catian ship, Kio is forced to use Kuune`s captain bell to transform himself to save the ship.\n \nAfter Eris, Manami, and Aoi finish off the Dogsian fleet, the command ship crashes into its own orbital base, causing it to plummet to Japan. Aoi flies by herself to stop it, only for Manami to join her. After a late save from Kio in the rocket they all hug, only to find Kio has become a Catboy.\nAfter solving their situation in space, the Catians finally unveil their Christmas present to mankind; a fully functional space elevator, which coincidentally looks like a Christmas tree. \nSource: Wikipedia",
