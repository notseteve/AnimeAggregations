The Land of Fire comes under suspicion, as it is the only country to have suffered no losses. Mounting suspicion among the four nations is bringing them to the brink of another Great Ninja War. In the Hidden Leaf Village, Tsunade orders her forces to prevent anything from happening that would lead to war, while also trying to discover the truth. At the same time, Naruto and his friends discover some bad news: Kakashi has left the village.\nSource: crunchyroll",
