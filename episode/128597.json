  "description" : "In the summer of 2010, self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou and his childhood friend Shiina Mayuri go to the Akihabara Radio Kaikan building to attend a seminar on time travel by Doctor Nakabachi. While there, Rintaro meets a girl named Makise Kurisu, who claims to have met him fifteen minutes before despite having never met her himself. Later, after receiving a scrambled video message on his phone, Rintaro hears a scream and discovers Kurisu lying in a pool of blood, indicating that she was stabbed to death. Upon sending an e-mail about the situation to his friend, Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida, Rintaro feels a strange sensation, before discovering the streets have become vacant and a strange satellite has crashed into the radio building. Later, as Rintaro`s \"Future Gadget Laboratory\" work on a phone-controlled microwave that turns bananas into gelatinous form, Rintaro is surprised to learn that the seminar he was attending was apparently cancelled, as if it had never taken place. Afterwards, as Rintaro and Daru go to a forum being held, Rintaro discovers the e-mail he sent Daru about Kurisu`s stabbing had arrived three days earlier, before coming across Kurisu, who is alive and well.\nSource: Wikipedia",
