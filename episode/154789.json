  "description" : "Sawamura is nervous being roomed with his older baseball teammates. However, their unexpectedly warm welcome makes him feel right at home. Next day, he feels too much at home, and ends up sleeping in for his first practice! There, he reunites with Miyuki who also overslept. Unfortunately, Miyuki`s advice on resolving the situation only makes it worse. The head coach himself tells Sawamura that using him as a player is out of the question. However, recalling the messages from his teammates back home, he declares to the coach, \"I came here to become the ace of this team!\" So the head coach gives him a challenge.\nSource: crunchyroll",
