  "description" : "During the Taisho era of 1918, 17-year-old Benio Hanamura thrives on bucking tradition. A boisterous and stubborn tomboy, Miss Hanamura is a quintessential Miss Modern. She shirks her \"lady-like\" activities to practice kendo and climb trees. Gasp! She vows to find love on her own terms but her family has other plans. With war raging in the background, Benio finds herself fighting her own battles; sometimes with a kendo sword, sometimes with an umbrella, but always in her way.\nSource: crunchyroll",
