  "description" : "Murakami Ryouta is still obsessed with guilt and love for his dead childhood sweetheart, Kuroneko, and it is driving his life. It leaves him chilly and awkward around women and apathetic towards his own future.\nDuring Homeroom, a new transfer student is introduced, Kuroha Neko (lit: The Black Cat). Kuroha is the spitting image of his lost Kuroneko. Kuroha, however, claims to have never met him before. Kuroha can`t seem to do some of the simplest things (like arithmetic or swimming), but she believes two people from the school are going to die, and is intent on preventing those deaths.\nKuroha attempts to change the fates of the doomed, reveals strange powers, and reveals an even stranger secret.",
