  "description" : "Satella reminisces to when Fiore motivated her in using her jewelsummoning powers. Elder Hamilton gives Chrono a sword with Enochian texts engraved into the blade, allowing Chrono to battle against Aion without having to transform. Fiore breaks out of the convent, taking Joshua with her. Rosette is to use her power of miracles to heal the sick and wounded under the command of Aion. Rosette soon gathers a large crowd of people who refer to her as a savior. Satella spots Fiore with Joshua, and she forges a jewelsummoning barrier. Failing to convince her to be her sister, Satella is forced to spar against Fiore. After Chrono touches Rosette`s bloodstained wrist, Aion exposes Chrono as a devil in front of the crowd. Fiore reveals that she is the shadow of Satella`s sister who died ten years ago by Aion`s heads. Satella embraces Fiore and then stabs both of them using her jewel, causing Fiore to remember Satella before she passes away. Satella is found heavily bruised, as she tells Chrono to find Rosette and asks Azmaria to sing before her life ends. \nSource: Wikipedia",
