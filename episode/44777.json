  "description" : "Furious after hearing the news of the defection of three captains, Sajin Komamura arrives at the Sokyoku ready to beat the treachery out of Aizen and his lackeys. Captain Komamura quickly realizes that deception is even a part of Sosuke Aizen`s fighting technique, and the rogue captain proves to be more of a challenge than he expected. Ichigo, battered after his clash with Byakuya Kuchiki, lies helplessly on the sidelines, watching this battle between captains.\nSource: crunchyroll",
