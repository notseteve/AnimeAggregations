  "description" : "Having somewhat got a grip on the Super Saiyan God form, Gokuu initially manages to keep up with Beerus, but he soon realizes that his opponent is still not fighting at his maximum. It is revealed that Beerus is doing so only to motivate Gokuu to catch up with him. To that end, Beerus drags Gokuu to space where he swiftly knocks him out. Gokuu comes crashing down back to Earth and ends up in an ocean. Amazed by such power, Gokuu gets excited and powers up, healing himself in the process. Willing to have another go, he flies out of the ocean and dashes towards Beerus.\nSource: Wikipedia",
