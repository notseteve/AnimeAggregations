  "description" : "Connor, Cubix, and the Botties (in Dr. K`s battle bots) attempt to save Bubbletown from Dr. K`s enormous robot. Eventually, they wind up having to save each other- as Abby gets sucked back inside and Connor runs to her rescue. Eventually, it comes down to Cubix and the big monster, and Cubix`s only chance to win is by transformation. He changes from mode to mode until he overheats and overwhelms his opponent. Unfortunately, he overheats and overwhelms himself, too, and Connor is the only one that can revive him.\nSource: bcdb.com",
