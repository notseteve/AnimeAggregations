  "description" : "Nadeshiko invites Amu to a sleep over so that the two can get to know each other better. But in order to keep Ami home, Amu makes up a story about the Seven Mysteries of the Fujisaki house. As Amu arrives at Nadeshiko home, she begins to believe her own story. Amu and Nadeshiko enjoy their time together, but after Amu takes her bath, she gets lost inside the house. Meanwhile, the Guardian Characters chase a mouse and the ruckus they make terrifies Amu. At night, Amu attempts to sneak out, but she gets lost again. Amu comes across the dance hall where Nadeshiko is practicing for an upcoming performance and Amu thinks that she has failed as a friend for being selfish. However, the housekeeper informs Amu that this was not true. The next morning, Amu is happy that her first sleepover was with Nadeshiko.\nSource: crunchyroll",
