  "description" : "Walking around her neighborhood, Laura sees that many houses have wind-socks in the form of flying carp that flow gracefully from their rafters. She runs home and asks her mom if she can put one up at their house, too! But her mom won`t let her. That day, however, Grandpa Woody comes over. He tells Laura that when he was younger, he dreamed of riding on the back of a flying fish, soaring through the sky. All excited, Laura embarks with Grandpa Woody on an invention escapade: to create a mechanical flying carp! Unfortunately, their attempts don`t go too smoothly. \nSource: Wikipedia",
