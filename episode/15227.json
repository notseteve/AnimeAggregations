  "description" : "Satella finds Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria in a desert, offering them a ride in her limousine to her villa. Chrono comes down with a fever on the way there. While Chrono rests in the villa, Rosette and Satella drive all over town to find a pharmacy that supplies medicine strong enough to reduce Chrono`s fever. The two go to a fortune teller in hopes to find an alternative way to help Chrono. After picking up over-the-counter medicine, Rosette also comes down with a fever. Azmaria prepares dinner for Rosette and Chrono, who both are pleased with her cooking. Azmaria explains to Satella that Rosette and Chrono worry for each other. Steiner, Satella`s butler, notices a change in her attitude, one of affection toward the others. Later at night, Rosette kisses Chrono as a cure for his illness while he has fallen asleep, as the result is shown to be effective. \nSource: Wikipedia",
