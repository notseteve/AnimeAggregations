  "description" : "The whole town is sizzling in a strong summer heat wave, and the girls are doing the best they can to beat the heat.  But then, Akari spots a woman dressed all in black, with even her face covered with a thick black veil.  Aika tells Akari a Manhome legend about the spirit of a woman dressed in black, who was angered that she couldn`t be buried on San Michele Island.  Supposedly the ghost spirits away any gondolier foolish enough to take her on board... but that`s only an old story, right?\nSource: crunchyroll",
