  "description" : "In \"The Wonder of That Rainy Day...\", Akari and Alicia are visiting a shrine that looks just like the old Japanese shrines on Manhome.  Though the grounds are beautiful, there`s also a hint of mystery and danger in the air...  And in \"The Discoveries On That Spring Day...\", Akari and Alicia are wandering on a different island, looking for a beautiful spot that Alicia once saw.  But the farther they go, the less certain their path becomes.  How do you reach your destination when you don`t know the way there?\nSource: crunchyroll",
