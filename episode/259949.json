  "description" : "Team Z was crushed by Team X, who centered the offensive play around egoistical yet skilled Barou. Responding to Ego`s urge to \"take up a weapon,\" the players discuss what their weapons are in preparation for the next match. However, Isagi struggles to identify what it is. Using \"the smell of the goal\" he felt in the game against Team X as a hint, Isagi and the others go against Team Y in the next match.\nSource: crunchyroll",
