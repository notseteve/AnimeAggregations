  "description" : "Syunso has been seeming off lately and while the cause is unclear, it`s likely because he has been unable to make any progress on his art since they haven`t found the black cat. When Syunso forgets his pencil case one day, Mei heads to his school to bring it to him and is mistaken for his girlfriend by his classmates and a huge uproar ensues. The pair escape the chaos by ducking into an empty classroom where they are found by Syunso`s best friend, Yokoyama Taikan. Taiken notices something strange in Syunso`s eyes and urges him to go to the doctor immediately.\nSource: crunchyroll",
