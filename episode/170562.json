  "description" : "Kagami is in low spirits, having suddenly lost enthusiasm for everything, even his otaku hobbies. While he is drinking his favourite soda pop at the maid café an old friend of his, Toune Yamato, comes by to see him. Inspired by his ground-breaking paper, she went on to make a career as a physicist, and became part of the research laboratory KEC, which is now racing against Tim Berners-Lin`s CERM to make a physical realisation of the \"Anywhere Door\". She plans to recruit him to join the project, and brings him to their secret underground research facility, which was built according to his tastes. He is admired by everyone on the team who are further impressed after he manages to stabilise the facility`s particle accelerator. Hiiragi somehow finds him at the research facility, and tells him that he is fired.",
