  "description" : "The Rose Cross witchcraft club gains significant influence around the Academy by selling love curses to their fellow students. Leader Hiroko Takashiro later releases Nami Kozono from her love spell and she joins the club. However, when the girls attempt to summon a demon, the ritual horribly backfires, causing Takashiro to change her mind about magic. In a crazed lust for power and vengeance, Kozono usurps the club`s leadership and kidnaps student Reika Kitami to complete her ultimate goal: summoning the Devil himself.\nSource: Bible Black Wiki",
