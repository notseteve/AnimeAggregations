  "description" : "Part A “It`s What`s On The Inside That Counts\" While taking Sadaharu out for a walk, Gintoki runs into Katsura who is with some “thing” that hardly resembles Elizabeth. Shinpachi and Kagura also notice the change in Elizabeth, or more like being totally replaced, and decide to bring Katsura back to his senses.   Part B “It`s What`s On The Inside That Counts, But Only To A Certain Extent” It is morning and Gintoki wakes up in his closet for some reason. Dumbfounded, he makes his way to his bedroom after going to the bathroom, only to find himself already sleeping in his bed. Realizing that something funny is happening to him yet again, he tries to resolve it through trial and error.\nSource: crunchyroll",
