  "description" : "Having settled on Kouta`s idea of putting on a musical, the boys go off on a training camp retreat to Seiichirou`s family`s vacation home in order to plan. However, despite a valiant effort and being complete amateurs with no theater experience the boys are at a loss. In such times it is important to refresh oneself and so the boys indulge in the fun of the beach. At night the weather takes a sudden turn and a huge rainstorm blows through knocking out the power. While the other boys are able to sleep Kouta finds himself frighteninly alone in the darkened vacation home.\nSource: crunchyroll",
