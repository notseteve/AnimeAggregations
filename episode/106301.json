  "description" : "April 3rd is Sakuya’s birthday. One of the gals is a bit worried regarding this day of celebration. Her name is Chiharu Harukaze. She is the secretary of Hakuo Academy and the manager of the Maid Café “Himawari”. Izumi and her friends invite her to go to karaoke which she turns down because she said she doesn’t like noisy places. Actually, the real reason is that she works at a maid café where she is always welcoming the customers energetically even though that is not her true personality. She heard that Hayate and Nagi will be at Sakuya’s party which worries her. Will she be able to protect her secret of being a maid?\nSource: crunchyroll",
