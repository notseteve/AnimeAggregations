Their bonds cause Fujiwara to fly into a rage and he activates Attribute Gravity. The effects cause Johan`s monsters` attacks to hit Juudai`s monsters. When it`s time for Juudai to attack, Fujiwara activates Attribute Chameleon which makes Juudai`s monsters attack Johan`s monsters. As Fujiwara causes their monsters to attack each other in denial of their bonds, Honest appears and speaks of Fujiwara`s tragic past.\nSource: crunchyroll",
