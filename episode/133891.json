  "description" : "Yuu still hasn`t forgotten the pain caused by the loss of his Digimon partner, Damemon. When the Digimon Hunter Airu sees one of Yuu`s long-cherished Digimon, Cutemon, her heart is instantly taken! In order to steal Cutemon, she takes Yuu to the Digimon world, DigiQuartz, and traps him. Cutemon tries desperately to save him, but his strength is nowhere near enough... Tagiru and Gumdramon manage to save Yuu and Cutemon once, but of course, Airu has no intention of giving up! She continues to relentlessly pursue Cutemon. Eventually the Digimon Hunters Ryouma and Ren, along with Tagiru, Taiki, Shoutmon, and Dorulumon, also become involved in the heated conflict...!\nSource: crunchyroll",
