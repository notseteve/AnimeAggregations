  "description" : "The numbers 2220 suddenly appear from J’s bracelet. While J is trying to figure out what the numbers mean, he hears news that they’re trying to demolish the mansion. J doesn’t want to lose the one place he has left that holds memories of Tenna, so he goes to the headmaster to discuss the matter. The headmaster tells J that it’s the chairman’s decision and there’s very little he can do about it. The rest of the student council members see J look down, so they try to figure out a way to help him. They end up coming up with a plan to make the mansion look like it’s haunted.\nSource: crunchyroll",
