  "description" : "Hinako`s intense training under the exasperated Yua comes to an end, and the theater society is busy with wardrobe fittings for the culture festival that starts the next day. Mayuki helps with the costume fitting, and Hinako, Yua, Kuina, and all the other members begin to look more and more glamorous. While in their costumes, they end up doing an impromptu dress rehearsal, and Hinako is thrilled when she makes it through without messing up any lines for the first time. Yua reminds her that the actual performance is yet to come, and soon enough, the day of the culture festival arrives.\nSource: crunchyroll",
