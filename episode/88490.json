  "description" : "Ichigo hits Grimmjow with a mighty blow. Grimmjow is about to collapse, but he grabs Zangetsu and pulls himself up. He begins to remember his time as an Adjucha, a Hollow that has an extreme hunger for souls. They continue to obsessively devour souls until they reach the level of Gillians, and then finally they become Adjuchas. But those who become Adjuchas have the fear of degenerating. If they don`t continue to consume Hollows, they will degenerate into Gillians. Grimmjow continues to attack his fellow Hollows until he meets an interesting band of Adjuchas.\nSource: crunchyroll",
