  "description" : "A new anime, Katchu Ranbu, or Kachu Rabu for short, has started, and it`s hugely popular. Bot Kae and Nishina are elated about the show, until they find out that they each ship Lord x Akane and Akane x Lord respectively and get into a huge fight. Their friendship appears to be heading to a halt, so Igarashi, Nanashima, Shinomiya and Mutsumi try to help the pair out. Unfortunately, it looks like their reverse ship war is just heating up.\nSource: crunchyroll",
