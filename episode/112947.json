With her sidekick Chutaro, Reinya plays a slapstick game of cat-and-mouse with the perverted Captain, the delusional Detective, and Nocchi of the Oedo Police Department.\nThe Golden Umakabai, a solid gold statue of a local instant noodle brand, is scheduled to go on display at the Hakata Museum. Following her motto “nothing is greater than gold,” Reinya decides to snatch this golden treasure. However, the Captain, the Detective, and Nocchi are on full alert for Reinya at the museum.\nSource: crunchyroll",
