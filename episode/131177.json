  "description" : "Arriving at Moeka`s apartment only to learn that she committed suicide, Rintaro leaps to an earlier time, finding Moeka to be a nervous wreck due to not having been contacted by a person known as FB, who had given her the orders to find the IBN 5100. Rintaro steals Moeka`s phone and sends a D-Mail from it, but discovers that she had lied about the contents of the message she had sent in the previous World Line. Confronts Moeka about FB and tells her about her future suicide, Rintaro finds the offending text, which involved the location of the IBN 5100, but annulling it via another D-Mail still does not change the World Line. As Okabe realises he needs to send a D-Mail from FB`s phone in order to convince her past self to follow its instructions, Moeka, feeling betrayed by FB for not contacting her, tells him where to find the IBN 5100. \nSource: Wikipedia",
