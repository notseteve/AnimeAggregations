  "description" : "An out-of-this-world tag team is born! And they`re called the Fami-Wrestlers! Ignoring the matches listed on the card, this duo starts attacking one team after another! Kaori Sakiyama grabs a mic in the stunned crowd and gives an all-out performance! Feeling she should stop their fighting, a blood-thirsty pro wrestler named Mio Hayase appears. Sakiyama yells to her over the mic, \"you look like you poisoned the princess in the dragon castle and switched places with her!\" No one can stop Sakiyama from egging on the fight! Or so they thought. Mio hits Sakiyama in the head and she collapses. Sakiyama`s body may be completely worn out, but she rushes in through spirit alone! Due to Sakiyama`s energy and yelling, Maki gets fired up and enters her battle mode! Everyone expects the super-strong pro wrestling duo of Mio Hayase and Sanpagita Kai to win and the bell rings! Mio is shocked at Maki`s strength and quickly tags Kai. Kai says, \"let me see who you really are!\" when she stops to protect Mio and the letters SS are written on her back!\nSource: crunchyroll",
