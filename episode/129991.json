  "description" : "Kinji quarrels with Aria, not believing her intuitions about Durandal, whom he believes, as do most, to be a myth. He goes on to try to protect Shirayuki by himself, not realising that Durandal has already contacted her secretly, and is threatening the students and Kinji in particular in exchange for her cooperation. He realises this almost too late, when he finds her about to give herself up to Durandal, who also seems to be working for EU, the same mysterious organisation Riko works for. Aria shows up then, saying that he served his purpose, and proceeds to try to apprehend Durandal.",
