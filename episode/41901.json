  "description" : "One morning, Akari wakes up to find the entire city flooded with water!  It`s the Acqua Alta, a once-a-year phenomenon where the water levels rise, causing all of Neo-Venezia to shut down for a day.  But while most people spend the day relaxing, Aika`s mentor Akira is as strict as ever, and yells at her to get back to training.  Aika has just the solution to get her mentor off her back: she`s running away to the Aria Company!\nSource: crunchyroll",
