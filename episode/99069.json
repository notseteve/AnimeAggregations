  "description" : "Oz leaves for the ceremony, while Gilbert is possessed by one of the death gods. As Oz makes an oath during the ceremony conducted by his uncle, Oscar, the clock (which was silent for 100 years), suddenly strikes. This brings the strange figures inside the sanctuary, preparing to take Oz away. The possessed Gilbert tries to kill Oz, and succeeds in stabbing him. Meanwhile, the girl from his vision (called Black Rabbit by the death gods) comes and fights them to save Oz from being pulled into the Abyss. Gilbert snaps out of the trance momentarily, sees one of the figures faces, and blocks Oz, who was trying to kill the intruders. Unfortunately, he slashes Gilbert across the chest. Oz is then taken into the Abyss for the sin of existing.",
