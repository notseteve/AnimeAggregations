  "description" : "Heavy rain keeps the girls from their usual gondola practice, so instead they spend the day at Himeya.  They start off studying at first, but when their minds drift off to what nicknames they`ll take as Primas, Akira steps in and gives them some good old-fashioned paperwork to do.  Even that can`t get Aika down, however... because she`s noticed lately that people whisper to each other when she walks past.  Does that mean she`s finally being recognized for her skills as an Undine?\nSource: crunchyroll",
