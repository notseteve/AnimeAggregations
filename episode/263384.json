  "description" : "When the new school term starts, Amane and Mahiru are put in the same class. At home, Amane makes meal requests and gives Mahiru gifts. The two neighbors` relationship is almost as intimate as if they were married. At school, however, Amane treats Mahiru like a stranger. When Mahiru notices how differently Amane treats Itsuki and Chitose, she gets the uncomfortable feeling that she is being left out. Mahiru tries to think of a way to gradually get closer to Amane.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
