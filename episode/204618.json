  "description" : "Despite the disappearance of the humans, the mice have continued their experiments believing strongly that it is their fate as experimental creatures, and they intend to use Midge and the others as part of their experiments. The mice plan to feed Midge and the others to the carnivorous plants in their space farm to see if they can produce an alternative source of energy. Midge does his best to fight off the mice before they can feed him to one of the plants, but ends up being cast out into space. Meanwhile, through a chance of luck, the frogs are unfrozen from their ice prison and start causing trouble too. Will the bugs ever make it off this terrifying space station?\nSource: crunchyroll",
