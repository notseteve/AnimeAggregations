  "description" : "The trading company wishing to purchase Holo proposes to pay with 60 gold coins instead of 2,000 silver coins because of their inability to procure the necessary silver, and Lawrence agrees to the deal. While celebrating the deal, Eve reveals she had been purchased and married to a merchant. She tells Lawrence and Holo to cherish their experiences together. Back at the inn, Holo suggests they should end their journey after she is sold since Lawrence has almost realized his dream of becoming a shop owner, and Lawrence`s efforts to dissuade her fail. The next morning, they return the books borrowed from Ligro, pausing to converse with a nun residing in Ligro`s home. Suddenly, Eve arrives and says there has been a coup d`état, leaving them surrounded by a rebellion.\nSource: Wikipedia",
