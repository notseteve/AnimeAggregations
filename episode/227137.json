  "description" : "It’s the top of the seventh inning in Seido’s game against Hachiya Oji.  Hachiya Oji has to score this inning or else the game will be called.  Kawabata fought his way to a base, but it would be Hachiya Oji’s last offensive.  Seido’s victory is imminent.  After hearing Furuya say he’d get to play next game, Sawamura watches the game from the bench, the number one on his back.  The story of these two players vying for the title of ace will continue.\nSource: crunchyroll",
