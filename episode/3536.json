  "description" : "Our class got to go to the ice rink for a field trip! Sakura was worried that she wouldn`t be good at ice skating, but I knew she would pick it up fast. And guess what? She did! The ice rink got really cold all of a sudden, though- so cold that we were all frozen! Luckily Sakura and Xiaolang were there, and saved us all from the Freeze card.\nSource: crunchyroll",
