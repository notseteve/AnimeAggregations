  "description" : "There is a high possibility that the irregularity in the guiding devices may have been due to internal hacking. Surrounded by Vajra, Lindow continues his lone battle. Lenka acquires a new God Arc and gets Lindow out of harm`s way in the knick of time. Reasoning that someone must have set another guiding device that suddenly distracted the Aragami, Lindow sets out to find and destroy it. But Deus Pita appears before him. It is an uphill battle for Lenka and Lindow, but the 1st Unit arrives to help. \nSource: crunchyroll",
