  "description" : "Unit 8 is down with a cold, and it`s up to West Japan`s Unit 9, led by Kazari, to save the day when a group of indignant movie fans takes over a production studio.  But the always over-active Kazari meets her match when the villains rig the streets surround the studio with sound-sensitive bombs, and post a Willwear sniper on the roof.   Can she come up with a way to take back the studio that doesn`t involve leveling the entire neighborhood?  And if not, who`s going to pay for it all?\nSource: crunchyroll",
