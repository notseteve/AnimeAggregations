  "description" : "Heaven`s forces try to maintain the barrier around the seal Bahamut as it beings to crumble. Elsewhere Favaro and Rita give chase to the demons who nabbed Amira and Kaisar though Favaro would rather leave them. In the demon Azazel`s foating fortress Amira is tortured for information about the God`s Key while Kaisar watches helplessly. Rita and Favaro manage to borrow the god Bacchus` flying carriage after Favaro proves his commitment by breaking his bounty hunter`s band, making him an ordinary outlaw. The two then manage to break into the fortress but get separated when Azazel goads Kaisar into fighting Favaro though Rita quickly breaks up the fight. Jeanne d`Arc`s Knights ambush the demon fortress, causing a diversion that allows Favaro, Rita and Kaisar to rescue Amira only to end up before Azazel. Favaro realizes Azazel is the demon responsible for his father`s death. When Azazel attacks Amira a mysterious force within her blows him off the fortress, sending him tumbling below, though he now understands who sent her.\nSource: Wikipedia",
