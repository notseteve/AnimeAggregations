  "description" : "The false Terminal Services man came to Souta while Marsha was out shopping, but Souta told him this, but he had his misgivings and contacted Isla and Tsukasa about the incident, and they agree that the man must be a black market retriever. Tsukasa, Isla, Michiru, and Zack begin their search for Marsha, knowing that her time is running out and that she might soon turn into a Wanderer, a berserk android, if they are unable to get to her in time. Yamanobe has called his superior and he authorises R Security, a private security firm contracted by SAI, to handle the issue as well.\nThey spend all night searching but find no leads until the next morning they learn where the black marketeers are conducting their business. They are stopped by R Security personnel from entering the area but Kazuki admonishes their commander, reminding him of the heavy-handed way they dealt with the retrieval of the android that had stood as Michiru`s guardian, who had also turned into a Wanderer, and they are allowed to pass. They find the false Terminal Services man, who has been beaten unconscious, and Marsha, who has indeed turned into a Wanderer. Souta wanders into the area, and is attacked by Marsha, forcing Tsukasa to shoot her with a Terminator, a weapon capable of completely disrupting an android`s software.",
