  "description" : "Grandpa seasons B.B.B.`s dinner with Change Essence, an invention that he claims will make even the spiciest foods taste sweet... but when B.B.B. and Gabriel smell the powder and sneeze, instead of changing the food`s essence, B.B.B.`s essence ends up in Gabriel`s body and vice versa! The two of them have no choice but to live each other`s lives until Grandpa invents a cure. Will they ever return to their own bodies?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
