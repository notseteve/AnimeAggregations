  "description" : "Weather girl Ms. Ketsuno is giving the wrong weather forecast. Turns out she comes from a line of traditional Onmyojis, and her forecast is not derived from mere fortune-telling but actually by using her Onmyoji powers. But her weather forecast is being sabotaged by someone who is unhappy with Ms. Ketsuno’s career as a weather girl despite her being an Onmyoji. Gintoki and the gang arrive at the Onmyoji mansion where they come face to face with Seimei, Ms. Ketsuno’s older brother.\nSource: crunchyroll",
