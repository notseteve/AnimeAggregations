Later that night at the Narumi Detective Agency, run by chief Akiko Narumi, a client named Chuuta Tsubosaki asks the agency`s help in finding a self-proclaimed witch, who he had fallen in love with after she stole his bag. Believing it to be the same woman from earlier, Shotaro goes to investigate and eventually manages to chase down the woman in question, Tokime. She manages to escape, however, as Shotaro suddenly finds himself in a middle of a building belonging to the Tachikawa Group, later learning from the police that one of Tachikawa`s men was allegedly murdered by Tokime. The next day, Shotaro and Chuuta track down Tokime and chase her down into a strange alternate version of Fuuto, where they come under attack by an unseen assailant. It is at this point that Shotaro`s partner, Philip, arrives on the scene.",
