  "description" : "An email from Pinocchimon appears on the computer used by the robot club at Tagiru`s school. Pinocchimon shows Tokio and the other club members a blueprint and some parts and asks them to help him build a robot, luring them to the Digimon world, DigiQuartz. From that day onward, Tokio and the other club members turn up absent from school. As requested by the teacher, Tagiru visits Tokio`s house accompanied by Taiki and Yuu. When he sees Tokio working on building a robot as if possessed, Tagiru grows suspicious and decides to observe his movements. Tagiru and the others then watch as Tokio opens an email and enters DigiQuartz through a portal that opens in his computer screen! They rush after him and find themselves in an industrial area in DigiQuartz. They call upon the strengths of their Digimon companions Gumdramon and Shoutmon to locate Tokio and resume the chase. When they follow Tokio into a factory, they find a nearly completely assembled GigaBreakdramon...?!\nTagiru and the others try to bring Tokio back from DigiQuartz, but at that moment Pinocchimon appears and starts up GigaBreakdramon. A new battle begins - how will it end?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
