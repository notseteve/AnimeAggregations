  "description" : "Before Mayama starting working at the Fujiwara Design Office, Miwako becomes upset to see Yamazaki in a fashion magazine. It is explained that Miwako bought a shirt for Yamazaki as a practical joke device. However, the shirt seems to suit him well. Each day, Miwako attempts to give Yamazaki another shirt as a practical joke device, but she again fails to humiliate him, seeing him displayed the same fashion magazine. After Morita returned from America, Mayama plays shogi with Professor Hanamoto. When Takemoto and Hagu arrive, they all converse about Yamada in parties. It is explained that Yamada is the most attractive girl in every party, but she experiences love sickness after becoming drunk. Moreover, Mayama becomes responsible for caring for Yamada after every party. They then talk about Mayama time in the office. It is explained that Yamazaki was invited to a party. Miwako still becomes obsessed in trying to humiliate Yamazaki, only for him to be invited to many parties due to his popularity. Mayama and Professor Hanamoto, not realizing that Takemoto and Hagu both departed, ended up calling it a night, only to see Morita right in front of them. \nSource: Wikipedia",
