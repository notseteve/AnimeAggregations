  "description" : "The Guardians learn that Snoppe is missing and set out in search for her. However, there is not much time left before Mifuyu competes. Meanwhile, Nikaidou analyzes Mifuyu`s X Egg in a remote cabin, but is interrupted by Suzuki, Amu`s admirer. Later, Amu nearly runs into Suzuki and brings him back to the resort where he tells the Guardians about the egg he saw. The Guardians find the cabin, but Nikaidou is alerted to their presence. However, as he slips off, Amu catches a glimpse of him. When the guardians enter the cabin, Snoppe hatches from the egg as an X Character. Amu and Ran transform into Amulet Heart and purify Snoppe. Snoppe returns to Mifuyu and the two are finally able to compete and win the competition. As the group returns home, Amu begins to suspect that Nikaidou is the one creating the X Eggs.\nSource: crunchyroll",
