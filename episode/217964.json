  "description" : "Mamako and Masato are now registered as hero and mommy, and they decide to have an interview to decide who’ll join their party. Porter, a tiny merchant girl who comes to the interview, is a nice, kind-looking girl, so she’s allowed to join. The next girl on the list is the sage, Wise. Masato gets a bad feeling from her photograph and tries to get rid of it, but the photograph was actually Wise, herself, who had transformed into a sheet of paper. She gets mad at how she was treated and teleports Masato outside the city. When the two of them are alone, she tells him that the goal of this RPG is for mother and child to become closer. That’s why Mamako is so strong, and why she was brought to this world with him!\nSource: crunchyroll",
