  "description" : "An ordinary, run-of-the-mill salaryman, Satake Hirofumi, goes on a cruise with his business client, Kito Joji. They spend a fun time out on the sea, but the cruiser gets destroyed when a whale crashes into it. Satake and Kito evacuate on a lifeboat, but they`re adrift alone in the Pacific ocean. Provisions and water gone, they`re on the verge of death. The only thing left in Satake`s hand was a gift from his fiancée, Negishi Chie: A lucky coin pendant.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
