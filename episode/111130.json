  "description" : "Quinza appears before Noei, who is held captive in an underground prison.  Both of them want to put the future of Raginei into Rumaty’s hands, though the two disagree on their ideas of how to reach that goal.  Quinza comes to the realization that they will not agree on the issue and wants to execute Noei for a fallacious crime in order to gather momentum for the revolution. At the same time, Carl is heading to the palace along with his father, who is trying to take back Raginei from Burnsworth. On the way to the palace they are attacked by thieves. \nSource: crunchyroll",
