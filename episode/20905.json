  "description" : "Laura is preparing a very special celebration for Father`s Day! But her dad has been so busy at work these days, and he might not make it home in time to for the Father`s Day party. That`s no good! So Hamtaro and the Ham-Hams decide to make a visit to Forrest Haruna`s office and give him a hand. Maybe they can help him work faster! Pretty soon the Ham-Hams even know how to use a photocopying machine. \nSource: Wikipedia",
