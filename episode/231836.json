  "description" : "Ash and Goh have Fossil Pokémon on their mind and Chloe has a science project, so it’s off to the Pewter Museum of Science! There, they meet a man who bears an uncanny resemblance to the excavation leader our heroes met in Unova. But he insists he’s the Museum of Science curator!\nExploring the fossil dig, our heroes find all sorts of ancient artifacts—even a piece of Old Amber!\nBut Team Rocket is up to its old tricks. When they secretly try to operate a Fossil Pokémon Restorer Machine, it explodes!\nMeanwhile, Goh has his eye on a feisty Aerodactyl. After some fierce battling, Goh gently asks if they can become friends. Aerodactyl agrees, and Goh winds up with a brand-new, ancient Pokémon friend!\nSource: Official Website",
