  "description" : "On the way, Hyakkimaru senses an unusual evil air when he passes by a cow-drawn cart. The cart is drawn by the warrior Sabame riding with his wife Maimaionba. She also senses something extraordinary about Hyakkimaru, and asks Sabame to kill him. Hyakkimaru dodges the attack, and sneaks into the house of Maimaionba to find out what she really is. In the basement, he finds numerous moth eggs. They are all Maimaionba`s eggs. As it turns out, she is a huge moth-monster with silver powder.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
