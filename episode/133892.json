  "description" : "When Tagiru`s classmate Miho Sudo grows jealous of the school`s higher-ranked honor students, she ends up possessed by a Digimon! The next day something strange happens to the top two honor students, Mishima and Takahashi, in the middle of class. Their skin suddenly turns brown and they appear to wither, as if something is sucking the nutrients out of them. Sensing that this is a Digimon`s doing, Tagiru warps to the Digimon world, DigiQuartz. There he sees strange things that look like plant vines scattered throughout the school and wrapped around Mishima and Takahashi, as if to conceal them. Tagiru and Gumdramon attempt to find out just how far the vines reach. Just then the Digimon Hunter Ren appears and tells Tagiru that the vines themselves are a Digimon, and a very strong one that keeps its true form hidden. When Ren has his Digimon partner Dracmon bite through a vine, Miho, back in the real world, appears to feel intense pain. Then the Digimon that had wrapped itself completely around Miho and assimilated her body, Blossomon, appears!\nWhen Miho and Blossomon warp to DigiQuartz, a fierce battle with Tagiru and company begins!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
