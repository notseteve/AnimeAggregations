  "description" : "A guided tour of the Final Four’s quarters leaves Shirogane feeling empty, prompting her to explain to Arlequino the true nature of “joy”. Meanwhile, Masaru, Lise and Gryphon are pursing Faceless’s airship, until a bolt of lightning sends them tumbling into a dense fog. When they come to, they are in front of Mont Saint-Michel, Faceless’s main base. However, wild beast tamer Dr. Lao is also there.\nSource: Amazon",
