  "description" : "Hans, a palace guard in Aitheria, is taken by his associate Nikolaus to a strange pub known only as Nobu. He steps inside only to find himself surrounded by an exotic ambience. It is here that he meets reticent Chief Nobuyuki and his cute server, Shinobu. Hans anxiously waits to be served, and is eventually confronted with a strange, gold drink referred to as “whatsontap,” and a warm dish called “oden,” neither of which he’s ever seen before.\nSource: crunchyroll",
