  "description" : "Sakuta sees a familiar Miniskirt Santa on a beauty pageant website that his friend Takumi Fukuyama was looking at. However, he notices that her name isn’t listed as Touko Kirishima, but rather as Nene Iwamizawa. As he continues his search for Touko Kirishima, he receives an offer of help from Sara, which he accepts. One of the symptoms of her Puberty Syndrome includes knowing what a person she has collided with is thinking, and that’s how she figured out that Sakuta was looking for Touko Kirishima. Sara suggests reading the Miniskirt Santa’s mind at the venue where she’ll perform her new song live on Christmas Eve.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
