  "description" : "Amane`s studying pays off and he reaches sixth place with his midterm exam scores. Mahiru had promised to do anything he asked if he reached the top ten, and Amane somewhat reluctantly ends up laying in her lap again. Mahiru smiles at Amane as he eventually gives in and falls asleep at her hands. Not long after, Mahiru also falls asleep. When Amane wakes up and has to carry the half-asleep Mahiru back to her own room, she unwittingly invites him to sleep next to her in bed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
