  "description" : "On their way to the Rose Morning Star, the gang made an unscheduled stop at the Great Trailmon Race. Everyone decided to join the festivities and partnered up with a Trailmon. Bokomon was a little too busy playing `mother hen` to participate. During the wacky ride, ShadowWereGarurumon & Dogmon used all kinds of nasty tricks to take the gang out, one by one. Finally, Takuya Beast Spirit Evolved to BurningGreymon and gave that mean old wolf & his mutt a taste of their own medicine. With the two of them out of the way, Takuya & Worm crossed the finish line first!\nSource: crunchyroll",
