  "description" : "What started as a tropical cruise takes a turn for the strange as the group lands in Mafia Land, a resort island that has an amusement park and a beach. Despite the ominous mafia connection, Tsuna is happy to see that the island appears normal, but Reborn tells him that there are formalities for entering the island...like taking a mafia exam that involves handing over bribes! Naturally, Tsuna fails, and ends up being taken to Secret Mafia Land, where Colonnello, a baby who`s an old friend of Reborn, awaits.\nSource: crunchyroll",
