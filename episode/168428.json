  "description" : "Kagami/The First goes online one last time, telling Koutarou/Luce that he won`t be online for a while. He goes into town by himself for the first time. Meanwhile in school Kagami reminds Seijurou of how Luce had given him a beating in the game, putting him up to going online and confronting him. In the town Luce gets a lot of attention now that The First is not with him. A group of players try to harass him, but Seijurou, not caring about the rules prohibiting violence in the town, hits them, and he takes Luce aside for another duel. The town guard arrives and fights Seijurou briefly before the system penalises his account for breaking the rules. They speak briefly, and Koutarou reveals his identity, asking him to keep it a secret, but they are overheard by Kisaki.\nKisaki visits Koutarou in his house, and drags him outside and she buys him new clothes. Koutarou attracts plenty attention though he is a boy, and Kisaki tries to get him to come to school and see Seijurou in person. A pair of punks tries to harass them along the way but Makina is nearby and saves them, and invites them to her home. Koutarou is touched by their kindness and he begins to think that coming to school with such people around might not be so bad.\nMeanwhile, Kagami tracks down the Koutarou`s former schoolmates who bullied him before, and invites them to the victory party he is setting up.",
