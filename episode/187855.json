  "description" : "One day, Hinako returns from school to find a letter from her mother. In it, her mother says she`d be visiting Tokyo to see Hinako acting. But Hinako is worried that she`ll get nervous and freeze up like a scarecrow if she knows her mother is watching, not to mention she hasn`t appeared on a stage since the culture festival. She even gets embarrassed just being seen working at the Hitotose coffee shop. Then she finds out about a stamp rally event planned in the shopping district, and she suggests having their troupe perform at Hitotose for it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
