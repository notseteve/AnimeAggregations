  "description" : "With Kero stuffed into her bag, Sakura joined her family (and Yukito) on a trip to a summer home her father was borrowing. Near the house, Sakura met an elderly man named Masaki living in an especially large home in the area, and they became fast friends. She visited him again the next day, and gave her a dress that used to belong to his now deceased granddaughter. Sakura was trying to think of some way to repay his kindness when she remembered the painting of a rainbow she`d seen in his granddaughter`s room. On the day she was set to leave, she asked Masaki to stand on his balcony and look up at the sky, then used her Rain card to create an impromptu rainbow. How sweet of her! And as it turned out, the painting had been done by Nadeshiko, and Masaki was actually Sakura`s great grandfather!\nSource: crunchyroll",
