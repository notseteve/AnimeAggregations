Later, as July goes off to search for his misplaced \"Bloody Bible\", the other girls reflect on how he, despite his odd behavior, has been helping them all this time. While retrieving his book, July comes across an alumni named Kiryuu Hajime, who seems to share his passion for chuunibyou naming. He is later revealed to be Tomoyo`s older half-brother who left home a year ago. The next day, honorary literature club member Himeki Chifuyu appears before July, stating she has quit elementary school.\nSource: Wikipedia",
