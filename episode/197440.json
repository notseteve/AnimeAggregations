  "description" : "Books containing the intense emotions of the author, sometimes with the power to force the death of their readers, these books are known as \"cursed tomes\". The role of the Imperial Library Intelligence Asset Management Bureau, nicknamed Fukurou, is finding and retrieving these books. As a result of the incident with her brother, Tsugumi has gained the ability to see the auras around cursed tomes and decides to join Fukurou to put her new powers to use. However, she finds Fukurou full of rather unique members such as Ozaki Hayato with a sharp-tongue and a strong sense of justice, Kougami Akira who has difficulty with people, and Hoshikawa Hisui with mismatched eye colors.\nSource: crunchyroll",
