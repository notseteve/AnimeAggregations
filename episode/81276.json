  "description" : "Ryohei is in danger. He has injured his left hand and is dehydrated because of the heat from the lights. He receives permission from Colonnello to use his Maximum Cannon, a right-fisted recovery technique that he had been saving for when he`s at an extreme disadvantage. But his techniques are blocked by Lussuria`s metal knee. Ryohei receives a brutal injury to his right arm and collapses. Kyoko`s tears and the promise that he made to her when they were little get him back on his feet. “I won`t lose,” he says. His feelings for his younger sister complete his Maximum Cannon. Light shines from his right fist, and the light breaks Lussuria`s perfect defense!\nSource: crunchyroll",
