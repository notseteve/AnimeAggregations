  "description" : "When a bullying group of middle school students refuse to give up the soccer field, Karin Kurosaki fearlessly agrees to lead her reluctant friends into a soccer match against the upperclassmen. The team that wins the game will gain the right to use the field while the losing team will have to eat the grass. With a hopeless squad of cowards on her team, Karin recruits the help of Soul Reaper Captain Toshiro Hitsugaya, who surprisingly knows a thing or two about soccer.\nSource: crunchyroll",
