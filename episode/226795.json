  "description" : "Gengar has resumed its pranks on the Cerise Laboratory…giving our heroes another opportunity to catch it! But when Ash suddenly comes down with a case of bad luck, Goh says it could be Gengar’s curse. Ash goes for a jog to try to snap out of it, and he runs into Gengar’s former Trainer—prompting Gengar itself to emerge from Ash’s shadow! Gengar is furious because its Trainer abandoned it long ago, but after helping Ash and Pikachu battle Team Rocket, it makes it clear that it now wants to join Ash’steam. Ash is happy to oblige—and Gengar’s anger finally subsides!\nSource: Official Website",
