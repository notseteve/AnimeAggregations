  "description" : "Lenka and Alisa are in desperate straits, as they are deep in an area swarming with Vajra. Lenka`s God Arc was broken in the battle with the Dyaus Pita and is no longer effective against Aragami, and Alisa`s was lost. After resting and treating their injuries in a ruined building they search for Alisa`s God Arc. Alisa recalls in her mind how she had seen the Pita before, and how it had murdered her parents. They find Alisa`s weapon in a stream. As she picks it up, she is surrounded by several Vajra, but is frozen in terror as the memory of her parents` deaths haunts her. Rindou arrives just in time to save them.",
