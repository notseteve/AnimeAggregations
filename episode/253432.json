  "description" : "Even after Professor Ikeda recommends that Ibarada proceed on a doctoral course, she can`t make up her mind about what she wants to do. But after experiencing a little of Professor Ikeda`s deep love for strength training, she strives to complete some sit ups, an activity she isn`t used to doing, on the sofa. As she does, Kosuke looks on in fascination.\nMeanwhile, Himuro has caught a cold due to the changing of the seasons. Worried for her, Yukimura goes to her apartment to check on her, but the flush and heat of her fever has given her a coquettish appearance that sends Yukimura`s heart racing. At that very moment, Kanade shows up and Himuro promptly hides Yukimura under her comforter.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
