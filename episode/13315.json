  "description" : "The king’s soldiers’ number has grown to 20,000, and the Royal Amy’s in Kankyu, 30,000.  Shoryu is among the enemy’s soldiers, and he sees the king’s soldiers send workers to build a dike for Rokusui River.  Atsuyu suspects that the king’s soldiers are trying to flood his castle, and orders his man to cut the dike in the upper reach of the river to sink a town.  Atsuyu’s female officer, Meishin, tells Rokuta that Atsuyu has changed and helps him escape.  Rokuta wanders into the underground maze and runs into Gen State’s Leader and his double whose tongue was cut off.  Meishin questions Atsuyu’s move to sink a town and Koya cold-heartedly feeds her to his monster.\nSource: crunchyroll",
