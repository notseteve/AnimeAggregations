  "description" : "Ribbon gets upset at Hime when she doesn`t want to eat her home cooking and has lunch at Yuko`s house instead. Wanting Hime to understand the feelings behind cooking, Yuko asks her to help out at her family`s bento shop, where she learns how much hard work goes into preparing food for others. Just as Megumi brings Ribbon over so Hime can apologize, Namakeruda appears with a Bento Saiark to target the shop. Determined to protect the shop, Hime understands the effort Ribbon puts into her cooking and fights back with her Macademia HulaDance form, allowing Megumi to defeat the Saiark. Afterwards, Hime apologizes to Ribbon for her behavior and the two manage to make up with each other.\nNote: Cure Egret celebrates the 10th anniversary. The opening features the first set of scenes from the upcoming Pretty Cure All Stars New Stage 3 Eternal Friends.",
