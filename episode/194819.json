  "description" : "Only one month left until the school festival! All the roles have been decided, but just as their excitement builds, Ryo is suddenly surprised by the return of his father and the shocking news that he and his family will be living in London starting in January. Feeling lost and reluctant to speak with his friends, Ryo begins acting strangely to the degree that Seiichirou, Yuu, and Shunsuke take notice. While the boys stay over at Seiichirou`s house to get some progress done on their production, the four others have planned a special surprise birthday party to hopefully cheer up Ryo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
