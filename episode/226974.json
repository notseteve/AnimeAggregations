  "description" : "Mazama Jin here. As much as it pains me to admit it, I`m part of a stupid mutt`s pack at Seton Academy. Being with someone really is a challenge. It`s a different story when two people are bound to each other by fate, like Hitomi-chan and me, but most aren`t like that. And going out of one`s way to try to accomplish something so difficult is just foolish. But now I`ve been forced to think that might not always be the case.... after watching all the animals at this school. As much as it pains me to admit it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
