  "description" : "Himekawa needs more power to fight against the tri-headed dragon that caused her so much trauma in her past.  But the pleasure of the Climax Hybrid goes against the strict and disciplined life that she`s forced on herself after she failed to protect the people boarding the Tokyo megafloat.  It`s up to Kizuna to break down the walls she`s built up for herself, and teach her to enjoy the ecstasy she needs to defeat the enemy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
