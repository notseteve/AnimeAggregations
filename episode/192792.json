  "description" : "As Oh Fuuki and the others are escaping the Tosan theater they encounter the Four Heavenly Kings and dispose of all but one easily. The remaining member, known as the Hundred Youkai King, proves to be especially challenging and without a single magical tool at his disposal, Oh Fuuki runs away leaving Seito and the others to handle things on their own. Meanwhile, with Koko`s consciousness under Touhou Gessho`s control, Suusu has returned to normal. Having subdued the Northern Mountain Emperor, Yaya has gone off to deal with the leader of the black fox spirits, but some surprising words from Sashi encourage him to break his icey prison.\nSource: crunchyroll",
