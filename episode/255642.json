  "description" : "The pirate rebellion that has shaken the Land of Water is brought under control. Upon returning with his friends to the Hidden Leaf Village, Boruto wonders what happened to Ikada. Buntan and her friends are acquitted thanks to Kagura’s petition, but there is still no decision on what to do about Ikada. Boruto hopes for leniency, but Kawaki takes an opposite stance. As Boruto thinks about the people who got involved in the battle and Kawaki’s take on things, Naruto has a word with him.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
