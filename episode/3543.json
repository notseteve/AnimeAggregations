  "description" : "Yukito was chosen to represent his school at a big archery competition. Sakura decided to do something really nice for him, and made a whole bunch of lunch boxes! We were surprised to find out that Ms. Mizuki was in the competition too. It ended up being her and Yukito in the finals, but Ms. Mizuki was distracted on her last shot and lost.
