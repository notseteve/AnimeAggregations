  "description" : "Tama works hard everyday starting early in the morning. Even when Otose tells her to take a break, Tama won’t and says she is happy just being with everyone. But Otose notices that Tama’s appearance has changed into that of an angular polygon from an old video game! While Otose and Gintoki discuss that it must have been brought on by overwork, Tama returns from shopping and has now regressed from polygons to pixels!! Why is she going through these changes? And will she be able to return to normal?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
