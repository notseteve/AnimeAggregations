  "description" : "Nayu cannot hide her distress with Kiyono Amahara as a member of the Underwear Society. Kiyono is a troublemaker who drives off Komachi by lifting her skirt and throws out her underwear when Yako calls it plain. In an attempt to preserve the light atmosphere of the Underwear Society, Nayu suggests they assemble a bra from scratch, knowing even Komachi can participate comfortably. The other girls learn more about Kiyono when she begins discussing underwear design and makeup.\nSource: crunchyroll",
