  "description" : "It`s supposed to be his own room, a place he`s supposed to be used to seeing, but Subaru can`t shake the feeling that something is off. He`s overcome by an indescribable sense of uneasiness, but being caught in his father Kenichi`s armlock shakes it away. Subaru is stunned, but retaliates with a wrestling move of his own. As the two of them carry on, Subaru`s mother, Nahoko, informs them that she`s hungry and they should all eat breakfast together.\nSource: crunchyroll",
