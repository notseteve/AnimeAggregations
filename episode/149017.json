  "description" : "Hayate shops in a poverty district then experiences his misfortune. The story goes back in the daily life at the Violet Mansion apartment, where Hayate and Hinagiku make an early morning preparation. Maria notices how Hayate can be so popular with the girls. The tenants; Chiharu, Kayura, and Ayumu leave for school as Nagi gets up late despite Hayate`s actions to wake her when she`s been trying her best to do better in life. Athena Tennousu (as Alice in child-form) barely stays awake. After school, Nagi attempts to play video games when they all should be studying for their final exam. Hayate continues his hard work preparing for tomorrow already then begins studying after midnight and Hinagiku comes to his room to tutor him, and he wakes up for just an hour of sleep and does the same early morning routine. Unfortunately, he discovers everyone is sick; except Ayumu until she fakes it. The next day, Hayate caught their cold but pretends he`s fine to relieve Nagi’s worries. Ruka returns from Las Vegas and gives Hayate her album since her concert has finished. By the time Hakuou Academy`s final exam starts Hayate arrives miserable due to constant errands along the way. He returns home and finds everyone has prepared dinner for him as a way of thanking him for his kindness.\nSource: Wiki",
