  "description" : "Tanaka Shiro is worried about Kamikishiro Naoko because she disappeared, so he went to ask Niitoki Kei from the disciplinary committee for help. Kei just figured Naoko was skipping again, but Tanaka tells her that Naoko had her reasons for not showing up to school. Saotome Masami happens to hear them talking and tells them that they should talk to Kirima Nagi. Naoko and Nagi are good friends and she might know something. The three of them then go to look for Nagi.\nSource: crunchyroll",
