  "description" : "In the final round of the Battle Arena Toshinden tournament, Eiji Shinjo faces the tournament`s sponsor, Gaia, in Mortal Kombat. Gaia mentions that Eiji`s skills are comparable to those of his long-lost brother, Sho, but before he can explain, the fight is interrupted by a man called Chaos, who works for the same Organization as Gaia and has been sent to eliminate him upon discovering that Gaia is rallying fighters to overthrow the Organization. Gaia slays Chaos and flees, leaving the tournament without a winner.\nA year later, both Sho and Chaos, the latter having apparently survived his fight with Gaia, working for the Organization`s leader, Lady Uranus, begin hunting down the fighters from the tournament, such as Fo Fai, Rungo Iron and Mondo. Eiji, along with his best friend Kayin Amoh, split up to warn the other competitors. Eiji meets up with Sofia, an amnesiac agent and personal friend of his, and explains the situation to her. That night, however, Uranus takes control of Sofia`s mind and has her try to kill Eiji, but Eiji fights back and breaks Uranus`s hold on her. Sho himself then appears and does battle with Eiji, quickly gaining the upper hand, but Eiji discovers that Sho is actually a machine and overpowers him. Uranus appears and destroys Sho, goading Eiji before taking her leave. Enraged, Eiji vows to take Uranus and the Organization down.\nSource: EN Wikipedia",
