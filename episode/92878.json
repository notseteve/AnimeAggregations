  "description" : "At the start, the Embryo is shown floating in the sky near Amu`s house. Su notices it, then Kiseki has it fly past him. With this encounter, the Guardian Characters (including Daichi) decide to go on a quest to find the Embryo. Meanwhile, the workers of Easter are continuing their efforts to obtain the Embryo. They try to put a tracker on Ikuto to follow his movements, but he notices and places it on Yoru for comedic effect. Eventually, the quest of the Guardian Characters leads them to the worker`s place. Su, who had separated from the group, met up with Amu and the others and lead them to where the Guardian Characters are. They discovered an X Egg, and Amu Character Transformed to Amulet Clover to purify it. At the end, Ikuto throws back the tracker to Kazuomi and walks away.\nSource: crunchyroll",
