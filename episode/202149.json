  "description" : "Ashibe-kun and his friends are visiting a ranch! Sugao-kun comes along too, so Ashibe-kun introduces him to everyone and asks them all to be his friends! Since Sugao-kun lived among the wildlife of the Republic of Asnikul for so long, all the animals on the ranch love him. He can even ride a horse! Amazing! But Sakata doesn`t seem too fond of Sugao-kun for some reason. Can the two of them become friends?\nSource: crunchyroll",
