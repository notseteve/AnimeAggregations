  "description" : "Just as Riko is getting ready to fight Aria and Kinji, she is tased from behind by Sayonaki, who turns out to not only be a scientist working on a eugenic programme of which Riko had been a part, but actually Vlad himself, as her despair makes him transform into his monster form. Aria and Kinji find themselves in an impossible position as their bullets fail to harm Vlad, as they do not know where his fourth weak spot is. Kinji attempts to get Riko away before returning to the battle, and she tells him that she believes his fourth weak spot is in his chest. They try to do this, but it does not work, and Kinji`s Hysteria Mode wears off, but not before he notices something important. He nearly falls off the building in Vlad`s counter-attack, but Riko manages to save him using her parachute-dress, and they circle around and pick up Aria. Between them they have four guns with one shot each. Kinji lands with his face on Aria`s chest and this restores his Hysteria Mode, and they attack Vlad one last time. Kinji noticed how Vlad attempted to protect his mouth the last time they shot at him, and he correctly deduced that was where his fourth weak spot was, and that way they manage to kill him.\nAfterwards, Riko makes her escape, but keeps her promise to testify on Aria`s mother`s behalf.",
