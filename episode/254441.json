  "description" : "The final ranking match between Ryo and Matsuda begins! No matter where Matsuda aims his shots, Ryo tenaciously returns them, and the frustration causes Matsuda to set aside his normally cool play in favor of recklessly chasing down the shuttle. The other team members who have finished their matches can`t take their eyes off the game. How will their back and forth match end? And what will be the results of the ranking matches?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
