  "description" : "Isagi`s team has lost to Rin`s team, who has incredible skills and an overwhelming ego. Isagi and Nagi lose to Bachira, and they are sent back to the second stage of two-on-two games. Showing up before them is the team of Barou and Naruhaya. Losing means disqualification. With that pressure, Isagi and Nagi think hard on their individual strengths to win a one-on-one situation. The new match that decides their fate starts with no answer in sight.\nSource: crunchyroll",
