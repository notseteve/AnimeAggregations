  "description" : "Grani is fully developed. Calumon tries to help awake Jeri. Meanwhile, Beelzemon, released by the D-Reaper, tries to break open the kernel sphere in which Jeri is with no results. He`s joined by Gallantmon who manages to use Grani`s Yugooth Blaster to destroy the Agent guarding it. Kazu and Kenta are nearly killed, but are saved by Antylamon. During the battle, the adults learn the truth of the Bio-Merging and are shocked. The shots of the kids inside the Digimon is somehow broadcast on live TV and Ms. Asaji leads Takato`s entire class in cheering him on once she sees this. Finally Beelzemon manages to break through to Jeri by using Leomon`s Fist of the Beast King attack (its indicated with the help of Leomon`s spirit) and Jeri finally wakes up, but grows depressed when she realizes its Beelzemon and not Leomon coming to save her. She eventually tries to reach Beelzemon, but its too late and the Kernel Sphere closes up again and Beelzemon is struck down by the D-Reaper and falls towards the Chaos Mass.\nSource: crunchyroll",
