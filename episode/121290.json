  "description" : "Tsuna is almost crushed by Byakuran’s power. The two of them keep firing back at each other with increasingly bigger Deathperation Flames. Then, out of nowhere, Tsuna’s and Byakuran’s rings begin to resonate very loudly. Yuni is in hiding far away from them, but her pacifier starts to fire Deathperation Flames and make the same noise as well. Reborn thinks that the Sky elements are contacting one another. Yuni floats up into the air, and she is taken in the direction of Byakuran and Tsuna against her will. Yuni seems to be headed for danger. What is happening?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
