  "description" : "It is summer vacation, and Haruhi and Tsuruya have prepared an outing to the beach and the mountains for the Literature Club. Kyon`s little sister joins the seven of them on the trip. Kyon continues to feel very awkward to Yuki through most of the excursion, despite Ryoko`s and Tsuruya`s efforts to bring them together, until the test of courage where they are paired. They make their way to a mountain lake with many fireflies flying about, without realising that they have been holding hands in a rather romantic fashion.",
