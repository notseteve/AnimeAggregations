He is eventually challenged by Rook`s right hand man, Bishop, to face a puzzle in which he must manipulate lanes on a motorbike circuit to catch up to his opponent. Kaito and Nonoha are meanwhile approached by Elena, who tells them about Gammon joining the POG and gives Nonoha a puzzle which she solves herself.
