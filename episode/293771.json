  "description" : "Ami is a girl in her third year of high school who continues to be heartbroken due to her forbidden love with her stepbrother, Hiroshi. Ami was having the last summer vacation of her high school life while facing a lot of troubles, including her job as an idol, preparing to go to college, and her parents` divorce. The most shocking thing for her was that when Hiroshi, who was studying abroad in England, returned to Japan temporarily, he told her that they should end their romantic relationship.\nAmi makes plans to celebrate her 17th birthday in Sapporo a week later with her best friends Kyouko and Satomi, who suggested this in order to cheer up Ami, who is depressed without knowing Hiroshi`s true feelings. In the meantime, Ami puts an end to her life as an idol and her opaque relationship with Kouno, while being shaken by her feelings for Hiroshi.\nThe day before the trip, Ami finds a picture of her younger self in her stepbrother`s room inside the book titled First Love. The photo has a Hiroshi`s thought written on it: \"If Ami weren`t my sister...\" That was the answer Ami had been looking for. The next day, instead of going with her friends on their planned trip, Ami leaves for England, where Hiroshi was.\nNote 1: Double billed with Project A-Ko in cinemas, this movie is the conclusion of Ami`s story from the original Cream Lemon series. Due to its popularity and the disappointing commercial reception of Shin Cream Lemon, an alternate storyline, Ami Sore kara, was released from 1988 to 1990 in four OVAs with a different character design, staff and seiyuu. Since this was theatrically released, it`s free of erotic content.\nNote 2: This film is cataloged as episode 39 (the final episode) of Cream Lemon in Cream Lemon`s official website.",
