  "description" : "Matt doesn`t understand why they have to be in the DigitalWorld and we wants to leave RIGHT NOW! (Yes, he has BIG issues right now) MetalGarurumon and WarGreymon battle while Matt and Tai have a fist fight. This was Puppertmon`s plan all along, to get all the DigiDestined to destroy each other. A strange light suddenly appears and takes over Kari`s body. The kids find themselves flying through the air and are surrounded by computer images from the past. They learn that the crests represent the best quality each of them had four years ago. Finally, they are told how and why each of them where chosen to be a DigiDestined. If any of the kid`s special quality is ever lost, that child`s Digimon can no longer Digivolve. After that was all over, Kari returned to normal, but was very weak and tired. Matt still wants to be alone and leaves again. Mimi doesn`t want to go on with the goup either and stays behind too. Joe doesn`t think that Mimi will be safe by herself and stays with her. They rest of the group go on their way...once again leaving the group split up again.\nSource: crunchyroll",
