  "description" : "At last, the day of Reborn’s trial rolls around. Reborn tells them to bring all of the guardians to Namimori Island and then leaves. Tsuna notices that Reborn isn’t his usual self, and Tsuna can’t hide his confusion. When Tsuna and the others arrive at the assigned destination, Reborn tells everyone they are to fight him to the death. Reborn mercilessly kicks Tsuna who says he can’t fight him. Even when Tsuna falls unconscious, Reborn commands the other guardians to continue fighting him without regard for the fallen Tsuna.\nSource: crunchyroll",
