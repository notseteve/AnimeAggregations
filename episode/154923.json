  "description" : "Aikuro tells Ryuko about the Life Fibers that give the Goku Uniforms their unique properties, with Kamui being uniforms made entirely of Life Fibers. He goes on to explain that Isshin entrusted him to give Senketsu to Ryuko following his death. Meanwhile, Satsuki, who is frustrated that Ryuko wore a Kamui before her, puts on a Kamui named Junketsu that has been sealed away by her family. The next day, Satsuki confronts Ryuko in her Junketsu, overwhelming her with her new power and showing no shame in her appearance. After hearing Mako`s advice that she should get completely naked, Ryuko comes to understand the true nature of a Kamui and unleashes its full power, allowing her to fight on equal ground with Satsuki. After Ryuko vows to crush Satsuki`s ambitions in order to get the answers she seeks, Satsuki challenges her with facing every student she throws at her until they once again meet.",
