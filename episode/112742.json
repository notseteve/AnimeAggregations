  "description" : "The entrance ceremony for Raira Academy. The students` varied mix of emotions swell. As they prepare for the new journey that lays before them, some meekly introduce themselves. One says he`s quitting school even though they`ve just begun. A seat where he should be sitting sits empty. Amidst all this, Kamichika Rio is there. A girl with a dark side to her. A crack suddenly opens atop this otherwise normal world. The girl who spots this should have died two days prior.\nSource: crunchyroll",
