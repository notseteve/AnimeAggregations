  "description" : "This time, it`s the True History about Halloween. However, the place they arrive is the Tottori Desert in the 4th year of the Meiji Era. Tokio and Calen meet the host, Fukuzawa-san, who they think they`ve seen before. Apparently people mistake Tottori and Shimane quite often, so he holds a quiz about them. It starts on October 31st... Wait, does that mean \"trick or treat\" was originally \"Tottori or Shimane\"? Akudarma won`t allow for such a punny history, so they also participate in the quiz...\nSource: crunchyroll",
