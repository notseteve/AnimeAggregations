  "description" : "As snow softly covers Neo-Venezia, Akari and Alicia are out for a walk.  Akari asks Alicia what she thought as a child - back then, what did she want to be like when she grew up?  But in response, Alicia just begins to roll a ball of snow on the ground.  As they walk around the city pushing the snowball, it grows bigger and bigger, to the point where people remark on it everywhere they go.  Alicia only continues to smile, but it`s certain that her answer is hidden there somewhere.\nSource: crunchyroll",
