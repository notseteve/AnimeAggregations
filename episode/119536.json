  "description" : "Stark shows no sign of getting serious in his battle against Love and Rose. Running out of patience, Lilinette begins to mindlessly fire at the two Visoreds without Stark’s permission. But her attacks prove to be ineffective against the two, and she is gradually cornered by the pair’s fine team play. Finally, Love hits Stark with his Zanpakuto attack, and the Espada is thrown into a sea of flames.\nSource: crunchyroll",
