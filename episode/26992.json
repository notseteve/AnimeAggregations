  "description" : "Ichigo and Ishida have their hands full with hordes of Hollows.  During the battle, the story of the annihilation of the Quincy is told, and the reason why Ishida hates Soul Reapers becomes clear. Although at first, Ishida insists on fighting alone, the sheer number of Hollows has him worried.  Ichigo then explains his reasons for fighting and suggests they join forces.  Ishida is hesitant, but then a formidable new enemy appears before them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
