  "description" : "Tomoyo recalls how she first met July during her chunibyo days. Hatoko tries to follow a magazine`s advice to get July to fall for her during their vacation, though not to much success. Upon his return, July invites Tomoyo to a summer festival where they talk things out and watch the fireworks together, leading Tomoyo to realise she is also in love with July. The next day, Mirei, who was captured by Hitomi the previous night, summons the literature club members together and steals Hatoko`s ability, using it against her. \nSource: Wikipedia",
