  "description" : "The unexpected stalemate at the Iserlohn Corridor urges the Imperial Headquarters to muster a reinforcement fleet to be immediately sent in support of Reuenthal. Or at least this is what the Imperial crews believe... but as the fleet jumps out from subspace, it becomes clear that Iserlohn is not their destination. Then Mittermeyer, commander of the fleet, announces that they are about to turn the page in the book of history. On Fezzan, people are staring overhead with anxiety as the sky is filled with ships.\nSource: crunchyroll",
