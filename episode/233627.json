  "description" : "Yotsuya has succeeded in saving the other party members with Kahvel`s help. Kahvel agrees to accompany them to Radodorbo if they`ll allow her to train them in swordsmanship, since they are the players and therefore can`t die. They encounter a village of goblins on the way and engage them in battle. Hakozaki, who only slowed everyone down in battle before due to her lack of strength and resignation, finally finds her resolve and manages to slay a goblin on her own.\nSource: crunchyroll",
