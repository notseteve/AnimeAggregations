  "description" : "Is she the typical wealthy, capricious type? For Hayate’s birthday, Nagi declares to get a part time job to save up money to buy him a watch. All those present were surprised to hear this but Hinagiku currently works part-time at the coffee shop, “Donguri\". The manager of “Donguri” calls Hayate and mentions that they are currently looking for someone to take Hinagiku’s place. Hayate already has a job as a butler so he’s a bit hesitant but Maria, thinking on her toes, encourages this so he can work at “Donguri” with Nagi. Nishizawa-san also works there. This is Nagi’s first part-time job, how will she handle it?\nSource: crunchyroll",
