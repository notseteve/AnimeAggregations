  "description" : "Miss Kobayashi and the others go to the beach. But Lucoa`s immediately dragged off by one of the lifeguards for her overly skimpy swimsuit. After regrouping, they put sunscreen on each other, split a watermelon, go swimming together, and enjoy summer to the fullest. After the beach, it`s comiket!
