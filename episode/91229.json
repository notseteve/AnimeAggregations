  "description" : "Rito is about to have the worse ‘meet the parent’ experience in the whole universe! Lala’s father, King Deviluke is coming to earth to see if Rito is worthy of being his daughter’s future husband and eventual ruler of their planet.  At school, Rito meets a strange girl on the roof, who turns out to be Lala’s father testing him.  Having made a very bad first impression, it looks like Rito is about to learn about intergalactic pain, until Lala steps in.  Now, Rito is left with only one option to save himself and the earth from total destruction: become the Greatest Man in the Universe.\nSource: crunchyroll",
