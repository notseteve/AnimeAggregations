  "description" : "Manami and Aoi watch Kio and Eris, both waiting for a good time to make their move. As they are waiting, however, Itokazu and \"Beautiful Contact\" attack Kio and Eris, and are about to kill both of them when Aoi disobeys orders to wait and saves Kio. She then moves to kill Eris, but Kio begs the Momiji (not knowing it is Aoi) to spare her. She obliges, but as soon as she leaves, Manami appears with CIA back-up, knocks Kio out and captures Eris, but not before Kio sees Manami`s watch and knows it is her.\n \nLater, Kio confronts Manami and begs her to help him find Eris. Manami contacts Aoi for extra help, and, receiving help from his uncle, Kio blackmails Itokazu and Beautiful Contact into helping as well. Together, they succeed in breaking into the military compound where Eris has been given to the DIA, only to find that she has already broken herself out.\nThe episode ends with the rest of the Catian fleet appearing over the city, announcing their existence and their intent to negotiate a treaty with the Japanese government, as a result of Eris submitting a report about grilled beef. \nSource: Wikipedia",
