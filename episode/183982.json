  "description" : "Vignette: a demon who gets up the first time her alarm clock goes off, puts out her trash early in the morning, keeps her apartment squeaky clean, and goes to bed on time. Gabriel: an angel who won`t wake up until past noon if she can help it, plays MMO holiday quests while dining on instant cup noodles, and games until she passes out at her laptop. These two friends seem to have little in common... until you take a peek inside their bankbooks.\nSource: crunchyroll",
