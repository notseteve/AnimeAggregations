  "description" : "Taiki and his companions arrive in Vampire Land, a dark, eerie Kingdom ruled by the Death General NeoVamdemon. There they encounter Lopmon, who tells them that NeoVamdemon`s minions have been capturing other Lopmon when they Digivolve from Chocomon. Taiki`s team sets off for NeoVamdemon`s castle to free all the Lopmon, but they struggle through battles with immortal enemies and eventually Taiki`s Xros Loader is stolen. Then NeoVamdemon powers up by absorbing his own minions - and then he absorbs MetalGreymon as well! Can Taiki and his teammates overcome this crisis?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
