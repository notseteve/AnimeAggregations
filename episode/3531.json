  "description" : "We found out that making a handmade teddy bear and giving it to the person you like makes them liek you back, so Sakura decided to make one. We went to the craft store with Eriol and Xiaolang to get some supplies. Sakura told me that she sensed Clow Reed while she was makign her teddy bear at home that night, so she met Xiaolang to hunt down the source. But when they met up, Xiaolang started trying to attack Sakura! Luckily, Xiaolang helped Sakura figure out that he was being controlled by some mysterious threads so she could save him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
