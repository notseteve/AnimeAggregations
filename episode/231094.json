  "description" : "In my dream, I saw room 404 of the Greenwood Hotel engulfed in flames, and lying collapsed in the middle of it, Haku. My unease sends me to the hotel I`d seen in my dream, but when I arrive, I`m told they have no room 404. Unable to erase the fear from my heart, I head up to the fourth floor to investigate and I find something that shouldn`t exist - room 404.\nSource: crunchyroll",
