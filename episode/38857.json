  "description" : "When a weird newspaper girl appears in front of Yamato’s room, offering two tickets to the amusement park with a subscription to the newspaper, Yamato thinks that the free day they have coming up is the best time to ask Suzuka out. Unfortunately, Megumi and Yuuka go into his room to goof off, and his tickets end up getting shredded by his cat. When all hope is lost, Suzuka “humbly” asks him out, using tickets that she got from the same newspaper girl. Using such a perfect chance, will Yamato confess his feelings?\nSource: theTVDB.com",
