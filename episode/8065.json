  "description" : "Waking up from a dreadful nightmare of destruction and pain was terrible for Koji and Koichi but more than that, Koichi realized that Cherubimon used him for his own purposes. He felt guilty for hurting his brother and friends. It took a lot of persuasion from Takuya, his friends and Patamon to convince both Koji and Koichi to forgive each other. En route to the Rose Morning Star, Patamon told Koichi that Light and Darkness are brothers and exists for each other and that Darkness does not have to be evil. Unfortunately, Cherubimon stopped the Digi-Destined dead in their tracks and began another attack.\nSource: crunchyroll",
