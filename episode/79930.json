  "description" : "Ninja Zenzo Hattori runs through the city at night. His job requires him to be on time and fulfill his clients` requests perfectly. The job: pizza delivery. One night, as Zenzo is about to land, Gintoki crashes his scooter into Zenzo`s backside. Ignoring the pain of his hemorrhoids, Zenzo grabs the pizza box to make his delivery. But instead of the pizza box, Zenzo accidentally grabs Gintoki`s Jump. Zenzo`s client, Okuni, takes the Jump and tells Zenzo that misfortune will befall his rear and that he should be careful.\nSource: crunchyroll",
