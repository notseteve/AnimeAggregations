  "description" : "Tanikuchi is in the hospital after being injured by the stalkers, and is concerned that Anna has never visited him even once since the incident. After his release, he learns that Anna has made the school crackdowns on indecency even more severe, and that he appears to have suddenly become the target of another stalker himself.\nAyame continues her terrorist plots and learns of a stash of true hardcore pornography that somehow escaped the purges, and she plots to have the students discover it but Sophia Nishikinomiya has arranged an event promulgating even harsher measures on the same day. Ayame has also convinced Otome to join their cause as an erotic artist, but she has an artistic block and needs to see such indecency live in order to draw it.\nTo get the latter to happen she has Tanikuchi invite his stalker in while Otome watches in an adjoining room. The stalker turns out to be none other than Anna, who, being excessively repressed and ignorant of the nature of her sexual urges strips naked and tears off his clothes, and very nearly has intercourse with him right there and then, but Ayame suddenly arrives and she runs off.",
