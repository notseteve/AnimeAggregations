  "description" : "Hime is transferred into Megumi`s school under the Japanese name Hime Shirayuki, becoming excited at the thought of making `one hundred friends`. Upon arriving at school however, she is overcome with fear and finds herself unable to face anyone properly. Megumi tries to get Hime to make friends with Yuko, but she becomes too afraid and turns away from her. Whilst lamenting her actions alone in the gym storage, Hime meets a teacher having his own worries about his students not listening to him. Just then, Namakeruda appears and uses the teacher to create a Cone Saiark. Hime initially struggles against the Saiark, but becomes strengthened by her desire to protect the school and make some friends, defeating the Saiark with help from her new form, Sherbert Ballet. Afterwards, Hime gives the teacher some words of encouragement before working up the courage to become friends with Yuko.\nNote: Cure Moonlight celebrates the 10th anniversary.",
