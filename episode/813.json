  "description" : "The Silver Rhythm Gang break into a city bank. Using Musica`s help, they manage to get inside the safe. They are unable to find a silver object, known as the Silver Ray, among the gold bars and dollars, much to their chagrin. Hebi, second-in-command of the Silver Rhythm Gang, finds Plue in his bag, which results in setting off the alarm. Hebi and Plue are in custody, and Musica turns himself in, having a plan to break out. They manage to escape, but the police are out to search for them. It is revealed that Garein is Musica`s grandfather. To prove that, Garein shows the Musica family tattoo on his right arm. But Musica doesn`t have the tattoo on the same arm, as it is revealed later on that he has it on his left arm. Garein informs Haru and Elie that there is a Rave Stone that was located in the north.\nSource: wiki",
