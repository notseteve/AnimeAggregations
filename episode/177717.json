  "description" : "On a hot summer day, Ohta and Tanaka go to the public pool. Ohta wants to swim, while Tanaka simply wants to cool down in the pool because he can`t swim. Tanaka, who usually doesn`t move, gets a cramp during his stretch. Under Ohta`s supervision, Tanaka enjoys the pool with his water tube. However, two little kids pick on Tanaka and his water tube rips.\nFew days later, Miyano comes to ask Tanaka`s advice about wanting to wear a yukata for the upcoming firework show. Along with Shiraishi, the group decides to go to the kimono store.\nSource: crunchyroll",
