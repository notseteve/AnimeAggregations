  "description" : "Hordes of stray cats are being caught and brought to the Planet Catnip Embassy. As the Gut Rat Gang watches over the caged cats, the king of Planet Catnip makes his appearance. But there is no news of the king coming to Edo, meaning this is a secret visit. The king reveals his reason for capturing the strays, which turns out to be utterly ridiculous. Mixed up in the king’s plot, the strays find themselves in danger when a battered Hoichi comes to their rescue!\nSource: crunchyroll",
