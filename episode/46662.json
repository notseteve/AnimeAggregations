  "description" : "Earl Dracula is craving for blood. He has not had the fresh blood of beautiful women for days. He will die of starvation. When he finally finds a beautiful woman, he sneaks into her bedroom. He is about to bite her neck when he discovers that she has had dinner garnished with plenty of garlic. Finding it more than he can bear, he runs away only to faint from hunger. Then comes an ambulance with a red-cross mark! The environment in this country is way too much for Dracula to live in.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
