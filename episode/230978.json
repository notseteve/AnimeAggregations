  "description" : "Glenn and Sapphee head to the harpy village to examine the harpies. As Tisalia leads their carriage up the mountains, there’s a sudden earthquake and landslide and Kay sprains her ankle. Glenn examines the harpies and notices Lorna acting strange. Tisalia, who also noticed something wrong with Lorna, barges in on Glenn and Sapphee during dinnertime to discuss the matter. She tells them that Lorna is usually rather responsible and reliable, but her head has been in the clouds lately. Glenn decides to check on Lorna because of Tisalia’s request.\nSource: crunchyroll",
