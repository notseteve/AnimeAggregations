  "description" : "A meteorite falls crashes into the South Pole. While researching the site, Dr. Hanamaru, Akira, and the party discover that destruction has occurred in the South Pole base and that the observation site staff have disappeared. Dr. Hanamaru and Nina, who had begun investigating the incidents, are kidnapped and spirited away to the secret base of Dr. Black Jaguar. Akira loses his thinking power and collapses after being exposed to a beam. It becomes clear later that the meteorite is a flying saucer from the planet Barius, and the scientist on the disc is forced to develop ultra photon energy because his daughter has been taken hostage by Black Jaguar. Rescued by the scientist from the planet Barius, Akira turns into Big X, and takes on the giant robot manipulated by Black Jaguar.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
