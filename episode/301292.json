Ecclesia falls into despair upon learning she has been exiled from her homeland. Alongside her is a young dragon boy with no memory of his past, rescued from the battlefield. \"Shuraig\", the leader of Tri-Brigade, urges the two without a place to return to, to leave the front lines and seek refuge with their allies, the \"Springans\".\nThe boy and girl begin to form a bond as they journey through unfamiliar lands, tossed around by fate.\nUnder the starlit sky, touched by the kindness in their exchanged words, the girl gifts a name to the nameless boy.\nSource: Official English Website",
