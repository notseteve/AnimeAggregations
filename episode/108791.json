  "description" : "Lucy settles into her new apartment. Unbeknown to her, Natsu and Happy enter the apartment and Lucy scolds them. She teaches the two how a wizard makes contracts with celestial spirits. Lucy summons Nicola, forms a contract with him and names him Plue. She accepts a job to steal a book entitled Daybreak from the Everlue Mansion`s corrupt owner Duke Everlue. At Fairy Tail, Makarov reviews that job has been changed to destroying the book and increased the reward. They arrive at Shirotsume and accept the request to burn the book. When Everlue rejects Lucy as a maid and insults her, the three infiltrate the mansion and successfully steal the book. However, Everlue, his maids, and his gorilla-sized celestial spirit Virgo, attacks the three. Lucy flees to the sewers, and discovers the book`s hidden secrets before being caught by Everlue. Meanwhile, Natsu takes on Everlue`s mercenaries, the Vanish Brothers, and defeats them along with Virgo.",
