  "description" : "The heroines have spent their last gold coin, but the Paladin realises that there is a `Hero Special Supply Law`, that in theory allows such heroines as them to take whatever they need from the townspeople. Thinking themselves protected by that law, they take whatever they can get from various chests, jars, and drawers they find in the town, seemingly ignored by their owners. Having thereby enriched themselves they stay in an expensive hotel, where the infuriated townspeople take everything back from them, finally tossing them out into the wilderness completely naked.",
