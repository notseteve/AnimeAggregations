  "description" : "The entire group reunites and is attacked by Leomon. After Leomon is defeated with the light of the Digivices, he tells the children about the prophecies of the \"DigiDestined.\" The group goes back to Infinity Mountain for the final showdown with Devimon. There, Devimon absorbs many Black Gears and grows in size and power—turning the fight in his favor until Patamon digivolves into Angemon and destroys him. Angemon, having used up so much power, reverts into a Digi-egg.\nSource: crunchyroll",
