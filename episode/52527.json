  "description" : "Laura and her class are studying the star constellations at school, and have a field trip planned to study the Milky Way under the real night sky! So Laura and Kana are all excited because they will have plenty of stars to wish on. Kana says jokingly to Laura that if you wish on a star at the same time as someone else, the two of you will fall in love! Laura, half believing, sets her mind on standing by Travis when her class goes to see the stars so that they can make a wish on a star together. However, Hamtaro thinks that she`ll be leaving on a star to make her wish. He and the Ham-Hams decide to stop Laura from making her wish. In the end, Laura forgets all about her wish, when she starts having fun focusing on the fireflies. \nSource: Wikipedia",
