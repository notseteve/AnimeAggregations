  "description" : "Gokudera and Ryohei are separated from Yamamoto and Lal Mirch by Irie. They are blocked off by a wall and Yamamoto and Lal cannot save them. Gokudera is confused and irritated, but the door behind them soon opens automatically. Gokudera and Ryohei look at each other and wonder if it`s a trap. Gokudera sends his box weapon Uri to go and scout things out, but Uri doesn`t listen to him at all. Having no choice, the two of them cautiously walk out. They hear a creepy laugh from down the passage way. Waiting for them is another of the Millefiore`s assassins--!\nSource: crunchyroll",
