  "description" : "The gig is a success but the invisible battle in the sky causes broken windows all around the place, leaving the police confused. When the band decides to make a demo tape, Misato approaches them and invites them to record it at the CosmoPop studio during the next 48 hours. At this location Kyouta meets his idol Ryuusei, the most popular vocalist of the country, only to be disappointed by this man`s stuck-up attitude. Yoriko has a stunning vision of her imminent awakening, and Rumiko urges her to make the right decision.",
