  "description" : "Haru and Shuuda continue their battle, while Musica fights against Poosya and Rugar alone. Rugar uses his Delta Cannon and Poosya uses his Glue Tear in combination, putting Musica on edge. Elie wakes up to distract Poosya and Rugar, enabling Musica to defeat them both. Haru figures out that Shuda cannot use the Explosive Flame Ballet at close range, since it explodes at the area around the target. However, Shuuda uses the Explosive Flame Ballet regardless, causing a massive explosion. Meanwhile, Elie, Musica, Plue, and Griff finds an underground base, where Poosya and Rugar were hiding. Rugar sets the underground base to self-destruct. Later on, as both Haru and Shuda are weakened, Haru defeats Shuuda, using all the strength he can muster. As Shuuda admits defeat, his launches himself from the floating platform, by using the Explosive Flame Ballet to explode his arm.",
