  "description" : "Ritsuka hears a rumor that the person that Mafuyu used to date had died and is a bit shaken. Ritsuka couldn’t build up the courage to ask Mafuyu about it, but then, Akihiko visits his place. Akihiko then suggests that Mafuyu write the lyrics for the song Ritsuka had made. Ritsuka was thinking the same thing, and at the next band practice, asks Mafuyu if he’d do it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
