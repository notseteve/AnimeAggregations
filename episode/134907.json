  "description" : "A great number of Digimon called Zenimon appear in the shopping district, hanging out near cash registers and messing up the machines. Tagiru tries to hunt a Zenimon, but his target is snatched from him by a boy named Hideaki Mashimo. Tagiru and company make an agreement with Hideaki, who is only involved in the Digimon Hunt to make money and has no interest in Digimon at all, to capture Digimon together. As this goes on, Tagiru encounters a Digimon called Ganemon! They learn that the Zenimon are Ganemon`s underlings, but something happened and they all escaped. Ganemon asks them to help him recapture the Zenimon, so Tagiru and the others team up with him! However, soon enough something changes in Ganemon, sending the shopping district into a panic?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
