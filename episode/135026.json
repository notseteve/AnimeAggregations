  "description" : "Elena enlists the help of Kaito and his friends as extras in a new sentai show she is starring in. Later that night, Elena brings everyone together for a Kenja Puzzle in which they must construct a three-dimensional puzzle within a time limit or else be electrocuted. As Elena makes the puzzle harder by throwing in a remote controlled UFO in the works, the POG president sends in more explosive variants against Elena`s wish. After everyone works together to stop the bombs and protect Elena, Kaito enters his Orpheus state and solves the puzzle in the last minute, revealing the treasure to be a puzzle book Elena had when she was younger. Meanwhile, the HQ President is relieved of his duty for his unfair ways.\nSource: Wikipedia",
