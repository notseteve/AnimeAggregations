  "description" : "Tenma and the others hear that the immortal Specters can be destroyed using berries from the Goldenrain tree that grows in the Underworld, so they quickly search for it. They reach the tree, when the Gemini Golden Saint Asmita appears. Is he friend, or foe? Asmita has been studying meditation in his own world, void of light, and so criticizes Tenma’s fighting ability, releasing the “Tenmaihourin” – which takes away a person’s five senses.\nSource: crunchyroll",
