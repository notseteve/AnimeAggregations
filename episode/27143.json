  "description" : "It’s a multi-pronged attack as Dartz adds a third ring to Seal of Orichalcos, stopping the Pharaoh and Kaiba from doing... anything!  Even when they manage to attack, Dartz’s Orichalcos Kyutora absorbs all damage!  Furthermore, to add insult to injury, Dartz summons the thundering Orichalcos Shunoros to pound the Pharaoh and Kaiba into pancakes! It’s game over, for even the guardian dragons are little match against this battling behemoth!\nSource: crunchyroll",
