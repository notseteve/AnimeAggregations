  "description" : "The current quest is to make Jiffon Island`s harvest festival a success, but the festival can`t be held because some orcs that strayed onto the island have taken over all of the Buffo that are traditionally offered as sacrifices. On top of that, the increasing number of orcs threatens the islanders` very lives. With the festival date only 11 days away, Yotsuya begins leveling up to raise his rank so he can help fight them, and his job changes to Blacksmith.\nSource: crunchyroll",
