  "description" : "Alice has created a new challenge for herself: when she walks home from school, she can only step on shadows.  This is an ironclad law for her - but try as she might, she keeps failing.  Even worse, Athena interferes by trying to help out.  Alice`s self-imposed challenge is something that she must conquer alone, or so she thinks; but maybe there`s more to success than just doing everything by yourself.\nSource: crunchyroll",
