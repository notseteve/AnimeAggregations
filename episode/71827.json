  "description" : "The Keroro Platoon has one day to send a report to HQ that details all of their invasion efforts since arriving on Pekopon, so they start crafting a heroic narrative on DVD by editing in bits and pieces of video footage from their misadventures. Later, Chief Nurse Pururu wants to know what the platoon has really been up to all this time, so Keroro gives her and the other members a peek into the memories of a reluctant Giroro... but Kululu and Keroro quickly get sidetracked with the amusing prank of editing Giroro`s memories.\nSource: crunchyroll",
