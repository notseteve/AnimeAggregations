  "description" : "Itou attempts to make the Supernatural Research Club into a real club of sorts, requesting funding from the student council. The student council president Yamazaki is unimpressed by Yamada`s threats, nor charmed by him when he comes to see him in Shiraishi`s body. Inexplicably, however, he sees through the ruse, realising he is still talking to Yamada, but offers them a deal to provide the club with funding. He tells them how Shiraishi, despite her excellent performance in school, refuses to enter college after graduating. He wants to know why and to convince her to do so, as it would be a disgrace for the school for their best student not to go on to higher education.\nOne day, Yamada swaps bodies with Shiraishi while she is very sick, giving him a chance to see her house and find out why she refuses to go to college. He realises she is a sad and lonely girl. He manages to convince her to go to college after graduating after he says he plans to go himself as well.",
