  "description" : "Ibarada suggests that one of the greatest factors in the base conditions of romantic love is \"whether or not you want to kiss the person,\" so Yukimura decides to try to kiss Himuro. However, Himuro doesn`t like the idea of a kiss where the exact angle is measured with a protractor.  When Himuro realizes that if the mood were more like it had been in the Ferris wheel, she might not mind a kiss, she and Yukimura create an equation to numerically define \"mood value.\" In what location might the \"mood value\" be highest? And will the two of them be able to kiss...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
