  "description" : "After getting completely rejected, Yamato ends up going through depression, and is cured by the unlikely Yuuka, after revealing her past and her former “normal” self. Yamato decides that he definitely likes Suzuka, and will not give up after being rejected once. He decides to join the track team, and seeks Yasunobu’s advice. Unfortunately, Suzuka overhears their conversation, and does not think that Yamato will try hard in track, and will slow them down instead. After she leaves, Yasunobu suggests that he apologize, and that Yamato was a slacker his whole life, so being in the track team was not plausible. When Yamato goes into the track office to apologize, he ends up signing up for the track team.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
