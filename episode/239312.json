  "description" : "“I humbly accept. I look forward to a long-lasting relationship.” Using a termination program given to them by Dr. Saeki, Vivy and Matsumoto use it to shut down the activity of Metal Float. However, this causes the AI that governs the island to go completely out of control, and it engages in battle with Toak when they try to attack the island. With “AIs attacking humans” now a fait accompli, Vivi rescues the members of Toak, and heads to the center of the island to prevent further havoc by the AI.\nSource: Funimation",
