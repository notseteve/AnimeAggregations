  "description" : "Izumi-kun is out sick from school. Shikimori-san learns that Izumi-kun asked Inuzuka to take notes for him, causing her to glare daggers at Inuzuka in envy. Yes, Shikimori-san sees Inuzuka as a rival. When the two of them go to Izumi-kun`s house together to take the notes to him, Hachimitsu secretly follows them, and one little word that slips from Shikimori-san`s mouth leads her to deduce the reason for this perceived rivalry... On another day, Shikimori-san is at the mall with Nekozaki, where they run into Kamiya-san and invite her to hang out with them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
