  "description" : "In town, there have been a series of incidents where young women have had all the blood drained from their body while they are still alive. Kitaro can`t believe it could possibly be another vampire, and if it is, he wonders why vampires keep appearing. Then he learns from the witch Agnes, a European youkai, that Backbeard made use of lifeblood and there are signs of his resurrection. That`s why all the blood-draining youkai are trying to gather blood. She also hints that a vampire even stronger than Vampire Elite, la Seine, might have come to Japan. Kitaro is convinced that he is the one behind the recent incidents and goes to investigate. Who is this vampire la Seine?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
