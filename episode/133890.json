As this goes on, incidents of rampant test attacks begin to occur! Sensing that a Digimon might be involved, Tagiru sets out on a Digimon Hunt with Gumdramon. They then discover that Musashi is behind the test attacks. Musashi insists that he was fighting fair and square, that they were proper duels and not test attacks, but in the next moment he`s surrounded by a black aura...! Is it Kotemon`s doing, or is another Digimon behind this...?! Tagiru and company take a stand to find the truth behind Musashi`s black aura!\nSource: crunchyroll",
