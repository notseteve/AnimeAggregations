  "description" : "T.L.System step up preparations for their debut gig. Yoriko lives out her powers on fellow actor Morita. Asumi attacks Abuto`s car with an ice hail but this time Saraswati doesn`t just play with her. As a result, Kyouta`s performance gets so bad that Ryuusei complains about the waste of studio effort; Kyouta takes this to heart and takes the appropriate action. The boy then runs into Kiriko who is signing autographs for her fans; with her new self-esteem she straightens her idol out.",
