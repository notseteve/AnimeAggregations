  "description" : "Air Master vs. Sky Star, the mid-air battle extravaganza has finally begun! But Kai is a cut above Maki when it comes to the ring. Maki is about to collapse! But then, Sakiyama yells from ringside, \"What the hell are you doing in there?!\" But then Maki is smacked! Mio, Kai and the spectators are all stunned. Sakiyama is screaming to kick Kai and Mio`s butts! Sakiyama goes to unleash her Hua Jing on Kai but it misfires. Then Kai and Mio explode in a magnificent combination attack! Sakiyama and Maki are knocked into their corner. Kai hits with her Missile Kick and Mio unleashes her special attack, the Izakaya Bomber, on the back of Maki`s head. Mio and Kai sandwich her with an Izakaya Bomber. Mio taunts Maki, saying this is what pro wrestling is really like, but Sakiyama smirks back saying this is perfect for her. Hearing that, Kai decides to unleash an attack that employs her true spirit as a pro wrestler. The match is approaching its climax!\nSource: crunchyroll",
