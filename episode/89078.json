  "description" : "As a member of the school morals committee, Kuryuu Megumi greets all of the students at the school entrance gate every morning to ensure their appearance complies with the school rules. When she complains to Hiiragi about other students not following these rules he explains that they are dressing up for a chance at a high school romance. Romantically clueless Megumi just can`t understand how Hiiragi could give such an answer but starts to wonder what kind of boy she might be interested in.",
