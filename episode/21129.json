  "description" : "Tokino Kageyuki is almost within reach of becoming a leader of warriors thanks to his pet horse Midoro`s good work, but he is conceited enough to believe that the credit all goes to him. Then he blames Midoro`s pony for causing Midoro to be slow by following her around. He takes the pony away from her and sells it off. It turns out that Dororo and Hyakkimaru buy the pony. Losing her child breaks Midoro`s heart. Then Midoro becomes a ferocious horse and gets possessed by a demon, setting the city aflame and killing Kageyuki. Although she has become a monster, she understands her pony`s love for her. Nevertheless, Hyakkimaru defeats the monster-horse Midoro with his sword.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
