  "description" : "The course of warfare has been altered by the invention of massive weapons platforms known as `Objects`, which have essentially rendered all conventional and even nuclear weapons obsolete. Warfare has become a cleaner affair and decided completely by Objects and their pilots.\nHavia Winchell, a soldier-in-training and Quenthur Barbotage, a student studying to become an Object mechanic, are assigned to a military base in Alaska where an Object known as the Baby Magnum operates from. Sick of the terrible military rations, they go hunting, and Quenthur meets the Baby Magnum`s pilot, Miinda Brantini, whom he calls the `Princess`. She shares her misgivings with him, that she is piloting a first-generation general-purpose Object that is probably outclassed by the newer Objects that have been developed recently.\nHavia and Quenthur watch in horror as the Baby Magnum is destroyed in an engagement with another Object.",
