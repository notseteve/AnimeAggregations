  "description" : "Nana is shocked to see Mea with all her weapons out, believing that she was just an ordinary girl, and is crushed when Mea tells her that their friendship has always been just an act. Rito visits her in the virtual space where the alien animals she summons dwell, and he consoles her, embracing her and telling her about his experience of Mea`s feelings of uncertainty and loneliness, and that even if she was faking everything and lying to her about her true nature before, now that she knows the truth, that is only an opportunity to become closer to her.\nNana then seeks Mea out, using one of the animals Mea played with before to sniff out where she was. Mea attacks her, but she comes forward unafraid, as Mea cannot seem to make her weapons hit. Eventually Mea pulls Nana into her Trans world, here Nana manages to break through to her.\nLater, Mea is visited by Nemesis, who says that she can do as she pleases for now, as it is helping her to understand what led Yami astray.",
