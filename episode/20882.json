  "description" : "The weather is beautiful on New Year`s and for the occasion, many people in Laura`s town have taken to flying kites. As we might expect, the Ham-Hams want a part in the fun, too! So Panda teaches each of the other Ham-Hams how to make their own kites! But when the Ham-Hams go out to fly them, Boss gets jealous that Hamtaro`s kite is flying next to Bijou`s. \nSource: Wikipedia",
