  "description" : "A large number of displaced yokai have arrived in GeGeGe Forest. Starting with Miminaga, Kitaro and the others welcome them all into the forest. After receiving a bag of jewels, Ratman is very pleased. One day, one of the jewels bursts with light and a young witch, a girl of wind, appears. When Kitaro tries to ask who the girl is, a man suddenly appears from another direction. When Miminaga and the others see the man, they tremble in fear. The man is from the gang that destroyed their country. Miminaga and the others throw themselves at him, but they are all cruelly slaughtered. Enraged, Kitaro and the others challenge the man, but they fall one by one!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
