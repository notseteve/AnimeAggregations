  "description" : "God orders Abraham to sacrifice his son to God. Abraham is terrified to do such thing, but he cannot disobey the God. He decides to be faithful to God even if he has to sacrifice his son`s life. When he is just about to swing his sword down on Isaac`s chest, God`s messenger says, \"Don`t kill him. You have proven your awe to God.\" God praises Abraham as the father of all humans for his willingness to offer his son.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
