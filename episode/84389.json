  "description" : "Gola Moska has gone out of control. Tsuna splits him in two. It looks as if things have come to an end, but Tsuna and Reborn are at a loss for words when Xanxus’ plan is revealed. The cruel reality and the trap set almost wipes out the warmth that existed. But Tsuna tells Xanxus, “I won`t let you succeed Vongola IX!” Tsuna`s determination and Xanxus’ anger clash. The Cervello take charge and make the Sky Ring battle, the final battle in the fight for the Vongola Rings.\nSource: crunchyroll",
