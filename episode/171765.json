  "description" : "Lupin has been arrested and imprisoned. He`s tried everything he could to escape, but Zenigata stops him every time. Zenigata then sends Lupin to an even higher-security prison, just to be on the safe side. Lupin finally accepts his fate and won`t even touch the food Zenigata offers him anymore, which leaves him weak and frail. The end of Lupin III has come at last.\nSource: crunchyroll",
