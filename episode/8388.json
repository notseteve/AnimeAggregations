  "description" : "The Digidestined meet up with Ophanimon, who is currently trapped in a cage of light and facing off against Cherubimon. After Agunimon, Lobomon, Kumamon, Kazemon, Beetlemon, and Loweemon try their attacks in vein, they soon learn that their powers are weakened. Agunimon and Lobomon go back to Takuya and Koji, then fusion-evolve, grabbing Cherubimon and carrying him outside where they can have a final confrontation. Meanwhile, the other four legendary warriors set to work on freeing Ophanimon and decide to break the mirrors that are refracting the light from his cage. However, Aldamon and BeoWolfmon are no match for Cherubimon as he absorbs their D-tectors. As Takuya and Koji are barely hanging on, Cherubimon bursts back into the castle and attacks the warriors.\nSource: crunchyroll",
