  "description" : "In the first of two stories, Aika is stuck in bed after catching a cold.  She wonders about Akari and Alice...  Are they slacking off without her?  Surely they`re lost without her guidance!  So she sneaks out of bed one day to go take a peek...  And in the second story, Aika has a cute new set of hairpins, and she`d like to show them to Al.  But she can`t find the chance to visit him, and it`s bothering her more than it should.  Why does her heart ache when she thinks about it?\nSource: crunchyroll",
