  "description" : "The Ring of Arcana has appeared. Knowing that its manifestation means the European yokai will be coming again, Kitaro, Agnes, and the others search desperately for the ring. But it`s Mana who finds the ring, just by chance. Not knowing it`s the Ring of Arcana, she puts it on her finger. When she realizes she can`t take it off, she panics. Kitaro clashes with Adele so that Mana can get away. As Mana tries to escape, she`s attacked by Wolfgang, then Victor, then Camilla, and Child`s-cry Old Man, the Plastered Wall, and Cat-girl step in to cover her. The struggle for the ring intensifies and sweeps Mana up in its wake!\nSource: crunchyroll",
