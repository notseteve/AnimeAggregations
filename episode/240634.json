  "description" : "A close-range fight forces Cestvs up against the wall. Not only does he have nowhere to run, but Cestvs unfortunately injured his ankle when Felix`s powerful blows forced him to the ground. \"If I can`t retreat, then I`ll counterattack here!\" His efforts appear ineffective as he barely evades Felix`s tempestuous blows, waiting for an opportunity to strike back. \"No matter how big my disadvantage, as long as there`s something I can do, I won`t give up!\" Just then, Felix`s attacks begin to change, and Cestvs finds his golden opportunity.\nSource: crunchyroll",
