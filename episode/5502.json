  "description" : "A bank robbery takes place in Neo Tokyo. To avoid being captured by the police, the thieves raid a local school and take hostages. The police are trying to handle the situation when a businessman arrives and sends in a robot police squad. They quickly subdue the criminals using non-lethal force. Over the next few days, the robotic police show their many other skills, including the ability to interrogate captives, rescue kittens from trees and run really, really fast. The human police force now faces new competition, humanoid robots serving as policemen! Nanvel and the rest of Team Warrior have their suspicions. The robots seem to be too advanced to be real.\nSource: Wiki",
