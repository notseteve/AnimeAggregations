  "description" : "Agnes and Leicester are planning something secretly, and later they propose that the clan take on a quest to recover some rainbow flowers that absorb all the light surrounding them. They grow in a certain forest which is growing darker and more dangerous as they flourish. Carina accepts, and they travel to that forest, and Carina and Leicester use her staff Montecchia to survey the area and tell the rest of the clan where to go. Their aerial survey discovers the spot where the flowers grow, and they direct everyone else where it is, while the two of them investigate ahead. As Carina tries to reach for one of the flowers they are attacked by a crystal monster, and she uses her staff to fly to a safe distance so she can use her magic on it while Leicester tries to fend it off, but she suddenly loses magical energy and falls on top of him, and the two of them are tangled in vines in a compromising position when the rest of the clan arrives and defeats the monster, recovering its crystal.\nThey return to town with the flowers, and Agnes and Leicester say that they wanted to go on the quest so they could obtain a crystal powerful enough for them to modify Montecchia so it can talk. After some false starts Leicester eventually succeeds with Carina`s help.",
