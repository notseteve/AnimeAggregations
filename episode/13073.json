  "description" : "Rosette and Chrono are sent to retrieve Azmaria Hendric, an apostle of charity, from Ricardo Hendric, the casino resort hotel manager and her foster father. Rosette reluctantly bumps into Azmaria in an equipment room, but she is caught by Lerajie, Ricardo`s servant. As the two catch up with Chrono, the three escape outside but are attacked by the demon army under Lerajie`s command. Several hotel guests suffered from injuries after Rosette and Chrono defeated the army. However, Azamaria responsively vocalizes, having the angelic powers to heal the wounded. Back at the convent, Sister Kate and Father Remington inform Rosette that Joshua, being her younger brother, is an apostle of hope, though harnessing demonic powers. Rosette later takes Chrono and Azmaria to a nearby lake, in hope of cheering up the latter. After sunset, Lerajie, revealed to be a viscount under Aion, ambushes the area and captures Azmaria. \nSource: Wikipedia",
