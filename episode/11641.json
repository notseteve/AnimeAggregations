  "description" : "Rei and another Fairy Air Force crewmember investigate a Banshee flying aircraft carrier that opened fire on friendly forces prior. Further inspection on the seemingly-deserted carrier reveals that it is being used by JAM to create human clones. When transmission of their finding triggers the FAF`s computerized command and control system into launching a SRBM to destroy the Banshee, Rei escapes, but his companion, upon discovery that he himself is a JAM clone, elects to stay behind onboard the doomed air fortress.",
