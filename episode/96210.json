  "description" : "Karasuma Yoichi has lived all his life in the wilderness with his father, who has been training him in the ways of the samurai, living his life pretty much as in feudal Japan, with no intrusions from the modern world. After he manages to best his father one last time he is told to go out into the city and learn what he can there. The father sends a message to their distant relatives the Ikarugas who run a dojo in the city, and Yoichi is told to meet with them.\nThe modern world is baffling to the young samurai, who quickly gets into trouble as he goes through a shopping mall trying to find the Ikarugas. He beats up an arrogant punk who mocks his anachronistic appearance and chases down a thief, causing no small disturbance in the process. While doing this he runs into two of the Ikaruga sisters under somewhat compromising circumstances, but helps lost Kagome find Ibuki. He is arrested by the police but later released after apologising to everyone inconvenienced, as he is seen to be good-hearted. After Ibuki brings him home, the other Ikaruga sisters are surprised to see him.",
