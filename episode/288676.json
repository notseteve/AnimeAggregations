  "description" : "NPCs barricade themselves in a castle and easily wipe out MMTM and SHINC with power beyond anybody`s imagination. ZEMAL subsequently tries to enter the castle with a sign that says, \"We’re not your enemy; let us into the castle!\" They fail as Pitohui sabotages them. LPFM`s drone, considered the jewel in their operations, gets shot down by NPC attacks. Pitohui suggests everyone from the other teams cooperate in a coordinated attack. They attack the castle with T-S, ZEMAL, MMTM, and SHINC!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
