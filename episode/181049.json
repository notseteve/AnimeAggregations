  "description" : "The Buranki Epimew soars over hills and plains, faster and lighter than the wind, disappearing from sight in an instant only to rise high into the sky again. In the cockpit, Laetitia is delighted by the sight of whooper swans flying by. Since she lives her life in a wheelchair, the world as seen from the birds` point of view is wondrous to her. Epimew flies past the birds and shoots high above the clouds, higher and higher. What`s going through Laetitia`s mind as she finally reaches the heights of space?\nSource: crunchyroll",
