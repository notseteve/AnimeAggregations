  "description" : "Four months have passed since the trial. Berry is now a ghost herself, and has joined the detective club alongside Hack and her friends. They`re trying to capture Phantom Zero, and discover the truth behind the Zero Phenomenon. And that`s when a certain client approaches them. This man wants them to find his missing daughter. But after a bit of digging, it turns out the missing girl isn`t his daughter, but the female avatar that he had been using. Not only that, but the timing of the disappearance seems to have something to do with when Berry and Hack were caught in a Zero Phenomenon incident.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
