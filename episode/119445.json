  "description" : "The clan is going on another quest from an old woman who is one of Agnes`s most avid fans. They are to obtain a supply of hot spring crystals and go to an abandoned mine to obtain some. While mining these crystals they happen upon a hidden chamber with a large crystal in its centre, which has a complex flow of Ale energy emanating from it. Before they can examine it further the mine experiences subsidence due to the rains, and the ceiling cracks, and they try to get out, but Agnes and Leicester are separated from the others by a cave-in. The two of them manage to find another way out, and see a rainbow at the exit, and rejoin the others.\nWhen they return to the clan house, they use the extra hot spring crystals to heat water for the bath, and Leicester is encouraged by his mother Shelley to go ahead. She has however also told the same thing to Agnes and the two of them bump into each other. They hide in a corner while the other girls get inside, and Leicester manages to get away without them realising he was there.",
