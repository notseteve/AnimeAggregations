  "description" : "The first game of the knockout stages has begun. Their opponents are tournament favorites Urawa Hosei. From the start, though Soshizaki uses her quick wits to create opportunities despite being closely guarded, she finds herself blocked by Urawa Hosei`s impregnable defense. Urawa Hosei gradually forces the Warabis into a corner with their ever-changing formation. Meanwhile, Kirishima recalls last year`s game against Kunogi Academy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
