  "description" : "After colliding with the Gate of Zedan, the asteroid Axis is now falling toward the lunar city of Granada. The Argama travels to Axis, hoping to use the asteroid`s communications facilities to contact the AEUG fleet so that they can deflect it with the captured colony laser. Their efforts are interrupted when Rosamia attacks in a formidable new Psyco Gundam, and Kamille makes one last attempt to reach out to the woman he once knew as Rosammy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
