  "description" : "God tells Abraham \"Sarah`s son Isaac will carry on your family line.\" God also says that Ishmael, who was born between Abraham and another woman, Hagaru, would be the father of a nation because he is also Abraham`s son. This myth became a strong motivation behind the building of Israel, the Jewish homeland.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
