  "description" : "Bucciarati and the others end up facing off with 2 assassins sent by the boss, Cioccolata and Secco. Cioccolata uses his Stand Green Tea against them. His Stand creates a mold that makes living creatures rot away and he unleashed it upon the fishing village that Bucciarati and his crew arrived at. Bucciarati and the others manage to evade the attack for the most part and try to keep heading towards the Colosseum, but then Secco also uses his Stand, Sanctuary.\nSource: crunchyroll",
