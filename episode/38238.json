  "description" : "After the school festival and Christmas passes by, the entire group goes on an outing by going on a water taxi ride along the Sumida River. On there, Mayama reveals to Takemoto he knows about Takemoto`s feelings toward Hagu and tells him to not give up. Their day continues when they arrive at the Kasai Seaside Park, only to find it largely deserted due to the season. They ride the Ferris wheel there, but end up in awkward seating arrangements due to Morita`s antics. On the water taxi ride back, Takemoto ponders about the group`s situation and how the new year will be like.\nSource: Wikipedia",
