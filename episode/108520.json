  "description" : "One day Lag Seeing finds himself shipped. His mother abducted by someone, he`s now just a package sent by her to be delivered to a friend`s house.  Gauche Suede is a Letter Bee, a member of the Amberground national postal service, who is tasked with delivering this \"letter,\" together with his partner Roda.  The still young Lag rebels at Gauche`s seemingly emotionless focus on his work, his heart still reeling from being torn from his mother, but as they head into a valley they are attacked by a ferocious creature known as a Gaichuu.\nSource: crunchyroll",
