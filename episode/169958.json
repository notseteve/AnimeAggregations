  "description" : "There has been a recent rash of underwear theft incidents in the school and Anna has ordered an investigation. These incidents are being blamed on SOX causing the group`s reputation to fall among the students, so Tanukichi and Ayame investigate the matter seriously. They stake out the girls` changing rooms in an attempt to catch the thief, and when Ayame comes closer to investigate, Anna molests Tanukichi again until Gouriki comes by. After recovering Tanukichi comes to check on Ayame and finds she is confronting Hyouka, who is hiding a yaoi manga by Otome starring characters clearly based on himself and Gouriki, which he confiscates and destroys. Meanwhile, Anna and Gouriki have managed to capture a large group of the underwear thieves, who are identified by a projection of their leader as members of a group called Moist Throng, saying that they are inspired by SOX.\nAyame is incensed as this Moist Throng seems to have a far more radical agenda than SOX, and the reputation of their group is suffering by association, so they resolve to stop them somehow. After the meeting Tanukichi runs into a young girl named Onigashira Kosuri who is on the run from the moral police, and he helps her escape, and tells him that she is the daughter of Onigashira Keisuke, the secret financial backer of many naughty terror groups, and that she is trying to join SOX. Ayame, though sceptical and suspicious of her reluctantly allows her to join the group.",
