  "description" : "\"Amane-kun, I want to go shopping with you during Golden week.\" Amane accepts Mahiru`s invitation and the two get dressed up to go out on a secret date. The neighbors talk, hold hands, and fully enjoy their special day out on the town. When stopping for a break, they coincidentally bump into Yuta, who quickly puts two and two together. The next day, Itsuki and Yuta grill their buddy Amane about whether or not he has feelings for Mahiru. Amane starts to feel the pressure from his friends` sharp questions.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
