  "description" : "July buys himself a guitar, which he risks in a game against Chifuyu. Whilst retrieving his bag later that day, July learns that Tomoyo is trying to become a novel author, being surprisingly supportive. Tomoyo feels pleased the next day when she passes the first round of a light novel award, so July invites her to lunch on the weekend to celebrate. As the two spend time together on what many would see as a \"date\", element manipulator Kushikawa Hatoko is shocked to see them together. \nSource: Wikipedia",
