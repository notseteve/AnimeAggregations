  "description" : "Shiro and Dema fight; Kou takes out Dema with Sakasaen. Bekira wants to seal Shiro, so Kou and Bekira fight. Kuu and Tsukuyomi argue about Shiro`s fate. Kuu does not believe sealing Shiro would make Tooru happy, while Tsukuyomi says Tooru would be chased by the Oni for the rest of his life if it did not happen. Tsukuyomi maintains that Shiro must either die or be sealed. Kuu phones Noboru saying that Shiro will die unless Bekira seals her. Tooru and Noboru agree, however Kuu omits to tell them that Shiro`s only real danger was from Tsukuyomi and other like-minded Gods.\nSource: crunchyroll",
