  "description" : "Sakura baked a cake with her father to practice for our home ec class. It turned out so well, we were sure our cake would turn out great, too. But our entire class baked cakes that were too sweet, so we had to try again the next week. During our second attempt, while the class took a break for lunch, Sakura and Xiaolang discovered that the Sweet card had been tampering with the cakes. With the help of salt, Sakura was able to seal the card away, and none of our cakes were too sweet this time!\nSource: crunchyroll",
