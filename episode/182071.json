  "description" : "Hanasaki runs out of the office after an argument with Akechi and the others, only to end up confined by Twenty Faces and shown several video clips: Haruhiko in the hospital after surviving the gunshot, a girl who died when she didn`t receive a needed organ transplant from the facility that the Boy Detectives` Club shut down, Hanasaki`s father at a press conference for the opening of his new commercial complex... and finally, the rest of the Boy Detectives` Club carrying on without him. These videos and Twenty Faces` words cut deeply into Hanasaki`s psyche.\nSource: crunchyroll",
