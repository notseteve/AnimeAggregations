  "description" : "Rokuta agrees with Atsuyu’s purpose and to be taken hostage by him, but disagrees with his demand to establish an emperor position above the king.  Battle will be unavoidable.  Rokuta asks Koya to stop Atsuyu, but Koya owes Atsuyu and also Atsuyu believes in his action, so he cannot stop him.  En-o surprises his officers with his bold plan to deal with the crisis.  Rokuta is a Kirin, a creature of justice and mercy, so he does not like authorities, but Ribi convinces him that Shoryu is doing a great job as a king when officers are not looking.  Ribi tries to kill herself to let Rokuta out of jail and also to show her loyalty to the king.\nSource: crunchyroll",
