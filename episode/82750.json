  "description" : "Ichigo awakens to realize that the serious injuries he received from Grimmjow`s attack have completely healed. He senses that Orihime came to his room from the traces of Spiritual Pressure that she left behind. Hitsugaya comes to get Ichigo, and they head to Orihime`s room. Ichigo senses that something is odd when he sees Rukia and the others gathered there. A transmission comes in from the Soul Society and Captain Ukitake appears on the monitor. He tells them the terrifying truth: that Orihime is with the Arrancars and may already be dead.\nSource: crunchyroll",
