  "description" : "The strange little black bird Nero, who kept following Asta around, suddenly appears before Finral, who had just finished fighting with his brother Langris, and demands that he take them to the Demon’s bones back in Hage Village. Finral is obviously startled that Nero’s suddenly speaking human words but obliges and takes Nero to the bones and witnesses an unbelievable sight. We will finally find out the true events that befell the elves 500 years ago! Meanwhile, back at the Shadow Palace, the devil’s eerie magic fills the room.\nSource: crunchyroll",
