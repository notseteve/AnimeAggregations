  "description" : "Suguha reminisces about how she started VR gaming, and then meets up with Recon`s real life persona, Nagata Shin`ichi. She informs him that she will be leaving their party to join Kirito. Later, she logs in as Leafa and accompanies Kirito to shop for new equipment, but runs into her party. The group is led by Sigurd who does not take kindly to Leafa`s departure and warns them they will be consider renegades for not sticking their allegiance to their race`s territories. Before Kirito and Leafa set off, Recon approaches them, saying that though he wants to join them, he will remain in the party to keep an eye on Sigurd due to some suspicions he has on him. Later during their travels, Kirito and Leafa arrive at a landing point where they take turns logging out to refresh themselves. After Kirito returns, they both set off again, unaware that they are being followed by a mysterious group. Meanwhile, Asuna learns from Oberon that Kirito is still alive and secretly obtains the keycode for her cage`s lock.\nSource: Wiki",
