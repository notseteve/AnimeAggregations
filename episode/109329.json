  "description" : "Sucked of his life essence on a daily basis by Yayoi and Kanako, Sunglass is somewhat groggy. Arashi proposes that only one of them use him as a source of energy supply, so Yayoi tries to find someone compatible with her from today’s customers at Hakobune. Since Yayoi is shy with men, she struggles to respond back to them. With his dog, Yamashiro arrives at the café. Everyone at Hakobune urges Yayoi to go talk to Yamashiro, but, panicking, Yayoi runs away. \nSource: crunchyroll",
