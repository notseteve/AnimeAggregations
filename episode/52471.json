Kariya and Koga are greeted by two of the Seireitei`s finest, Squad 2 Lieutenant Marechiyo Omaeda and Squad 7 Lieutenant Tetsuzaemon Iba.  The Bounts` ability to rapidly gain power by absorbing reishi while in the Soul Society has tipped the scales in their favor considerably. Ichigo and the others are in for a suprise when they find out that the metal doll, Dalk, is stronger than ever and eager to terrorize the men of the Soul Society.\nSource: crunchyroll",
