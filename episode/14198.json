  "description" : "Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria take a trip to the Seventh Bell Orphanage, where Rosette and Joshua had previously resided. The orphanage was destroyed yet frozen in time. Four years ago, a short-tempered Rosette had cared for a sickly Joshua. She tries to convince him not to join the Magdalene Order. The two later slip into a riverbed, where they end up falling into a pit. Joshua uses his powers to heal Rosette of her bloodily wounded knee, but Joshua wonders why his powers cannot heal himself. They find the tomb of Mary Magdalene underground, encountering Chrono for the first time, who introduces himself as a devil. The three go out on a picnic, and Chrono talks about how the astral lines are the souls that encompass the universe, which catches the attention of Joshua. The three later spend the rest of the day together. Come nightfall, Joshua goes to see Father Remington, in hopes of finding a cure for his illness. Meanwhile, Rosette and Chrono are distraught when Aion shows up in the form of an eagle. \nSource: Wikipedia",
