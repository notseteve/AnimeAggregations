  "description" : "When Tora accidentally kicks a piece of wood which hits Nora on the head, the two of them get into a fight that gradually escalates to involve all of their friends of Third Street. Gon proposes making some rules for the scuffle, and the showdown begins to look a lot like soccer...\nThe Third Street park has been completely transformed for the annual Bon dancing. While Tama and the others investigate, Takeshi draws them in his summer vacation observation journal and the drawings make them look like they`re dancing! Here, on a midsummer`s night, is an illusion of everyone dancing to the Tama Ondo!\nSource: crunchyroll",
