  "description" : "Momose and Shirosaki`s next business trip takes them to Shirosaki`s hometown in Akita Prefecture. Shirosaki is triggered by the trauma of being snatched up by a namahage demon as a child during the local festival, but he is able to complete their field research safely. Previously, Shirosaki received a phone call from his grandmother saying, \"I have something I want to show you,\" so the two head to Shirosaki`s family home. At his grandmother`s suggestion, they look at and reminisce over old photo albums when his grandmother reveals that \"what she wants to show\" is something Shirosaki never expected.\nSource: crunchyroll",
