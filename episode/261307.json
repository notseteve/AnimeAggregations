  "description" : "\"I like you a lot too. I respect you. And I believe in your future more than anyone.\"\nThere is another world—a world with twelve island countries that float in the ocean like the petals of a flower. The people of this world, who value grace and refinement, refer to their countries as \"Flowers.\" Once every several years, the different Flowers put warfare aside to compete in a festival of beauty.\nIn the mysterious land of Kikyo, life begins to unfold for two young astrologers who have the ability to read the future in the stars. Elsewhere, a young man named Naosuke Oyama dreams of becoming a warrior in the land of Shikkoku, despite his family`s long legacy of raising generations of dancers in Kikyo.\nYears ago, Naosuke found and rescued an injured boy named Yuma. Yuma was accepted as a member of the Oyama family and grew up as Naosuke`s assistant and companion. One day, when the two young men are threatened by ruffians in the city, Shikkoku warriors Hajime, Kakeru, and Koi come to their aid. Now determined more than ever to become a warrior, Naosuke decides to embark on a journey with Yuma and—on the recommendation of astrologer Takaaki—bodyguards Issa and Futaba. Soon, the travelers are threatened by shadowy figures who seem to be chasing after Yuma.\nSource: crunchyroll",
