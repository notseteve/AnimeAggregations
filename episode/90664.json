  "description" : "Joining the tennis club turns out to be the worst decision of Kotoko`s college life. The grueling practices, the painful injuries and the complete feeling of incompetence would be worth it...if only Naoki would show up to practice!! Meanwhile, Kotoko works up the courage to ask Naoki to the latest \"couple`s movie\", but of course Naoki flat out refuses. Kotoko decides to go to the movie anyway but is shocked to see Naoki there with none other than Yuuko Matsumoto!? Can Kotoko really compete with someone so perfectly matched to Naoki?\nSource: theTVDB.com",
