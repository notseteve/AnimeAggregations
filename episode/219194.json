  "description" : "Asta was taken deep back into the labyrinth by Raia, who had suddenly appeared. There, he found not only Mimosa, but Klaus, Hamon, and Yuno who had reincarnated as elves. Klaus and Hamon have completely different personalities and they attack Asta. However, Yuno doesn’t join the fight yet one way or another. Asta doesn’t want to fight his friends and says that he’s going to survive and become the Wizard King. That somehow brings out a change in Yuno. Meanwhile, there was someone else watching the battle quietly: Another Licht that looked just like “the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun Licht.” Apparently, he is the real Licht, the leader of the elves.\nSource: crunchyroll",
