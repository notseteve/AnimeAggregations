  "description" : "The Warrior of the Dragon, elder of the Tatsumi Brothers, is a superficially arrogant but cool-headed warrior who acts as commander in his collaborations with his brother. Using his \"Heaven`s Holding\" ability to remain in the air, he watches over Snake, now a \"Walking Dead,\" waiting for his own chance to join in the battle. While he does so, he thinks back on a trial that they became subject to as a result of their actions on a different battlefield.\nSource: crunchyroll",
