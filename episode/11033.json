The sinister Dr. Wheelo has been freed from his icy tomb at long last. But before these two mad scientists can take over the world with their biotechnology, the doctor is in dire need of a mighty body in which to place his even more fearsome brain. Seeking out the most powerful fighters on the planet, both Piccolo and Master Roshi are brought before the deranged doctor. Yet just as their friends rush in to save them, it`s revealed that Goku is actually the world`s strongest. Things look grim as Dr. Wheelo turns friend against friend as wits and will are matched.\nSource: crunchyroll",
