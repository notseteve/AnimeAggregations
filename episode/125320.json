However... Bunji is invited to Chinatsu`s house for dinner.  He was lectured by Chinatsu on everything from the gift to bring to how to use a knife and fork, but things don`t go right... Bunji comes home making puns left and right as puns have become the popular thing at school.  As they come to him, he tries one pun after another on Mom and Ai.  In the end, he`s even trying them on Mr. Mizunuma. As autumn becomes winter, Mom remembers about when she was young and moving to the city.  She had huge hopes, but her worries were even larger.  At that time, Mom loved to visit the zoo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
