  "description" : "Ash and Goh return to Galar to investigate reports of Pokémon Dynamaxing in unusual locations. When their train stops due to fog, they disembark and get separated. Each of them has a strange encounter with a mysterious Pokémon, then falls asleep. After awakening, Ash arrives on the scene of a rampaging Gigantamax Centiskorch—and Leon shows up to defeat it! The two of them set off to stop the rest of the out-of-control Dynamax Pokémon. Meanwhile, Goh runs into Sonia, and they head to Turffield to check out some ruins that could be associated with the ongoing crisis. Although our heroes are on separate paths for now, their journey continues!\nSource: Official Website",
