  "description" : "With tickets to see Leon battle Galar’s Dragon-type Gym Leader Raihan in the World Coronation Series, our heroes couldn’t be more excited! Both competitors are strong, but the undefeated Leon wins again!\nThen, after hearing about a young hero who once saved Galar from the effects of a devastating storm, Ash and Goh come across a Galarian Farfetch’d. Although it’s similar to Goh’s Farfetch’d from Kanto, this regional form carries a huge leek that it uses in battle. The Galarian Farfetch’d has been challenging any Trainer who crosses its path—and after battling it and being impressed by its tenacity, Ash welcomes it as the newest member of his team!\nSource: Official Website",
