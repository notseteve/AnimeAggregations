  "description" : "Roscoe and his family of Texas Prairie Dogs are deluged with waste oil seeping into their burrows from a Ratco refinery plant.

Our heroes are almost swallowed up by the horrible oil but manage to give the Rats a taste of their own medicine and save the Prairie Dogs.\nSource: bcdb.com",
