  "description" : "A swim in the rooftop \"lake\" leaves Taromaru covered in nasty green algae, leaving Yuki \nto give him a bath and the rest of the club to take care of her equally dirty laundry. As the four stand under the sun watching the clothes dry, the conversation turns to \"graduation\" and their plans for the future. Later that night, a bout of insomnia leads Mii-kun and Rii-san to search for the lock to Megu-nee`s secret key.\nSource: crunchyroll",
