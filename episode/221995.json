  "description" : "Animosity continues to grow between Reinhard and Lichtenlade, the guardians of the young emperor Erwin, and the pure-blooded noble families with Braunschweig and Littenheim at their center. In the midst of all this, Hilda, the only daughter of Count Mariendorf, visits the Fleet Admiral`s Mansion on Odin to meet with Reinhard. When he asks what brought on the sudden visit, she tells him that the Mariendorf household would like to side with Reinhard in the civil war that could break out at any moment.\nSource: crunchyroll",
