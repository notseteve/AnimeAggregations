  "description" : "I`m Mazama Jin. I just started at Seton Academy this spring. There, I met a sweet, pure, beautiful girl named Hino Hitomi-san. We immediately hit it off and started a cooking club, where we spend every day coming up with new recipes together. Could this be a rehearsal for our future?! That`s the healthy, fulfilling school life... that I would be living right now if this wasn`t a school for animals.\nSource: crunchyroll",
