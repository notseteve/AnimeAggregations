  "description" : "Tsuna and his friends run into Mr. Kawahira. Mr. Kawahira is a regular at the ramen shop where I-Pin works ten years in the future. Tsuna and the gang remember hearing his name from the future I-Pin when she arrived using the Ten-Year Bazooka. For some reason, Mr. Kawahira knows about the real six Funeral Wreaths, and he tells the gang that he will give them refuge. It all seems kind of suspicious, but Tsuna and his friends decide to take Mr. Kawahira up on his offer. Meanwhile, at Namimori Middle, the battle between Daisy, Dino, and Hibari gets off to a start!\nSource: crunchyroll",
