  "description" : "Rohan has a feeling that Josuke is cheating at cee-lo, and cuts off his own pinky. If he is unable to figure out Josuke`s trick in the next round, he says he will pay him 2 million yen to have him use Shining Diamond to fix his finger. But if Rohan does figure it out, he says he`ll take Josuke`s pinky instead. He even calls Tamami to act as a mediator, having him use his Stand ability so Josuke can`t play fairly the next round, either.\nSource: crunchyroll",
