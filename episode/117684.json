  "description" : "Our heroes are in the Arctic to check why fewer Polar Bears are being sighted. They discover that Ratco is dumping refrigerators that he failed to sell to the Eskimo population. Their CFCs are depleting the Ozone above the ice caps, causing the Polar Bears to seek protection from the harmful UV rays under the ice. Our heroes report the dump to the authorities, thereby making it safe once more for the Polar Bears to roam.\nSource: bcdb.com",
