  "description" : "Frederica is gradually backed into a corner by Elsa`s attacks. Then Garfiel rushes to the scene with a silver shield on each arm. The siblings` reunion after so many years is cut short when Elsa`s knife violently clashes against Garfiel`s shield. Meanwhile, Subaru heads to the forbidden library where Beatrice is. She`s surprised when he enters the library and tells her that, after she spent 400 years there under a contract that might as well have been a curse, he`s going to get her out.\nSource: crunchyroll",
