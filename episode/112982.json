  "description" : "Ul gave her life to seal Deliora, and Gray is attacking in order to prevent that from happening, even if it costs him his life. On the other side of things, Natsu faces off against the masked weirdo, Zalty. Somehow Zalty used time manipulation magic to undo Natsu`s tilting of the ruins, and the Moon Drip ceremony has restarted! The ice is melting, and Deliora gives off a roar! It`s only a matter of time until the demon of disaster is resurrected... And if it does, what is Gray prepared to do to stop it?\nSource: crunchyroll",
