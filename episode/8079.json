  "description" : "Finally, the guys made it to Forest Terminal but no one was there. Down the road at a castle they met Socerimon & Seraphimon, who told everyone how the Legendary Warriors came to be. Then Grumblemon and the other goons attacked! Mercurymon beat Seraphimon and all that was left of him was a Digi-Egg. Takuya & the others escaped on a Trailmon but Socerimon stayed behind to fight. Now they are left alone with the Digi-Egg and they don`t even know what to do with it until Ophanimon is found.\nSource: crunchyroll",
