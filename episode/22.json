Misato has already arranged the band`s debut in a live radio show; Kyouta invites Yoriko to come along but Misato treats her coldly, telling her that she will protect the band from \"bad influence and scandals\". After the live performance a fan crowd waits in front of the radio station; when they notice the band leaving via the back door Kyouta and Yoriko take a run, only to be dragged into a waiting car by a beautiful woman.",
