  "description" : "Festival season has come to the village of Flatta. The festival has been held there for the past 250 years, but as the only person who knows its entire history since it was started, Azusa has distanced herself from it to let the villagers keep their independence. But her family has shown interest in it and seems excited to see it, so she makes up her mind to change the way she interacts with the village tradition... and thus the one-day-only coffee shop, The Witch`s House, was born. Will the villagers enjoy this little shop Azusa`s family has created?\nSource: crunchyroll",
