  "description" : "A massive fleet led by Oskar von Reuenthal appears in the Iserlohn Corridor. Boasting overwhelming numerical superiority over the defending Alliance forces, the Imperial commander is confident he can crush his opponent in a quick and easy victory. Back on Heinessen, Bewcock warns admirals and MPs that the Empire may be following a less-obvious strategy this time, thus immediate action must be taken to avert the worst. And Yang realizes that his greatest problem of all may not be the approaching enemy ahead, but the supposed friends behind him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
