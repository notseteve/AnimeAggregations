  "description" : "Tamaki has been using his invisibility powers to attempt to spy on the Supernatural Research Club and learn what they know about the Seventh Witch, not realising that his powers don`t work on Yamada, who deceives him into believing they aren`t making any progress. Miyamura introduces the club to his sister, Leona, who dropped out of school, terrified of the Seventh Witch`s powers to make people forget everything about the witches.\nYamada later meets the Seventh Witch, Saionji Rika, whose powers seem not to require a kiss. He seems unaffected, and still seems to remember everything. He returns to the Supernatural Research Club and is shocked to find that Saionji`s powers have instead affected everyone else, and because they knew him only from their work with the witches, they have all, including Shiraishi, forgotten about him. He teams up with Tamaki, who seems to be the only other person in school who seems to remember anything.\nTamaki suggests a plan that requires Odagiri`s charm powers, so Yamada convinces her to kiss him. As they do this, Shiraishi sees them, and she bursts into tears without understanding why.",
