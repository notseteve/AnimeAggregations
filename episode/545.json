  "description" : "At the baseball training the coaches are talking about talented but lazy Yoshihiko who might have become the leader of the team long ago if he even cared. Yoshihiko`s next hit is a major foul, driving the ball into an open window of the school library. While searching the library for the lost ball he knocks against some ladder, and the girl standing on it, just trying to put a book back onto the uppermost shelf, is falling down ... but Yoshihiko manages to catch her before she can hit the ground. And just moments later he`s rewarded with a kiss!",
