  "description" : "Houka Inumuta uses his Three-Star Goku Uniform, Probe Regalia, to analyze Ryuko`s fighting abilities and to anticipate her movements. When Ryuko counteracts this by fighting haphazardly, Houka resorts to cloaking himself and fighting her while invisible. Ryuko counters again by expanding and draping Senketsu`s eye across the battle arena, leaving him unable to evade, and then swatting the entire platform. Unwilling to lose the data he has gathered on Senketsu, Houka forfeits the match before Ryuko can destroy his uniform. Nonon Jakuzure is next; she activates her Three-Star Goku Uniform, Symphony Regalia, which initially is an array of speakers that attacks with sound, but later transforms into a hovering airship. She attempts to eliminate Ryuko by destroying the battle arena, but Ryuko activates a new aerial form, Senketsu Shippu, to remain in the match. Troubled by how quickly Senketsu has been evolving, Aikuro contacts Tsumugu, who makes his way to Honnouji Academy.",
