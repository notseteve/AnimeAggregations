  "description" : "\"I`m sure we`ll both still do things we regret in the future, but let`s work through them and keep going.\"\nAfter acquiring the Illusion Kiss brand ambassador job, Ayumu falls ill with a high fever. Members of both ROCK DOWN and VAZZY visit Ayumu in bed to bring him food and gifts as he recovers. Reiji, however, is nowhere to be seen. Could there be a reason for that? Ayumu becomes depressed while relying on his friends` care as he starts to remember how physically weak he was as a child. He also remembers one time in the past when he became ill before a job and Reiji came up to say something to him. Ayumu wasn`t able to accept what Reiji was trying to say then, but can he now?\nSource: crunchyroll",
