  "description" : "Chizuru loses the position of class representative to Rena. Realizing she was preoccupied with her feelings for Arata, Chizuru confronts Ryo asking him if Arata is a ReLIFE subject. He doesn`t want to confirm it, warning her that exposing a test subject would end the experiment for him and they would never see each other again. Ryo reveals to her that An works for ReLIFE and is her new supervisor. An suggests Chizuru wants Arata to be a test subject, as she could act on her feelings if he were a grown-up. After Kazuomi talks Arata into volunteering as the boys` representative heading the preparations for the cultural festival, Chizuru volunteers for the girls.\nSource: Wikipedia",
