  "description" : "Tsunade comes face to face with Tendo Pain on the rooftop of the Hokage mansion. When Pain demands the Nine Tails be handed over, Tsunade refuses. However, Pain uses the Ningendo’s power to learn of Naruto’s current location in Mount Myoboku. Tsunade clenches at the sight of the growing number of casualties within the Leaf. But Pain, who condemns the Leaf’s arrogance as a major nation, makes the choice to deliver catastrophic damage against the Leaf Village to teach them what true pain is.\nSource: crunchyroll",
