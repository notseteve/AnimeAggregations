  "description" : "Just as the new school term began, another transfer student joined our class. It was Meiling, Xiaolang`s bride to be, and she`d just arrived from Hong Kong! Meanwhile, the Fight card appeared and began taking on skilled martial artists all across the city. Sakura headed to Penguin Park to seal it away, but out of nowhere Meiling appeared to challenge the card! Unfortunately, she was no match for it and started to lose ground, but then Sakura jumped in and used her Power card to seal Fight away! But Meiling couldn`t stand the fact that Sakura was the one to save her, and only made her view of Sakura as her rival that much stronger.\nSource: crunchyroll",
