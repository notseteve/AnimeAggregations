  "description" : "The plan begins to lure out the Cabernet, which has buried itself into the ground, with the recently recovered Connor. But they do not know where it is hiding, where it is heading, or what place it will resurface at. At the same time, Reverse`s plans are reaching their final stage at last. In order to raise the strength of the Cabernet even further, Lawrence will use the fortified \"hearts\" of the ones who were unable to become spirit, and transports them all to the appointed place.\nSource: crunchyroll",
