He is wandering all around Candy Land in search for his Happitat. As Panky showed Happi the whole place, he then took him to Chevy and Coron and introduced him. That night, Panky himself felt concerned that he doesn`t have a place to stay and the next day, the three decided to build him his own Happitat.

Until Chip and Tap`s appearance helped them.\nChevy the Master Detective: The trio went to the Rainbow Fountain one day to see it was empty and dry. Chevy himself decided to solve the case by being a detective until the Black Candies showed up, but ended up being interrogated. Blacky and his lackeys were then proven innocent on the case, leading the three to search for clues. Blacky himself then blamed Chevy on the fountain until Coron found a clue: a lollipop. Panna arrived at the scene saying the helmet from the statue was gone. As the arrived there, they all say the saw lollipop and a strange mark on the ground, thinking it was Chevy`s doing.
