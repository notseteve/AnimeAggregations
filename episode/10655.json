  "description" : "After the pro wrestling event, everyone slowly starts to change. Shinnosuke makes a resolution in his heart and leaves on a solitary voyage. Maki, on the other hand, is rendered completely dumb after the match. She isn`t giving off the same aura she had while in the ring! Dumbfounded by this, Kaori Sakiyama begins to preach to Maki and confesses that she was fired from her job. Kaori then drags Maki to work the same part-time job she took up. Her job is to play the villain in the High Rangers hero show at the amusement park. Maki is up there, dumb as ever, with a bunch of wannabe fighters on stage. Then, the enemy leader that Sakiyama is playing, Empress Cockroach, enters the stage! Sakiyama is a natural to play this role and the children are likewise truly frightened. She kicks Maki to the side as the show heats up. Maki seems to be wondering what the heck she is doing on stage and then she comes attacking out of nowhere! Now the real hero show will begin!\nSource: crunchyroll",
