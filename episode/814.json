  "description" : "Haru must destroy the Shadow Stone place in the middle of Go`s hammer. Elie memory is jogged once again, which causes her to throw Plue into the hammer, breaking the Shadow Stone and the hammer. Due to this, Go is asked to stop the rain. He brings out a machine that caused the rain, having six unlabeled buttons. Since Go doesn`t remember which button stops the rain, Plue pushes one of them, being successful. As Haru, Elie, Plue were about to leave, Go mentions to them about Sieg Hart, who is an elemental master, the person in Elie`s memory. Ska Village returns to normal, with a clear blue sky. Meanwhile, Shuda is searching for a Rave Stone in Tremolo Mountain.\nSource: Wikipedia",
