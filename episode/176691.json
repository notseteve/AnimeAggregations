  "description" : "After repulsing the Kshatriya, Banagher loses consciousness, and along with the Unicorn Gundam, he is retrieved by the Earth Federation Forces warship Nahel Argama. The ship has also rescued Audrey, as well as Banagher`s friends Takuya and Micott. Zinnerman of the Sleeves detects the Nahel Argama`s position via a clever trap, and the ship comes under a fierce attack by Full Frontal, known as the second coming of the Red Comet, and his mobile suit Sinanju. Audrey begs Banagher to escape the ship with her in order to dispose of the Unicorn Gundam, the key to Laplace`s Box. But Daguza of the Federation`s ECOAS special forces group takes her prisoner, demanding that Frontal halt his attack. For Audrey is actually Mineva Zabi, the Zeon princess.\nSource: crunchyroll",
