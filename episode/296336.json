  "description" : "“All of us will work together and become one unit.” Suzuri-led GRAVEL resolves to walk a different path “together” as they take the extended hand of Roppo Ichiza. Shizuka, whose decision would have made everyone sad, sincerely apologizes and expresses her gratitude to Tsubakino and Kanji. Just then, as they have reconciled and everyone’s feelings are in sync, a former Furin student named Endo, covered in tattoos from his back to his shoulders and arms, appears.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
