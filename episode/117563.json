Only those who finish their lunches fast in Bunji`s class can have seconds. Because Daichi is out today, his pudding remains. The speed-eating battle for the pudding begins! Dad says he wants to go get ramen noodles in the middle of the night. Bunji goes along with him to his favorite noodle shop, but it`s closed. They decide to go find a new place!
