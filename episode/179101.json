  "description" : "War breaks out in the far north, as the Empire`s oppression of the mountain people results in a terrifying backlash. With the one competent leader in the Northern Garrison assassinated, the ignorant garrison commander flings the troops headlong into a highly defended, mountainous position, with disastrous results.  Ikta and his friends are kept as part of the reserves for now, but it won`t be long until they`re thrust into the war as well.\nSource: crunchyroll",
