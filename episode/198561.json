  "description" : "It is the fifth day of the training, and now they have only two days left. However, the four dragon pilots are not close enough yet. Eru in particular has been in an awkward position because of her harsh attitude toward F-2. She could no longer bear up under the stress and attempted an escape alone on a raft, but was caught in tidal waves. On the other hand, Hisone, Ririko and Mayumi found a secret of the island in the cave where they escaped from the storm.\nSource: Official page",
