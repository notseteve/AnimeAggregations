A coal mining town crowded with small-scale excavators, commonly known as the \"Hakoniwa.\" In this town that changes daily like a labyrinth, there`s a girl named Kagari who runs a mapmaking business and a boy named Yuya who dreams of breaking free from the \"Hakoniwa.\" Eventually, the two, along with the unique residents of the town, find themselves confronting a conspiracy that shakes the entire town. The fate of the‚Äù Hakoniwa\" depends on Kagari`s drawings on the map.\nSource: crunchyroll",
