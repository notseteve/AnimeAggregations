  "description" : "Rindou, Lenka, and Sakuya fly a helicopter up to the transport plane, which is about to be overrun by flying Aragami. Rindou attempts to get Alisa to evacuate the plane for their helicopter, but she refuses, and goes out onto the plane`s fuselage and tries to fight off the Aragami attacking it. Soon enough her situation becomes desperate as there are too many of the monsters and they begin to evolve into more powerful forms, and Rindou and Lenka jump to the plane to try to take her off it by force. Lenka learns why she refuses to leave: the plane is actually full of injured people: a disaster seems to have befallen the Russia branch. He tells Rindou of this and he decides to help. Lenka begins to learn from Alisa how to use his abilities as a New Type. They are called `God Eaters` because they can use their God Arcs to literally consume the Aragami. They eventually succeed in getting most of the Aragami to ignore the plane by sacrificing the helicopter.  In the distance, they see a truly immense Aragami flying.",
