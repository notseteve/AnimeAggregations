  "description" : "Takemoto cooks for the carpenter, and they seem to like the food he prepares. Takemoto calculates that he will work for ten days until he is able to buy a new bicycle. Meanwhile at the Fujiwara Design Office, Rika ask if Yamada could work with her, since she takes an interest in Yamada`s pottery. Mayama becomes worried when he hears the news. Takemoto reluctantly wants to stay with the carpenters, since they love his cooking. He gradually starts finding himself after bonding with the carpenters. One of the carpenters lends Takemoto his bicycle as well as a map, giving Takemoto quite a surprise. The carpenters say farewell to Takemoto, as he leaves to finish the rest of his journey. \nSource: Wikipedia",
