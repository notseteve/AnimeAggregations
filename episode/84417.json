  "description" : "Okita and Kagura break through the front lines and clash with Nishino, a large man who`s one of the Great Four. But Okita and Kagura are on bad terms and end up hurting each other. Kagura injures her right hand and Okita injures his right leg. The two decide to cooperate rather than lose and take on Nishino once more by piggyback! Meanwhile, a battle between Hijikata and Kitaoji begins at a dinner table. Hijikata`s sharp fighting intuition becomes a handicap. He becomes cornered by Kitaoji, who makes use of feints. But Hijikata is used to battle, and slowly he adapts himself to his opponent`s fighting style and shows his true power!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
