  "description" : "The Warabis close in on Urawa Hosei`s goal with an attack focused around Nozomi, but at the last second, they fail to score the first point of the game. As both teams struggle for dominance, Urawa Hosei takes advantage of a split-second opportunity, and their eccentric forward Alice Adatara scores the first point. The Warabis attempt to even the score, while Urawa Hosei`s attacks centered around forwards Tenma and Adatara continue.\nSource: crunchyroll",
