  "description" : "Tachibana Mia is afraid that her unreliable and perverted brother Jun`ichi will become a total failure in life, and never get a girlfriend. She`s quite surprised that her classmates Ai and Sae tell her otherwise, both confirming they consider Jun`ichi a nice guy. Thus Mia begins to spy on her brother, learning about even more girls he`s quite friendly to, but none of them being a potential girlfriend. A horrible idea comes to her mind: Could it be that Jun`ichi actually likes boys?",
