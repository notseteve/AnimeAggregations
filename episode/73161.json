  "description" : "Even though all her friends are helping Lisa confess her feelings, Ōtani is so dense in that regard that he doesn`t get it.\nEven worse, Ōtani doubles down on his cluelessness and asks her who she likes so he can help with the confession.\nIt`s Lisa`s birthday.\nŌtani asks Lisa to come to the station skyrise.\nAs his present, he secured two special seats just for them to watch the fireworks from there.\nThat kind gesture deepens her feelings for him even more, and Lisa blurts out her confession.\n\"...I... I love you Ōtani!\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
