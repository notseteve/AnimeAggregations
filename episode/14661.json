  "description" : "Haman has set the asteroid Axis on a collision course with the Gate of Zedan, and the AEUG now launch an all-out attack on the Gate of Zedan to prevent the Titan fleet from escaping the impact. Scirocco, watching the battle from the sidelines, sends Reccoa to rescue Sarah from captivity aboard the Argama. And as the AEUG and Titan fleets clash, the Axis forces take advantage of the confusion to seize control of the Gryps 2 colony laser.\nSource: crunchyroll",
