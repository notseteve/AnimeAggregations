  "description" : "The members of Senkou High School`s literature club become shocked when Andou July, a boy usually known for his chuunibyou delusions, suddenly develops superpowers of his own. Six months later, each of the club members have since developed their own superpowers, which they put to the test in their monthly check-up. When student council member Kudou Mirei comes to check on the club, she ends up misinterpreting July`s chuunibyou behavior and inadvertently reveals that she herself has developed superpowers as well. Mirei challenges the club to a superpower battle, using her own ability to steal July`s \"Dark and Dark\" ability, only to find it to be nothing more than a useless lukewarm flame. With the other members knowing not to show off their powers before her, they easily beat Mirei in a physical match. Learning that Mirei learned of the club`s powers from an anonymous text, the group become curious about just who sent it. \nSource: Wikipedia",
