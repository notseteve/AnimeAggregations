Kory suddenly appears and steals Kiyo`s book from Steng and while dodging Baltro`s attacks, returns Kiyo`s book. Folgore and Kanchome meanwhile manage to free themselves allowing Kiyo and Zatch to defeat Steng and Baltro.

Kiyo, Zatch, and Kory manage to rescue everyone in the castle including Kiyo`s father. Steng and Baltro while running away from the castle, meets the Mamodo who hired Steng. The Mamodo fires blue lightning and Baltro`s book is burnt.",
