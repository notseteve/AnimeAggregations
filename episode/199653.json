  "description" : "Berthold is known far and wide as a devil of sorts. There are few in the ancient city who don’t fear him. But even a man as intimidating as he has something he cannot eat: squid. Unfortunately for him, he is soon to meet with a squid fisherman’s daughter for a potential arranged marriage. He comes to Nobuyuki hoping to squash his distaste for squid by trying a multitude of different dishes, but no matter how hard he tries, he can’t even bring himself to take a single bite. Roasted dry squid, squid sashimi, minced squid balls, fried calamari… Nevermind salted squid guts. Just what IS Berthold’s beef with squid...?\nSource: crunchyroll",
