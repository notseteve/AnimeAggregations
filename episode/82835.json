  "description" : "Yamamoto decides to fight using the Shigure Kintoki, the sword handed to him by his father that can only used with Shigure Soen Ryu forms. With no time left, the Rain Guardian battle begins with everyone looking on! It is difficult to get good footing in Aquarion, the battlefield, because of the ever-falling water. Tsuna and his friends are relieved that Yamamoto is able to stave off Squalo`s fierce attacks. But Dino, an acquaintance of Squalo`s, is still worried. Dino`s hunch is correct when Squalo sees through Yamamoto`s attack and even breaks through Yamamoto`s defensive techniques.\nSource: crunchyroll",
