  "description" : "Subaru heads into his living room to find Haru curled up asleep in front of the window. She looks so comfortable napping in the sun`s rays that Subaru can`t resist stretching out on the floor nearby to read some reference materials, but he soon falls asleep. Then he starts to dream about his own chidhood... Meanwhile, Haru wakes up and sees Subaru sleeping, so she decides to prepare some food for him. She finds a can of cat food in the kitchen, but as she`s struggling to get the food out of it, someone suddenly appears behind her!\nSource: crunchyroll",
