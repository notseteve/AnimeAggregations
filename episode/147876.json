  "description" : "The heroine arrives at a fantastic god`s home. The god is away, but she finds a massive sack of flour, and with a sense of nostalgia, offers to bake it into cookies. As she does, her last bit of intelligence is fleeting out the window when she bites into a cookie and starts to regain her senses instead. She realizes she must eat all the cookies herself to return to normal, which she does, and returns to everyday life with most of her intelligence restored.",
