  "description" : "Rikka stays up late at night playing card games with Hotaru, and ends up being late to a Sunday Guardian meeting where they`re preparing for a graduation party. Back at her home, the X Eggs notice that she forgot to bring paints with her, and try to help out Rikka because they feel neglected with Hotaru taking up Rikka`s attention lately, but they only screw up and make things worse. Rikka doesn`t realize they were trying to help, however, and yells at them all.\nSource: crunchyroll",
