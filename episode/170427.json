  "description" : "Beerus and Whis arrive on Earth, where Bulma`s birthday party is underway. Initially, Vegeta is paralyzed by Beerus` presence. He recalls a childhood encounter with the deity a long time ago when Beerus visited Planet Vegeta and threatened his father, King Vegeta. Shortly after, Bulma pops up. She invites Beerus and Whis to join the party. Beerus gladly accepts her offer and enjoys the food available. The two start mingling with the other guests, while Vegeta tries his best to ensure that Beerus remains calm. Whis soon learns of pudding, which he finds to be extraordinary delicious; so much so that he urges Beerus to have some too. It turns out that Majin Buu had taken the remaining pudding cups for himself and refuses to share. Angered by Majin Buu`s insolence, Beerus attacks him.\nSource: Wikipedia",
