  "description" : "Panky, Became Bad?: Chevy herself frightened Panky while the trio were going into the forest. Somewhat being a coward, Panky flees before the two found him outside the forest and talked about his cowardly personality as he runs away again. As he encounters the Black Candies, he then asked them if they can accept him in their group, surprising the group. The group taught him what they know, even making him as bad as they are. Though this attempt separates him from his real friends as Chevy and Coron tried to do something to make him leave the group.\nGinseng Flavored Chim: The Trio were picking flowers one day in the forests of Candy Land as Chevy felt bored. She then saw an Elephant Zooble and the group asked him, but he responded harshly due to Chevy stepping into the grass. Later on, Chevy started to feel weird as Pom arrives. He explains to them about her condition and the cure, which can only be done by Chim, a Korean Ginseng-flavored Zooble. Coron and Panky encountered Chim and told them about Chevy`s condition, thought it never did go well while talking. Coron and Panky were almost out of options, and Chevy is almost close to dying. How will the two get out of this situation?",
