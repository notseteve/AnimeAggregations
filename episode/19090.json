After working late on the upcoming school festival, she is walked home by a male schoolmate. Koshiro encounters them and shouts at her for being so incautious with boys. She protests her innocence and his jealousy shows when he blurts out that she has to be careful because she is cute. Next day she avoids him by leaving early and gets jostled and groped on the train. They have a talk that evening and make up. Next day, he makes a point of going with her and protects her on the train from the crowd.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
