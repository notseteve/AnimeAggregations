  "description" : "Prefectural Final for the National High School Soccer Tournament. Isagi Yoichi, a first-year forward, loses his chance for the Nationals because he has passed the ball to his fellow player in front of the goal. That`s when he receives an invitation for Blue Lock. It`s a facility to train one world`s greatest striker out of 300 high-school-aged forwards so that Japan can win the World Cup. Isagi and others are assembled in a small room, and they take their first test to decide which 11 of them get to move in to the dorm out of 12 of them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
