  "description" : "A girl named Nina visits the Handymen, explaining how her employer, a back-alley doctor named Theo, has been threatened by a group of thugs, including a so-called \"dog tag\". While Nicolas heads to Theo`s clinic with Nina, Worick runs across some of the thugs outside their office, who were supposed to have abducted Nina, but he manages to quickly kill them all, much to Alex`s shock. Nicolas and Nina arrive at the clinic to find more of the thugs threatening Theo, including the \"dog tag\", a large, muscular black man whose dog tags give him a rank of B/2. They fight, although Nicolas initially doesn`t seem to take the fight seriously, causing some damage to the clinic and nearby buildings. After the black man is defeated it is seen that Nicolas is himself a \"dog tag\", with a rank of A/0, far outclassing his opponent. Worick explains to Alex about the \"dog tags\", strange people with abnormally high physical and fighting abilities who are widely feared in Ergustulum.",
