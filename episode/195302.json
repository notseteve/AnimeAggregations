  "description" : "After accepting Matsuri`s forceful invitation to hang out after school, Yuzu takes Mei with her to the station where Matsuri`s waiting. Matsuri greets Mei with a cold stare, having believed she`d meet Yuzu alone, and then she grabs Yuzu`s hand and happily drags her around the shopping mall. However, Yuzu`s constantly thinking of Mei, which upsets Matsuri until she finally calls Yuzu cruel and runs away from the two of them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
