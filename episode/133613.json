  "description" : "Saber and Lancer fight, while complimenting each other on their skills and chivalry. At the same time, Kiritsugu and Maiya are scouting the battle, with Kiritsugu spotting Lancer`s hidden Master. As he is about to snipe him, Kiritsugu spots Assassin, who is relaying the battle to Kirei and Tokiomi. Lancer`s Master orders him to use his Noble Phantasms, Gae Dearg, the anti-magic spear and Gae Buidhe, the cursed spear that inflicts wounds that cannot be healed. From these, Saber recognizes Lancer as Diarmuid of the Love Spot, while Lancer discovers Saber`s identity after using Gae Dearg to temporarily dispel the invisibility spell on her sword. Saber, whose left tendon was wounded by Lancer`s Gae Buidhe, is about to give it her all when Rider, who was watching the battle from afar, suddenly rides down to the harbor on his chariot, interrupting the battle.",
