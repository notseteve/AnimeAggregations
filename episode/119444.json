  "description" : "Oasis has no quests assigned, but everyone is very busy, so no one is around to play with Minette, except Garnet, who suddenly materialises as she was getting bored in the dragon world. Nina asks Minette to buy the ingredients for the night`s dinner, which she happily does, considering it as her own personal quest for the day. The Tortilla sisters have also been asked to silently watch her and make sure that she is all right. Minette and Garnet go around town trying to collect everything from Nina`s list, and see the various members of Oasis about their duties, Agnes doing her puppet show in the square, Carina at the cathedral, and Chelsea wandering around lost. Garnet leaves to assist Chelsea in getting to her meeting with the knights at the cathedral, and Minette has to get to the butcher`s by herself. Along the way she meets with a girl named Miriam and they quickly become friends, and she shows Minette a short cut to the butcher`s. Along the way they see a cat stuck at the top of a high ledge, and Minette tries to rescue it and falls, but Leicester is there to catch her. They return the cat to its owner, who is grateful.\nMinette returns to the clan house, without the meat from the butcher`s shop. However, the cat Minette rescued actually belonged to the butcher, so he asked the Tortillas to bring them a premium cut of meat as thanks for saving his pet.",
