The secret agreement Kitaro made with King Enma for Cat-girl`s resurrection is revealed to the Sand-throwing Hag and the others - to capture the Four Generals of Betrayal who have escaped from Hell. If he fails, Cat-girl must return to Hell, and Kitaro`s spirit will be bound there forever. The Nue appears in Tokyo again, and Kitaro goes to confront it. Will Kitaro be able to capture the Nue? What is the Way of the Demon Society, and what is the aim of the mysterious boy, Rei?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
