But when the new girl turns out to be a monster, they`ll have to become \"a magical girl who`s anxious to fight the enemy that`s right in front of them, and a magical girl who`s started to get worried about things at the worst possible time, and a perverted magical girl who`s getting excited to realize that he`s actually a boy!\"  Can they break out of the spell and transform by giving a plausible explanation for what they`d do with 150 crabs?\nSource: crunchyroll",
