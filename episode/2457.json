  "description" : "It is Spring, and Miyazawa Yukino has entered Hokuei Prefectural High School. With her looks, good grades, excellent athletic ability, and winning personality, she soon becomes the darling of her class. The truth, though, is that this is all a facade. Yukino is deathly concerned about how other people see her. Arima Souichiroo, a boy in her class, threatens her very existence as a result. A handsome boy who entered the school at the top of the entrance exams, he steals Yukino`s place as class representative, and steadily encroaches on her popularity in class. She feels an intense rivalry toward him.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
