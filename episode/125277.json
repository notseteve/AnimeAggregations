  "description" : "The evil Lucemon absorbs all the dark power sealed in the Heaven Zone, even drawing in Nene in the process. Her partner Sparrowmon tries to save her, but his attacks have no effect and he refuses to cooperate with Taiki and Shoutmon. When Lucemon starts to absorb the Heaven Zone itself and all the Digimon in it, Taiki`s team tries to stop him, but can`t reach him since Shoutmon X4 can`t fly. Sparrowmon finally sees that Taiki`s intentions are true and agrees to DigiXros with Shoutmon X4, giving rise to Shoutmon X5!\nSource: crunchyroll",
