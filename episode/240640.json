  "description" : "Shirokusa and Kuroha have agreed to appear in the drama for the true ending that`s set to be released at the same time as the documentary. Kuroha, the last to interview Sueharu, looks back on her memories with him. She was there before he became an actor, the moment he became a star, and after he left show business, watching from right by his side. The place she`s chosen to bring him for the interview is their \"secret base,\" the place where they opened up to each other long ago.\nSource: crunchyroll",
