The damage to Rhino Bone is severe, and it`s uncertain if it will recover at all. Tyrone watches the recovery process in concern. Meanwhile, things are happening on Nepos Angelis. Pellbrand and Barlish call for Revolt to be relieved of his council leadership because of his suspicious actions. But a member of the council, Dark Basilisk`s adept, Raquelt, throws in his support of Revolt. And despite finding Revolt`s actions strange, he goes to recover Dragon Bone for him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
