  "description" : "We open to Kanata fidgeting atop a chair. A broken bottle, wet clothes... Seeing the disarray that the mess hall is in, Kanata cannot help but think thoughts of regret and retrospection. Even doing all that, when she has to put up with it... And yet before her tear-ladened eyes rests a black phone that has yet to ring. Private-second-class Kanata Sorami, currently on the mission to confirm maintenance to the HQ-command line for high-level emergency situations.\nSource: crunchyroll",
