  "description" : "Brother burglars who have stolen a billion yen`s worth of gold nuggets run away into Melmo`s house and hole up, taking Melmo and her brothers hostage. But their gun suddenly goes off and they faint. The police are in trouble because they won`t wake up and the police cannot get a confession on the whereabouts of the gold nuggets. Melmo takes her candies in order to grow up, and makes the awakened burglars believe that 10 years have passed since the incident. She figures that by making them believe such a long time has lapsed they would rush off to get the gold nuggets. But to her surprise the burglars start to cry over their little sister, thinking that she must be dead for over 10 years now. They were, in fact, committing burglary to get money for an operation for their sick sister. \nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
