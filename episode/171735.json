  "description" : "Yato learns about Suzuha, and that he is supposedly one of Bishamon`s shinki, although he seems to know nothing at all Yato nor his master`s enmity with him, so he permits Yukine to continue being friends with him as long as he is careful. It turns out Suzuha had not been personally called upon by Bishamon in years, and he befriended a human girl named Tomoko a long time ago and she had forgotten about him as she grew older, though he continues to hope that she will someday remember. Suzuha is then murdered by ayakashi under the control of Kugaha, yet another of Bishamon`s shinki, who seems to be secretly working with Nora to destroy Bishamon.\nThe mysterious death of Suzuha has affected Bishamon, and at one point Kazuma sees that she has signs of being blighted, so he calls all of the shinki and has them inspected by Kugaha, and finds that none of them are contaminated by ayakashi. When she comes down to see what is happening, Kazuma sees that the stain he saw on her has somehow disappeared.\nYukine tries to introduce Suzuha to Yato and Hiyori but finds he is not at his usual cherry tree. Later, Yato, sensing that ayakashi were recently at the tree returns in the evening and runs into Kugaha. Yato demands to know whose shinki he is and they have a brief confrontation before Kugaha escapes on.",
