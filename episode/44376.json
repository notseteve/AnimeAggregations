  "description" : "Although Yamato resolves to stay on track, he just can`t seem to be able to catch the baton, repeatedly dropping it. To help Yamato, Miki decides to take matters into her own hands and train Yamato. After many hours of practice, Yamato still fails to receive the baton properly, due to Suzuka occupying his thoughts the moment of receiving the baton. Eventually, Yamato reveals that his poor performance is due to his regret of lying to Suzuka. Miki offers to talk to Suzuka about it, but Yamato declines the offer, stating that he should stop making excuses and talk to her himself. Yamato tells the truth to Suzuka and reveals how valuable her friendship is to him. Suzuka later calls him to say she is not angry anymore and encourages him to work hard at track.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
