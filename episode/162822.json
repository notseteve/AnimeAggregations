  "description" : "After Lilith`s arrival, Arata discovers that his normal, peaceful life had actually ended three days ago with the Black Sun gravitational phenomenon. He also learns that his current world was created by the grimoire that Hijiri gave him before disappearing, therefore granting his wish. After discovering that Hijiri is alive, Arata decides to become a mage in hopes of saving her. After he enters into the Royal Biblia Academy, he discovers that only those of Demon Lord class mages are able to create worlds. He also found out that in order to save Hijiri, he will need the help of the Trinity Seven.\nSource: Wikipedia",
