  "description" : "Sakura figured out how to capture the Earthy card all by herself! That meant that all the cards had been captured. Sakura is so amazing! With all the cards caught, Kero returned to his true form, and so did Yue. It turned out that Yukito was Yue all along! Yue claimed to be administering the \"Final Judgement\" and took Xiaolang up on the roof and beat him up pretty badly. And then he said that Sakura was next.\nSource: crunchyroll",
