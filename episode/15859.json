  "description" : "Apocalymon launches the \"Total Annihilation\" attack, the power within the kids causes their digivices to contain the blast and return it back at full force onto Apocalymon and with that the final battle is over. Gennai shows up and tells the kids that the DigiWorld will now start over, starting with File Island. The DigiWorld begins to return to normal and the kids go back to File Island. They decide they will stay in the DigiWorld the rest of the summer since time on Earth is so much slower than the DigiWorld. However, Gennai explains that after Apocalymon was destroyed time in the real world and the DigiWorld became equal, so now time travels at the same rate in both worlds. The only way for the kids to get home is through a portal that will close in two hours. Each of the kids must say goodbye to their Digimon partners. However, as they are leaving, T.K. and Kari somehow seem to know that they will see each other again someday. Tai says that he will never forget the digimon and wonders if they will remember him when or if they meet again!!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
