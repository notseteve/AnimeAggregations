  "description" : "For Honoka’s birthday, Yamato wants to surprise her and buy a very meaningful gift. To achieve this, he asks the residents of the inn to help him choose, but they all give really bad advice, and he ends up resorting to a magazine. Eventually, he asks Suzuka to help him choose, and she agrees. After wandering for so long, Yamato buys a necklace from a street vendor, using Suzuka as a modeling dummy. On the way back, Honoka spots Yamato with Suzuka. When Yamato presents the gift to Honoka later on, Yamato tells her that he actually went with Suzuka, and not Yasunobu, only to find that Honoka already knew. Because of her calm attitude, he takes this as a good sign, and goes into detail about how he bought it with Suzuka, and ends up getting his gift given back to him.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
