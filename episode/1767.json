  "description" : "The Nadesico finds itself in trouble when they are given a mission to take out a new Jovian weapon called a \"Walking Stick\". After the weapon`s initial offensive critically damages the Nadesico`s systems, it`s up to the Aestivalis pilots to reach the deadly weapon and destroy it before it can recharge for a second barrage. But if the pilots can figure out the true meaning of teamwork soon, it might spell the end for the Nadesico.\nSource: crunchyroll",
