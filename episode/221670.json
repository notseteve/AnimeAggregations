  "description" : "Having learned how expensive books are in this world, Myne resolves to make books of her own. However, she soon finds out just how frail her new body is when she and her elder sister, Turi, decide to go to the gate to deliver something their father forgot—she can hardly take a few steps before running out of breath. But that`s when Lutz, a neighborhood kid the same age as Myne, offers his help. Myne is touched by this and soon makes it to the gate. There, Otto gives her his old slate, letting her experience the joy of writing once again.\nSource: crunchyroll",
