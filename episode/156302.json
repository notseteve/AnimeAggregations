  "description" : "The volcano begins to erupt as Fino attempts to open the gate to the demon world and complete her transformation, and Raul and his party have to fly through a deadly rain of volcanic debris to get to her. They are attacked by harpies and other monsters as they approach. Lore is injured as their carriage is damaged, she remains behind to try to repair it with the old man as Raul, Airi, and Ram attempt to continue the rest of the way on foot. They find a cavern that leads inside the volcano and are attacked by hordes of monsters. Ram and Airi make Raul to go on ahead to face Fino as they hold back these monsters.\nRaul has a battle with Fino as he attempts to get her to return to the way she used to be, even as the gate to the demon world begins to open and her transformation is nearly complete. He manages to reach her by reminding her of the eight basic phrases he taught her when she was learning how to speak to customers, and of the order she worked so hard to fulfil just before she was abducted. This lets Fino break free from the Bloodstone`s power and return to her normal state.",
