  "description" : "With public trust in the Inquisition waning after their misdeeds were exposed in Rumble Town, there are no towns willing to provide Dragunov and his men with much-needed supplies. A rookie soldier laments how unfair it is that they`re being treated as harshly as Konrad himself, when they actualyl fought against him to protect the people. Dragunov cautions him that just because one thinks they are doing the right thing doesn`t mean they will be rewarded. Meanwhile, after what happened in Rumble Town, distribution of goods into Artemis Academy has all but stopped.\nSource: crunchyroll",
