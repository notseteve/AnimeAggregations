  "description" : "Joshua fails to recognize Rosette as his older sister, as the latter deduces that he was brainwashed by Aion. Steiner, telling Azmaria how Satella has changed in attitude, is suddenly slaughtered by Genai, who captures Azmaria. Chrono, catching up to Rosette, becomes trapped in a ring of fire, ignited by Aion`s sword, which was given by Shader. Joshua screams in pain when his horns grow, and Chrono is consequently shot to the ground. The ritual of atonement commences, wreaking havoc in the city. When Satella arrives, she is stopped by Fiore, revealed to be her older sister. Rosette is awakened after the ritual is performed. A spiral of astral lines appear in the sky, and the city begins to evacuate. Chrono hears her call out his name when Aion kisses her. By release of the seal of the soul timepiece, Chrono transform as he makes his first move. \nSource: Wikipedia",
