I`m sorry for never telling you that I`d recovered this far already!\nTo be honest, I wanted to keep it all secret until I was able to show you all that I`d fully recovered. Hey Daigo-kun! I wrote it in the letter too, right? That we`d form the ultimate battery some day? I can`t run yet, but in middle school, I`m going to join the baseball team. I promise I`ll get back up! So... Daigo-kun, you have to promise that you will never give up the baseball you love so much!\nSource: crunchyroll",
