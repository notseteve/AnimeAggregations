  "description" : "Kero sensed a Clow Card, which led him and Sakura to Tsukimine Shrine, where they were joined by Xiaolang, who also sensed the card, After searching for nearly an hour, they took a break, and Sakura got sucked into the shrine`s sacred tree! It turned out the Return card had sent Sakura back to the past, when Toya and Ms. Mizuki first met. Hidden up in the tree, Sakura overheard parts of their conversations as time jumped ahead to their meetings under the tree. But just as Sakura was about to get some clue, she found that she had returned to the present time, and was able to seal the Return card! However, it went to Xiaolang, who had used a lot of energy using the Time card to rescue Sakura.\nSource: crunchyroll",
