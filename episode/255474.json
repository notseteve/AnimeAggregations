  "description" : "One week after enrolling in Shuchiin Academy as a special scholarship student, Shirogane had already regretted that he had come to a school he should not have. The students around him were elites born into famous families. Shirogane, who is from a modest household and enrolled from a school outside of Shuchiin`s track, couldn`t even find a friend to eat with, so he quietly kills time away from the cafeteria. Just as Shirogane`s miserable emotions explode, an upperclassman with a student cap appears in front of him. A shining golden fourragere lays across his chest as proof of student council president. And he says that he`s come to recruit Shirogane into the student council.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
