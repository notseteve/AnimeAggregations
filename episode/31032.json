  "description" : "Melmo and two of her younger brothers love their mother very much, but tragedy strikes and they suddenly lose her in a traffic accident. The mother is told in heaven that only one of her wishes may be fulfilled. So, she asks that her children be allowed to grow up soon since it is too difficult for them to go on living as kids. Then, God gives her candies of two different colors. A blue candy adds ten years to a person`s age, while a red candy makes you lose the same 10 years. Appearing in front of Melmo as a ghost, her mother gives her the candies. Encouraging Melmo tenderly but firmly that she will be fine with the candies, Melmo`s mother asks Melmo to take good care of her little brothers, and leaves her.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
