  "description" : "Kaito meets a boy genius solver named Cubic Galois, who carries the title of `Edison` and prefers mathematics other puzzles. He attaches a strange bracelet onto Kaito`s arm, which causes his head to hurt whenever he thinks about puzzles. At this time, Kaito, Nonoha and Gammon are called to solve a puzzle, with the city rigged to explode if they fail. Though Cubic tries to make things harder for Kaito to make him give up on puzzles, he soon learns that the puzzle giver is serious about blowing up the city. With less than two minutes remaining, Kaito enters his Phi-Brain state and solves the puzzle with a second to spare. Admiring his skill, Cubic apologizes to Kaito and removes the bracelet.\nSource: Wikipedia",
