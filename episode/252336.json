  "description" : "In retaliation against Boruto and his friends for destroying Tenma’s mobile fortress, the pirates land on the Isle of Shipbuilders. Funamushi, a follower of the Funato Clan, attacks Kagura, hoping to capture him alive so that he can use him as a bargaining chip. Kagura fights back using the Hiramekarei—the twin swords that the Sixth Mizukage Chojuro entrusted to him—but Funamushi is a formidable foe. Meanwhile, Seiren appears before Boruto and torments him with her persistent attacks. Can Boruto find his way out of this predicament?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
