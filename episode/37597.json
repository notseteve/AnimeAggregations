  "description" : "Kaioh`s fist no longer has any effect on Kenshiro. In contrast to the North Star Lapis Lazuli Fist, whose style has already been perfected and has no further progress, the Divine Fist of the North Star is a style which continues to constantly evolve on the battlefield. Thus, by using the hidden technique Kenshiro acquired, the art to deflect the North Star Lapis Lazuli Fist, it is rendered completely ineffective. Seeing his chances of winning slipping away, Kaioh casts off the armor he wears to contain his evil fighting spiritual energy, and goes all-out in a last ditch battle! Meanwhile, Black Yaksha meets his end protecting Lin, and Hyoh is in dire peril once more! But then, some unexpected backup arrives...!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
