  "description" : "Haru, Elie, Plue, and Griff make their way toward Tremolo Mountain in search of the Rave Stone. However, they soon realize that Shuda is there as well. Plue runs off in a nearby forest, and Haru sets out to look for Plue. Haru then encounters Deerhound, a talking bear, who gives him advice upon entering Tremolo Mountain. Meanwhile, Elie took suits from a few of the Shadow Guard as a disguise for her and Haru to gain access inside Tremolo Mountain. Once inside the caves and tunnels, Haru and Elie get caught in their disguise. They quickly run for cover, but they end up in a dead end. Haru and Elie jumps off a cliff, using Griff`s ability to shape-shift to land safely. The flowers on the ground nearby emit pollen that causes them to sleep. Schneider, a doctor though really an assassin, inflames the flowers, seemingly saving them. Schneider offers to help them find the Rave Stone.\nSource: Wikipedia",
