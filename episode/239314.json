  "description" : "“Nothing is more important than singing an amazing song…that will allow me to fulfill my life’s mission.” Diva is astonished when she hears from Matsumoto that Vivy’s mission is to prevent a war between humanity and AIs. He also explains to Diva that his current aim is to stop Ophelia from taking her own life. Ophelia is a songstress AI who just finished an incredible performance during rehearsal. As a principle, AIs are forbidden from self-destruction, so Diva approaches Ophelia to prevent her from committing suicide.\nSource: Funimation",
