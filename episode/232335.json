  "description" : "Meowth has a cold, so Jessie and James decide to practice their Pikachu translation skills by watching a video of Pikachu and guessing what it says! Jessie goes first, portraying Pikachu as a snob; James offers a friendlier version. They agree that Pikachu loves them, but Meowth’s not about to reveal the truth…\nThen, Ash and Goh find a Marshtomp buried in hard, dry ground! Realizing that it had been playing in the mud when the ground dried out, our heroes decide to help as its friends look on. After some failed attempts, a Ludicolo appears; it uses Rain Dance to soften the ground…but then Marshtomp’s friends get stuck, too!\nSource: Official Website",
