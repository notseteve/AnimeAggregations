  "description" : "Kurisu reveals to Rintaro that she recalls her stabbing from dreams, as well as Rintaro`s various attempts at saving Mayuri. When Kurisu tells Rintaro that he should save Mayuri over her, he cannot accept it and runs back to the lab. As Rintaro attempts to time leap again, Kurisu stops him, worried that seeing Mayuri die over and over will destroy him. After giving in and choosing to save Mayuri, Rintaro tells Kurisu he loves her, to which she responds by kissing him. The next day, Kurisu prepares to return to America, while Rintaro and the others delete the original D-Mail from the SERN network. Just after erasing the data, Kurisu returns to the lab to tell him that she loves him, but is cut off as Rintaro shifts back to the Beta World Line. Some time after getting rid of the PhoneWave, Rintaro receives a call from an alternate Suzuha, telling him she needs his help to prevent World War III. \nSource: Wikipedia",
