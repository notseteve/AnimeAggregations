  "description" : "Keisaku comes back and awakens Margery and they confess their love to each other at last. She makes him as powerful as herself fearing that he would not survive being intimate with her. Meanwhile, at the Serei-den, Shana, Wilhelmina, Khamsin and Rebecca enter the Divine Gate to fight the Trinity and the Snake of the Festival. Outside the Gate, in a blizzard, the war is getting extremely intensive—more and more Denizen armies are coming but they are losing against the Flame Hazes. Decarabia comes to the surface and starts a powerful attack but Sophie Sawallisch finds him and kills him, using a large amount of her powers. After a moment of comfort that the most powerful enemy has been destroyed, the snow from the blizzard turns into Denizens, and the commander of the Western army Haborym arrives earlier than Sawallisch expected. Meanwhile in the Divine Gate, Sabrac stands to delay Shana`s progress.\nSource: Wiki",
