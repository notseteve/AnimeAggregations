  "description" : "The episode begins with the workers of Easter showing their plan to obtain the Embryo for Kazuomi. Amu is walking and sees Ikuto playing the violin. While Ikuto plays, Amu sings along for a little while, but then one of Ikuto`s violin strings breaks. Ikuto and Amu`s Guardian Characters tease her that her horrible voice broke the string. Ikuto takes Amu to a violin shop, and a guy fixes Ikuto`s violin. Kotone, who has a crush on Ikuto, comes out and is greeted by a customer who gives her two violins to repair, one of which being of high value. Amu stays with Kotone while she is repairing it, and after she finishes, she falls asleep and knocks over her drink. When she wakes up, a part of that drink spills on the violin, and she becomes so depressed about it that an X Egg is born and hatches. Amu purifies the X Character as Amulet Spade with Ikuto mysteriously disappearing.\nSource: crunchyroll",
