  "description" : "Kazuki disbands Isla and Tsukasa`s partnership using as pretext that workplace romances are forbidden, and Isla is once again Kazuki`s partner while Tsukasa is partnered with Constance. Kazuki explains that she is intervening because Isla seems to believe it better that things remain that way, and Kazuki has a plan to knock some sense into her.\nThe two of them go on a retrieval mission for a giftia owned by a notorious gangster who acts as his bodyguard, but now begins to care for her after she saved his life so many times. The gangster tells his giftia to enjoy the time she has left, but Isla says that in exchange he ought to join them as well, because nothing makes one happier than being with the one you love. After they leave, Kazuki tells Isla to take her own advice, and admonishes her, saying that if she leaves Tsukasa that way his last memories of her will be painful ones.\nThe next morning Isla comes into the office and finally confesses to Tsukasa that she loves him too.",
