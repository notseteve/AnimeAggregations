  "description" : "Operation Meteorite, a plan to lure Aragami with a newly developed guiding device, is critical to the completion of the Aegis Plan. Lenka is unable to join the unit due to adjustments that must be made on his God Arc, but Lindow recommends him to command the advance base camp. Alisa rejoins the unit, but the others seem to feel uncomfortable around her. Operation Meteorite starts successfully, but suddenly the Aragami turn away from the guiding devices and head northwest. Lindow is sent to do reconnaissance and realizes that the Aragami are converging on Asyl, the settlement that Lindow has been helping.\nSource: crunchyroll",
