  "description" : "The student council has asked the Supernatural Research Club to investigate incidents of first-year students embroiled in trouble, which they believe to be caused by yet another witch, Takigawa Noa, who seems to have the power to see the past of those she kisses. Yamada has difficulty reaching her at first, but she perks up immediately when the topic of the witches comes up, which makes him very suspicious. As it seems that the powers of the witches are inherited by students who are troubled in some way, Takigawa`s plan seems to be to make her friends obtain these powers by making them similarly troubled and removing the present set of witches.\nTakigawa`s group attempts to get Shiraishi expelled by using her body swap powers against her and causing trouble while in her body, but the Club is one step ahead. Takigawa`s friend winds up swapping bodies with Yamada in Shiraishi`s body, who overpowers her companions. After they negotiate with Takigawa to release her friends, Yamada confronts her and he finds her power is to see traumatic events in the past of a person she kisses. He learns that her friends were framed for the troubles they found themselves in, and were disgraced as a result. Ultimately he convinces her to stop with her plans as he promises to help them to regain their original status.",
