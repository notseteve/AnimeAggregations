  "description" : "Court lady An Huilan comes to make a request. She claims she can hear the voice of a dead consort coming from within the water. Xi Wanlin, the Magpie Consort during Yandi`s reign, drowned herself in the lake on the day the emperor was to visit her. The voice within the water is allegedly hers. Huilan asks Shouxue to save Wanlin, but Shouxue realizes there is more to the story than what Huilan is telling her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
