  "description" : "Kinji takes Aria, unconscious from the shot, and treats her so that she revives. He undoes her blouse and kisses her; his arousal at this activates his Hysteria Mode. When Riko gets to them he is prepared, and they manage to chase her off. The plane lurches as this happens, making them realise that it probably has no pilot, so Aria, who knows how to fly planes, goes to the cockpit, while Kinji goes after Riko. He finds her as she is preparing to make her getaway, mysteriously mentioning an organisation called EU whom she works for, and implying they have his brother. She manages to escape, and Aria and Kinji must get the plane to land safely, damaged as it is by Riko`s compatriots, who have fired missiles on it just as she escaped. They manage this despite the JSDF threatening to shoot the plane down if they disobey their instructions to essentially crash the plane into the sea.\nAfterwards, Aria realises she really needs a partner and there could be no other partner for her but Kinji. At the last minute Kinji changes his mind and chases after her.",
