  "description" : "Taiki`s team arrives at the Disc Zone, a land built of many layers of giant light discs. There they find Kiriha, who has obtained the Zone`s Code Crown, in a fierce battle with Blastmon of the Bagra Army. However, the Disc Zone is ancient and its land weak, meaning if their intense battle continues, the whole Zone will collapse. Taiki and Shoutmon X4K try to stop the fighting, but just then, the ground beneath them caves in! Blastmon, Shoutmon, Greymon, and MailBirdramon fall in, leaving their respective teams without their central fighting force as the Bagra Army sends a powerful new enemy, Bulbmon, into the battle!\nSource: crunchyroll",
