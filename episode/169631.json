  "description" : "To progress in their quest the heroines need the key to the Kingdom of Geldabar, which is held by the mayor, who asks them to do what he says. Only the Fighter agrees, and he has her doing all kinds of ridiculous things, from hauling goods around town, searching for stray dogs, drinking a strange potion that makes her molest the Paladin, and killing a tentacle monster. After fulfilling the last of the mayor`s requests he tells her that the key is already within her and that she has learned the virtues of a hero and more platitudes in a similar vein. This angers her so much that she beats up the mayor.",
