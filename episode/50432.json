  "description" : "Peorth continues to hang out at the temple, meddling more and more in Keiichi`s life. She belittles Belldandy`s ability to fulfill Keiichi`s wish, and angers the other goddesses to the point where they issue a contest to fulfill Keiichi`s wishes, however simple or unintentionally perverted they might be. Then Peorth attempts to make her own version of the Love Potion by using one of Urd`s ingredients, but that could result in some big time trouble for Keiichi.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
