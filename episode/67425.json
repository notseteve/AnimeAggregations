  "description" : "Ikkaku and the Arrancar, Edrad, have a fierce battle in the streets of Karakura Town. Yumichika stands aside and watches because he knows that Ikkaku will be furious if he interferes. Edrad dodges Ikkaku`s wild attacks and coldly analyzes his fighting style. He determines that Ikkaku will not admit defeat unless he shows him an overpoweringly greater strength. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Rukia defeat D Roy, and take on Grimmjow, who`s spiritual pressure is like nothing they`ve ever seen.\nSource: crunchyroll",
