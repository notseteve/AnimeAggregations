  "description" : "In a room where an ancient clock ticks away the time, Taikobo sits facing Ohtenkun, who asks him what his choice will be. Ohtenkun`s question leads Taikobo on a journey through his own memories... and each of those memories is linked to Ohtenkun`s. Yozen, Supushan, the Buseioh, and all the others Taikobo has met face him in turn. Eventually, after a span of time in which past, present, and future seem to intermingle, the mysteries of the Hoshin Project`s history come unraveled.\nSource: crunchyroll",
