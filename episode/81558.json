  "description" : "Katsura is reporting the shogunate`s recent activities at a salon where Joi faction members gather. But the faction members are only interested in talking about the latest popular drama and don`t listen to what he says. Katsura becomes angry and leaves the salon. He proceeds to a video rental store. When he tries to rent a video, the store employee asks him to show his driver`s license as identification, but as a fugitive, he doesn`t have a license. Meanwhile, Gintoki has gone to a driving school to take lessons after having his license suspended. When he gets into a passenger seat as part of a joint exercise with the other students, he finds Katsura in the driver`s seat!\nSource: crunchyroll",
