  "description" : "The Magikarp high jump competition is here, and Goh and his Magikarp want to beat Kasukarp and his partner, Shinegoldie! After some intense training, Goh’s Magikarp leaves Shinegoldie in its wake—but it jumps so high that it enters the stratosphere and doesn’t come back, leaving it disqualified.\nThen, our heroes visit Slowpoke Island, where they meet lots of Slowpoke and a Slowking! Goh wants to catch Slowking, but the Shellder on its head comes off, and one by one, our heroes find it on top of their heads, resulting in some strange behavior! When the chaos clears, the Shellder ends up back on Slowking’s head—along with Goh’s Magikarp!\nSource: Official Website",
