  "description" : "Satsuki announces her new Naturals Election scheme where students must survive a seven-day battle royal to earn Goku Uniforms. Meanwhile, Ryuko takes Mako to the ruins of her old house, where she shares about the circumstances surrounding her father`s death. Finding no further clues, Ryuko and Mako head home, but their scooter runs out of gas. Ira drives them to the gas station, but during their ride, they are attacked by the automotive and airsoft clubs. Ira absorbs the hits, which power up his uniform, and lays waste to his opponents. The next week, Satsuki has Honnouji`s remaining contenders scramble onto pillars in a king of the hill game, but Ryuko and the Elite Four easily secure their positions. There, Satsuki declares that Ryuko must defeat each of the Elite Four in exchange for details concerning her father`s death, with her first opponent being Ira.",
