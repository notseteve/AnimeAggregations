  "description" : "The students of the Misfit Class have been given a special order. The order was for all of them to reach the Dalet rank before they become second-years, or they would lose the Royal One that they had worked so hard to obtain. The next event where they can raise their rank is the Harvest Festival. In order to help them raise their ranks in such a short amount of time, the school had prepared special tutors for them. The new term had only just begun, but unexpected trials await Iruma and his friends.\nSource: crunchyroll",
