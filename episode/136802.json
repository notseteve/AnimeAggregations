  "description" : "As Kaito experiences strange occurances in which he loses focus of everything else when he glances at puzzles, Cubic reveals this is the result of Kaito`s brain speed reaching abnormal levels, advising him not to solve puzzles anymore. As Kaito ignores his advice and prepares to face another Fool`s Puzzle, Cubic asks for Souji`s help in hacking into POG`s network. Although Kaito is able to quickly solve the puzzle, he remains unable to see anything, but Nonoha arrives and helps him return to normal. As Cubic and Souji successfully hack into the POG network, Baron follows Rook to where Jin is held captive.",
