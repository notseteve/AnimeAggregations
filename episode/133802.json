  "description" : "Yuji and Shana finally meet as Margery and Wilhelmina come to see what is happening. Yuji reveals that he is indeed himself but also The Snake of Festival and that he has come to save Shana from her inevitable fate as a Flame Haze—to fight against Denizens until she burns out. Shana does not believe him and the three Flame Hazes fight with Yuji. He traps Wilhelmina and Margery in a ball of silver. Yuji explains to Margery that the Silver is a projection of her emotions. He is a mirror of her hate towards everyone who abused her and has done the things Margery secretly wanted to do to them on her behalf. She has a mental breakdown and starts hysterically crying. Meanwhile, Yuji is chasing Shana and they fight. In the end, he captures her and goes to the Haridan with Shana unconscious in his arms. He takes the Haridan and claims it is his property. Yuji reveals to Yoshida, after she asks him, that he returned her letter back to let her know he chose Shana. She then falls on her knees in shock. Yuji flies to the Serei-den with Shana in his arms.\nSource: Wikipedia",
