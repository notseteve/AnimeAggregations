  "description" : "\"`Follow your heart,` was it? That`s how I want to live too.\"\nWhile Shou still loves classical music from the bottom of his heart, he also wants to explore new sounds and experience new relationships. When Shou explains that to Haruto, Haruto decides to invite Ejima out for drinks to convince him to attend Shou`s concert. In their conversation, Ejima says that he still adores Shou`s violin playing, but he also has doubts about Shou performing as an idol. Haruto is afraid that Ejima doesn`t understand Shou`s commitment to music. Ejima explains his own passion for music and his deep respect for Shou`s violin playing. Haruto, disappointed that he never felt passion like that in his life, hangs on Ejima`s every word.\nSource: crunchyroll",
