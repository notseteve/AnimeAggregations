  "description" : "Akari is taking customers out for a tour!  Alicia is along to help, of course, and it`s a good thing she`s there.  When the tourists start asking questions that Akari doesn`t know the answers to, Alicia answers them with ease... but this worries Akari.  Will she ever know the city as well as Alicia?  This sparks a fire in Aika and Alice as well - they`ve decided to compete to see which one of them knows the most hidden wonders in Neo-Venezia.\nSource: crunchyroll",
