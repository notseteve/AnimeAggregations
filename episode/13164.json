  "description" : "Although Shiryu has lost his sight, he accepts the challenge of Ohko, who had also been a disciple of the Rooshi when they were both children, but who had been expelled. As he prepares to fight Ohko, Rooshi tells him that he will probably lose as long as he does not know the true purpose of his fighting.. Shiryu doesn’t understand this, but as he is warding off blows given by Ohko, Shiryu suddenly realizes the true purpose is to protect this world in which his friends live. \nWith this realization, his cosmo-energy suddenly grows and he is able to defeat Ohko.\nSource: crunchyroll",
