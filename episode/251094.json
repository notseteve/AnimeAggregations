One night after a mixer, an entity calling itself a goddess sends them to another world. When Jinguuji opens his eyes, he sees Tachibana, who`s been transformed into a beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde girl. Now that the two are of different genders from each other, they`re each bewildered by the other`s charms. They steel their determination to defeat the Demon Lord in order to return to who they were with their relationship still intact.\nSource: crunchyroll",
