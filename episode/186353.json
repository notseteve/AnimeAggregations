  "description" : "Sakuragi Hinako is a girl who freezes up like a scarecrow when in front of people. Because animals love her, she often worked as an actual scarecrow at her old home in the country, but now she`s she decided to attend Fujimiya High School, which has a theater club she wants to join, in hopes of getting better at talking to people. So she left the countryside to move into Hitotose Manor in Tokyo, where she met its unusual but lovable residents, Kuina and Mayuki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
