During their time together, Shirayuki learns why her father left her in the care of her grandparents and his history, including the reason why Kazuki had taken her. Shirayuki speaks with a guilt-ridden Obi and assures him that despite what happened, she doesn`t blame him. Meanwhile, Zen and Mukaze have a private talk regarding Zen and Shirayuki`s relationship, where Zen admits their love for each other and receives Mukaze`s blessing. Later, Shirayuki and Zen spend time alone together since being reunited. Eventually everyone soon returns to Tanbarun, where they reunite with Raji and attend a special ball in honour of Shirayuki`s safe return. The next day, Shirayuki and the others say their goodbyes and begin their journey to return to Clarines. \nSource: Wikipedia",
