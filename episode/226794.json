  "description" : "Snowy weather forces Professor Cerise to temporarily close the lab for repairs, so he asks Ash and Goh to return to their homes in the meantime. Goh is happy to see his grandma again, but his parents are busy working elsewhere, so he decides to go meet up with them. Walking through a park, he encounters a Cubone being teased by a trio of Mankey. The Mankey steal Cubone’s bone, and the poor little Pokémon’s despair prompts Goh to help. Ash eventually arrives, and with some help from their Pokémon, our heroes successfully return the bone. The formerly lonely Cubone is so thankful, it insists on joining Goh’s team!\nSource: Official Website",
