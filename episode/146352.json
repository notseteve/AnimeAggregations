  "description" : "Kidou Eita, abandoned by his parents after their divorce, has a rather cynical attitude towards love and relationships, much to the frustration of his childhood friend Harusaki Chiwa, and prioritises his studies above all, so he can get a scholarship to medical school and become a doctor. An incredibly beautiful girl named Natsukawa Masuzu transfers into his class after living overseas for nine years. One day, Masuzu suddenly asks him to walk home with her after declaring that she`s in love with him. He agrees to do so reluctantly, and eventually she says that so many other boys have confessed their love for her since she transferred and she wants it to stop, so she chose Eita to be her fake boyfriend. He is initially reluctant, but after she suddenly produces his old notebook full of his embarrassing chuunibyou fantasies and blackmails him with its contents he grudgingly agrees to her proposal.",
