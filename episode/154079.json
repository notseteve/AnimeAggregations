  "description" : "Yui accidentally displeases teddy bear-holding Kanato by incorrectly guessing what he wants from her, and he punishes her for her lack of comprehension skills by displacing her school bag, which in turn causes her to displease Raito by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Raito proceeds to punish her using decidedly less childish methods, and mocks her for believing in something that can`t physically save her from the evil that is him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
