  "description" : "One Sunday, Sakura`s turn came to clean her house. While the rest of her family was out for the day, she came across the Wood card, along with another card whose name was covered by an ink stain! She soon discovered that Wood was working on its magic on the house, and it began turning into a miniature rainforest! Soon after that, she realized that Wood wasn`t working alone- as it turned out, the mystery card she found before was the Rain card! And because of all the rain, Wood was growing out of control. But with the help of Watery, Sakura managed to snag both Wood and Rain together. With that, her work as Cardcaptor was done for the day- but her housework was far from over!\nSource: crunchyroll",
