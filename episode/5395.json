  "description" : "Rumors are circulating that a weapons dealer will be using Tony, a Humaritt, to steal one of the exhibits at a weapons fair. Najica and Lila are sent to apprehend her, preferably before she steals the weapon. \nUnfortunately, they have no idea what Tony looks like or what weapon she`s after, so the two secret agents must wait for Tony to make her move. And when she does, will Najica and Lila be fast enough to stop Tony before any innocent bystanders get hurt?",
