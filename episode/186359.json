  "description" : "Guri finally meets Seiji`s younger sister, Akua and is surprised by her rather cold attitude towards her big brother. The cupid decides to learn more about what changed this once loving sister, and Yuzu is right there to help (or make things worse...). But while the girls are getting acquainted the demon Stolas appears and a panick ensues! The strangely psychotic penguin seems to have a special affinity for Akua and sends her running. It`s up to her big brother Seiji to save her like he used to.\nSource: crunchyroll",
