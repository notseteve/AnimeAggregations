  "description" : "The airplane Melmo and Prof. Waregarasu were fleeing on crash lands on a desert island. The pilot shoots a rabbit with a rifle to secure some food. But Melmo and the party immediately find themselves surrounded by all the animals living on the island. Looking closely at the animals, they realize that there is a pair of each kind. The male rabbit is alone because his partner has been killed. Melmo and the party apologize to the animals. Deeply sympathetic with the male rabbit, Melmo takes red and blue candies at the same time, transforms herself into a rabbit, and comforts the male rabbit.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
