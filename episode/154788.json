  "description" : "Seidou High School faces off against Ichidai Third High School, the school that beat them last year. While their top-level offense rakes in runs, the ace Tanba isn`t doing too hot. The game turns into a batting game. On the other hand, Sawamura is back at school, training by himself. During his training, Furuya, another first-year pitcher approaches him. Showing sympathy to Sawamura`s peculiar training method, Furuya offers to play catch with him. Sawamura is in a cheery mood with Furuya`s kindness, but the speed of Furuya`s throws far exceeds his expectations.\nSource: crunchyroll",
