  "description" : "Character popularity results are announced to celebrate Gintama’s 182nd episode!  Shinpachi is alone at the café, feeling depressed after learning that he’s still in 8th place in popularity, unchanged from the previous ranking. Yamazaki, who is in 9th place, drops by to say that boring characters such as they should aim to become the No. 1 steppingstone for others. For Shinpachi and Yamazaki, 8th and 9th place should hold the same meaning as 1st. But in reality Yamazaki can’t give up the hope of ranking higher, and runs off in tears. Shinpachi can do nothing but watch, when suddenly Yamazaki’s scream is heard in the distance!\nSource: crunchyroll",
