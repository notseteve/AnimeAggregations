  "description" : "Things turn awkward the next day, but they try to put it behind them. More complications arrive when Manami, Tetsurou`s married sister, takes a homebound Kaito for shopping. Ichika sees them, and followed them via teleportation with Rinon`s help, even at her place. Worried about what will happen next, Ichika enters and tries to take him home...though not without clashing a bit with Manami, acting like an overprotective lover, until Tetsurou comes to clear things up, that Manami is already married, and she`s here because of a petty quarrel with her husband. As an apology Ichika asked Kaito for a favor from him. He asked if she could help him review for the finals, to which she agreed, and helped him study until the final day of exams.\nSource: Wiki",
