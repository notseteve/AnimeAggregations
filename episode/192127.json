  "description" : "The evil trio head to Japan in 1605 to find Tokugawa Ieyasu, who brought peace to the land after winning in the Battle of Sekigahara. They manage to find him, but apparently Tokugawa was having trouble deciding on the next shogun. Apparently the heir he has in mind, Hidetada, isn’t very reliable and is not respected by those who serve him. Then Tokio and Calen show up and Ieyasu proposes a hunting match with Hidetada. He actually wanted to let Hidetada win so everyone would respect him more and he devises a plan with Tokio and the others.\nSource: crunchyroll",
