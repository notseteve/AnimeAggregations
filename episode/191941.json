  "description" : "\"I probably wounded them deeply.\"\nGrowth and ZIX, a two-man unit from another agency, have been closely connected since before their debut. Treated as two rival groups, they`ve been appearing together more and more often. Since Sakuraba Ryota hates to lose, his competitive spirit burns particularly hot every time they work together. Their leader Eto Koki watches over Ryota, sometimes rebuking him, but since he dislikes conflict, each passing day pains him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
