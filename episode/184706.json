  "description" : "As eras change, one thing remains rock solid. To Yotaro, that`s Yakumo. After being inspired by the \"Shinigami\" he heard from him in prison, he decided he`d follow him anywhere. Those straightforward words lead Yakumo to talk about rakugo and his own death. Yotaro insists that if he wants to die in the theater, he needs to do rakugo again, and invites him to perform at the prison with him. Though Yakumo hesitates at first, he eventually decides to try doing rakugo for the sake of others.\nSource: crunchyroll",
