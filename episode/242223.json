  "description" : "During the Bloody Halloween, Mikey ended up in a 1v3 fight against Kagetora with his limbs bound. After Kazutora hits him in the head with a pipe, Mikey ends up on his knees. The Valhalla members see this as a chance to finish off the Invincible Mikey and try to get to him. Draken and Takemichi try to save Mikey, but they`re too far away. But then, a rather surprising person came to Mikey`s aid.\nSource: crunchyroll",
