He gazes at her up on stage from the audience. \nThe lyrics of her debut song, \"White Album\" bring out memories of all the times the two shared.\nSaying to herself, \"It isn`t over yet,\" finishes her climactic concert at Club Calma. Immediately, without even stopping to rest, she dashes off. But to where...? Backstage, after the concert, Touya gets a rather large gift from Yuki. Before parting ways, Yuki whispers to him, \"I love you.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
