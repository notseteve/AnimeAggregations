Undefeated Matsutaro`s championship is riding on it, but he`s up against Kondo, another undefeated wrestler. Matsutaro has more horse power than Kondo, but Kondo is an all-around master technician. They don`t like each other either. But come what may, it`s time for a showdown.\nSource: crunchyroll",
