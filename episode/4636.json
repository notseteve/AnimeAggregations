  "description" : "At Mt. Ho, Yoko hears stories of Tai Kingdom’s Kirin who grew up in Horai(Japan) as a Taika like her.  Taiki’s Ranka was caught in the Shoku and flowed down to Horai, then Taiki came back to Mt. Ho 10 years later.  Because he had felt that he didn’t belong in his family in Japan, he accepted his destiny as a Kirin to choose a king.  Lady Priests who take care of Taiki are worried that Taiki still cannot transform into Kirin’s original beast shape, and that bothers Taiki.  Then he gets kidnapped.\nSource: crunchyroll",
