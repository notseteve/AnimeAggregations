Sakamoto is looking for a young man named Seimei who has the ability to travel through time like the chronometer. Takasugi vehemently disagrees with Sakamoto when he speaks passionately about his plan to use Seimei`s power to go back in time and make a new age for Japan. Takasugi storms out of the inn after his clash of opinions with Sakamoto, and recalls a conversation he had with the Sakamoto he knew in Nagasaki. Meanwhile, as Sakamoto and Izo are going around Kyoto making inquiries, the sought after Seimei suddenly runs into them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
