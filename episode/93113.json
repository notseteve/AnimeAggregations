  "description" : "Tsuna and the others manage to break into Merone Base. They slip past countless sensors, and come across a stupid-looking man. The man thinks that Tsuna and the others are average citizens who have wandered in. But despite that, he points his cannon-like weapon at them anyway! The man becomes angered that his attack is easily dodged, and attacks with a giant spear he takes out from his box. The man is the Dendro Chirum. He is nicknamed \"All`attacco\" which means he`s the top lance. His thrust is the strongest among the Millefiore lancers.\nSource: crunchyroll",
