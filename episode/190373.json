  "description" : "In this episode the girls have come to the Prakamiya Family (short for \"property of the Takamiya Family\") Botanical Garden. As you`d expect from a botanical garden owned by the Takamiya Family, it`s filled with strange plants, the likes of which they`ve never seen, that offer plenty of opportunity for jokes. But this is the final episode, so they`ll do their best to wrap things up neatly.\nSource: crunchyroll",
