  "description" : "After subjugating Starck, Waldlind barely pauses before invading Altirk. Villar joins forces with neighboring domains Kilhis, Regalia, and Haman to repulse Waldlind, but then a new enemy arrives from the seas. It`s Milza Kuches, price of Dartania, who once looked up to Villar. Milza has forsaken Villar, instead becoming Marrine`s sword. And with the Dartanian fleet in tow, he`s about to unleash a furious assault on Altirk.\nSource: crunchyroll",
