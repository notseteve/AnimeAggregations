  "description" : "After making contact with Mitsuhiro, the enemy core plots to win over the commander who seized Australia`s habitable zone, and the commander is actually influenced by the core`s words. On Tatsumiyajima, Miwa is once again attempting to communicate with Altair, but it isn`t going well. Later, as the final battle draws near, a long-planned coming-of-age ceremony is held for Kazuki, Soushi, Maya, Kenji, Sakura, and Kouyou, in which Fumihiko grants them official status as Alvis personnel.\nSource: crunchyroll",
