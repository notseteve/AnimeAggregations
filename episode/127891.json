  "description" : "Mom and the family are going north in a rental car.  They take a break to play in the snow, but suddenly catch sight of the figure of a furry animal.  Next to them is a \"Watch out for Bears\" sign. They panic and return to the car, but it`s not starting and won`t move...; Mom and the family are at the home of the owner of the St. Bernard, Mr. Furusawa.  Dad says that every house in Hokkaido is guaranteed to have a bear in it...; Mom and the gang have gone skiing.  Bunji gets really good in a short time, but he gets over confident, goes off on his own, and falls off a cliff, getting separated from everyone; As they approach the end of an enjoyable trip, they arrive at Cape Soya. If you weigh yourself there, you will find you weigh far more than in Tokyo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
