  "description" : "Code worships Isshiki Otsutsuki, who was defeated by Boruto and his friends. In order to meet a certain person, he visits the facility that formerly belonged to Boro. Like Kawaki, Code miraculously survived the experiments intended to help select a vessel for Isshiki—and he possesses greater power than even Jigen. He has vowed revenge against Boruto and Kawaki for destroying Isshiki.\nMeanwhile, Claw Marks left by Code are discovered just outside of the Hidden Leaf Village. While the Hokage and the others take precautions, Boruto proposes an idea to Kawaki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
