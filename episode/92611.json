  "description" : "The Guardians are in a meeting, discussing the Embryo. It then shows Easter looking through pictures of Heart`s Eggs, eventually finding a picture of the Embryo. Yaya comes across some younger students, and a girl in that group asks if Yaya could find her bird. After begging from both the group and the rest of the Guardians, Yaya decides to help. After a day of searching, she is unable to find it, but sees a television program and decides to dress up as a detective. On the second day, she finds a bird and catches it by putting it to sleep via Merry Merry. Unfortunately, this was not the bird she was looking for. However, later that day when she goes back to the classroom, she sees the bird in the cage, and Kukai tells the Guardians that the kids found it on their own.\nSource: crunchyroll",
