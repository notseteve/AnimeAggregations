  "description" : "Sparkle meets Omar, and she starts to like him mostly because Howdy says Omar lives like a prince. Sparkle misses the part about the \"lives like\" and thought he was actually a prince. She noticed that Omar was different from the Ham-Hams, because he is more charming. The Ham-Hams tell her that he travels around the world. But Sparkle actually wants to become a princess and travel. She daydreams about their marriage. However Sparkle doesn`t like Omar at the end of the episode, because when they actually traveled together (Sparkle stopped being a star just to be with Omar and become a princess), their adventure consisted of going to hot and cold places, and snake and shark infested places. Sparkle decides to stick to being a star. At the end of the episode it`s revealed Omar didn`t even have feelings for Sparkle. \nSource: Wikipedia",
