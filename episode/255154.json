  "description" : "Shikimori-san is at the mall to buy an outfit for the first date she and Izumi-kun have had in a long time. For some reason, her older brother, who still treats her like a child, is at the mall with her. Her brother is actually quite shy around people he`s never met, and before he knows it, he`s surrounded by young women and unsure what to do. Shikimori-san takes him by the hand and leads him away, which reminds her of how she always used to be the one dragged around by her brother`s hand.... and of the days when she didn`t know what she wanted to do with her life.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
