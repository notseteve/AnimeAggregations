  "description" : "Rancho, a message carrying bird, comes to Rakushun at his college campus in En.  It was a message from Yoko, now a new queen of Kei.  She tells him that she found out Asano could be alive, and that she visited Rakushun’s mother in Ko, and also invites him to her enthronement.  Rakushun sends the bird back to Yoko.  They say to each other they’re doing fine, but they both know that’s not true.  They’re both having a hard time fitting in their new environments.  Yoko sets the name of Kei’s new era Seki-Raku, Seki from Yoko “Sekishi”, Raku from “Rakushun.”\nSource: crunchyroll",
