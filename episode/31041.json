  "description" : "Because Totoo was originally a human, he has a navel even though he is now a frog. Finding out that a frog with a navel is living on a Southern island, Melmo and the party head there. On the island, a masked woman is giving villagers pollen as a medicine to make them regain their youth. Prof. Waregarasu, who accompanies the party, sees that the pollen contains narcotics. The navel of a frog is proven to be a stomach wart caused by narcotics. Melmo and the party decide to stick stamens to the pistil of a giant flower blooming on the top of the mountain. If they succeed in fertilizing to the seed, the flower will wither. \nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
