  "description" : "Halkara has built a new Nutri-Spirit factory in a nearby town and is now regularly going there from the cottage in the highlands, but she comes home exhausted every evening. It seems rumors have spread saying there`s a ghost showing up at the factory, so she`s had to do all the work alone since all the locals are scared to go there. Azusa doesn`t deal well with ghosts at all, but she can`t bear to let Halkara work herself to exhaustion, so she summons Beelzebub to help and heads to the factory late at night.\nSource: crunchyroll",
