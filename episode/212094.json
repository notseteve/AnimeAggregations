  "description" : "Hyakkimaru has regained his sense of hearing, but the increased sensory input leaves him confused to the point where even low-level ghouls can injure him. A woman`s song reaches out to him and draws Hyakkimaru. She tends his wounds at a nearby ruin where she runs an orphanage, of sorts, for children left destitute by war. What price must she pay for their continuing care?",
