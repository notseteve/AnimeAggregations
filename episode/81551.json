There are four small clips, each introduced in a comical fashion, essentially mocking the American censorship.\nThe first clip is from the original 1995 dub and shows Goku catching the fish with his digital undies! \"From the 1st episode `Bulma and Son Goku` Underwear was put on.\"\nThe second clip is from the 2001 dub and shows Goku diving after Oolong in his digital undies, as well as the \"fish full of dollars\" scene! \"From the 5th episode `The Strong Villain of the Desert, Yamcha` The underwear becomes a roll of bills!\"\nThe third clip is from the 2001 dub and shows Goku and Chi Chi are flying on Kinto-Un. Chi Chi seemingly throws Goku off the cloud for no apparent reason... \"From the 7th episode `Gyuumao of Mount Frypan` Goku does not do pat-pat...\"\nThe final clip is from the 1995 dub, and shows the scene where Chi Chi throws her helmet-knife-thingy at Kame-sennin, and he shows her his license to prove that he`s a real hermit. \"From the 8th episode `Kame-sennin`s Kamehameha` Kame-sennin`s license\"\nSource: Kanzenshuu",
