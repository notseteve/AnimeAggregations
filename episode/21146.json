  "description" : "A greedy village headman is possessed by the monster Donburibara. It makes the village headman eat as much cereal as possible, and enters his body from the navel to siphon off all nourishment. So the village headman tries to eat up all the cereals in the village, because he does not get full no matter how much he eats. Dororo and Hyakkimaru, who are passing by the village, destroy the monster. It turns out to be the spirit of a turtle in the marsh. The great turtle was too old to eat, so it sent out its spirit in the form of a monster that feeds on others` nourishment.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
