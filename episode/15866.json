  "description" : "While at summer camp, seven kids, Tai, Matt, Sora, Izzy, Mimi, Joe, and T.K.,  come across seven Digivices and are transported to a strange \"Digital World\". In this new world they make friends with little creatures that call themselves \"Digimon\"—short for Digital Monsters—who claim to be the children’s chosen partners. The seven \"Digimon\" prove to the kids that they are who they say they are when they digivolve—get much bigger, evolving into a different Digital Monster—and fight as a team to defeat a large, red beetle-like Digimon named Kuwagamon.\nSource: crunchyroll",
