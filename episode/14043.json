  "description" : "Father Remington is held captive at the Grand Central Station by Rizelle, a sinner under Aion. Rosette, who receives a call from him, is unaware of the situation. After unloading some packages, she leaves Chrono and Azmaria at the convent, making her way to the train station. Rizelle is revealed to be a spider demon, being able to control her victims as puppets with her spiderwebs. Rosette confronts Rizelle after hearing what latter said about Joshua, which convinces a desperate Rosette to board a train to see Joshua. Father Remington pleads for her to reconsider, but Rizelle subdues him. Rosette frees Father Remington from the spiderwebs, as the two make their escape from the victims. Chrono and Azmaria arrive to tranquilize the victims, causing a hesitant Rizelle to fall back, who reminds Rosette that Joshua is waiting to see her. \nSource: Wikipedia",
