  "description" : "Kagura has snuck onto a suspicious ship where she fights Takasugi under the bright moonlight. Kagura senses an odd presence and is attacked from behind. She escapes Matako Kijima’s double pistols, but Henpeita Takechi is waiting for her with the ronin he leads. Kagura wreaks havoc, but in the confusion of battle, Matako hits her with a gunshot. Even though her shoulder and leg have been injured, Kagura fights on. Finally, she gets within the ship.\nSource: crunchyroll",
