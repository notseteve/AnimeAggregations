  "description" : "Lawrence sets off to Ramtra with Nora, Holo, and Liebert, a Remerio businessman, to smuggle gold. Halfway through the forest, they are attacked by wolves, but Nora keeps them at bay. Upon arrival at Ramtra, Liebert retrieves a bag full of gold and the group begin their return trip. In the forest, they are surrounded by wolves again, this time led by a young wolf deity. Lawrence tells Nora and Liebert to go ahead. After they leave, Lawrence reluctantly departs as well to let Holo deal with the wolves. He waits for her near the edge of the forest but is attacked, tied up, and left for the wolves by three men from the Remerio Company, who hope to keep all of the profits from the smuggling for themselves.\nSource: Wikipedia",
