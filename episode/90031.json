  "description" : "Lala and all of this marriage stuff are driving Rito insane! At least he can catch a few hours of sanity alone at school.  What?!?! Lala is the new transfer student?! Even though Rito implores her to keep a low profile, her antics are making her rather popular.  Even worse, Haruna has just said that she thinks Rito and Lala make a good couple! In an attempt to cheer up Rito and teach Lala more about earth culture, Mikan decides they should go on a tour of the city.  Disaster is narrowly averted following a literal wardrobe malfunction and Lala`s inventions at the aquarium.  Oh, and Haruna ends up joining them on their outing which could be the beginning of a love triangle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
