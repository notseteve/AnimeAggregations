  "description" : "Fearing she might lose to the Saiark yet again, Hime decides to escape with Megumi to her hideout. There, Blue explains how the Phantom Empire emerged from a sealed box known as Axia and began plaguing the world with Saiark, including Hime`s homeland, the Blue Sky Kingdom. Hime, feeling she has no chance of winning against the Saiark and is a failure as a Pretty Cure, runs off, prompting Megumi and Ribbon to chase after her. Using special items called PreCards to don a magical detective outfit, Megumi, aided by her friend Yuko Omori who had ran into Hime earlier, manages to find Hime and give her some encouragement. Deciding to name themselves the HappinessCharge Precure, Megumi and Hime appear before Namakeruda once again, fighting past his army of Choiark henchmen before confronting the Hat Saiark again. With Megumi`s assistance and encouragement, Hime manages to purify the Saiark and free Mao from her imprisonment. After Mao`s feelings are then converted by Ribbon into more PreCards, Megumi and Hime promise to keep helping each other out from now on.\nNote: Cure Dream celebrates the 10th anniversary.",
