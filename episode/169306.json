  "description" : "After the battle, Lenka is imprisoned for insubordination in a military stockade, awaiting a formal court martial. He does not remember much of the battle after a very large Aragami they called Vajra appeared and attacked him. Rindou comes by to visit him and tells him some details of the battle that occurred after he lost consciousness, of how Eric, the God Eater Lenka was trying to save, sacrificed himself near the end of the battle, preventing an Aragami from killing Lenka.\nMeanwhile, Fenrir is sending another New Type God Eater named Alisa from the Russia branch to the Far East Branch as part of their overall strategy. The squadron of planes escorting her are attacked by airborne Aragami just as she approaches the base. Most of Rindou`s squad-mates are off on other missions, so he convinces Tsubaki to let him take Lenka on this mission.",
