  "description" : "Komachi-kun feels out of place looking at women`s underwear in the Underwear Society and gets fed up with his classmate`s mockery of the \"Bra-Panties Club.\" Even though she does not understand the male mind, Nayu tries to think of ways to make Komachi more comfortable participating in the Underwear Society. Out of the blue, Nayu finds a love letter in her shoe box. Upon hearing the news from Kiyono, Komachi begins to think of Nayu not as a rival, but as a girl. However, irritated by her shameless attitude towards underwear, Komachi storms out of the Underwear Society.\nSource: crunchyroll",
