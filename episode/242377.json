  "description" : "The physically powerful Noela accidentally breaks all of Kirio Drugstore`s knives. She`s scolded by Reiji, and together they go to the tool shop to do some shopping. However, for some reason it`s dark and quiet inside the tool shop. Reiji experimentally calls out in a loud voice, and a blue-haired and bespectacled Paula finally lazily responds. Apparently she fell asleep on the floor because she`s so busy. Reiji decides he`ll try to do something to help Paula, who is overwhelmed with requests from the Red Cat Brigade and other townsfolk.\nSource: crunchyroll",
