  "description" : "Yamada attempts to get Miyamura to help him see Shiraishi, who is trapped in Asuka`s body and is prevented from coming to school. His sister Leona asks to see him, and she asks him to tell her his story. Yamada, Odagiri, and Tamaki later meet with Saionji, who tells them the side effects of her powers: no one but Yamazaki knows about her and she has been so lonely as a result. Yamada points out that now the three of them also know about her, and if she continues helping Yamazaki it will be back to just the two of them. She agrees to help on the condition that they bring Leona to school. She agrees to go, after telling them how she was part of the original Supernatural Research Club with Yamazaki. and how Saionji removed his memories, making him forget all about her.\nYamada finally reaches Shiraishi who is in Asuka`s body and brings her to school and returns her to her own body. Leona and Yamazaki meet again, and he finds that though he doesn`t remember her, his feelings for her were not erased. They perform the ritual, and Yamada wishes that the witch powers vanish from the school, knowing how these powers have all largely brought the witches sadness.\nIn a private moment, Yamada finally gets to confess his love for Shiraishi, and the two of them kiss. They don`t swap bodies any more.",
