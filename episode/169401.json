  "description" : "A slime monster has invaded the house, and leaves everyone frantic after she nearly suffocates Miia and slimes Centorea and Kimihito. The two of them are in the bath trying to get themselves clean when the slime appears again, and Kimihito notices how she seems to be mimicking everyone`s actions. After some further mishaps Papi befriends her, giving her the name Suu. Miia and Centorea consider that she is quite possibly an illegal, and as such they ought to report her to Ms. Smith as soon as possible to avoid trouble. This worries Papi who suddenly flies off with her, and Kimihito chases after them. They play with a bunch of neighborhood kids who are friends with Papi, and Suu saves a little girl from getting hit by a truck. They arrive home to find that Ms. Smith is there.",
