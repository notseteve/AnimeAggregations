Thinking this is just somebody`s idea of a prank, Fushihara doesn`t think much of it at all. But then one day, instead of a letter, what do they receive but a package in the mail! Fushihara and the two little ghosts are frozen stiff as something inside the package begins to stir. What might be about to come out...?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
