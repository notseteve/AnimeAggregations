  "description" : "Shinpachi returns home with a gift for his sister—a doll that oddly resembles Elizabeth, with the name “Space Monster Stefan” printed on its chest. But what awaits Shinpachi is a deadly naginata swing by the raged Otae. While Shinpachi narrowly dodges the attack, Stefan falls prey to the naginata. As she tears Stefan apart, Otae explains the reason behind her fit. It appears the panty thief who’s recently been stirring things up in Edo city stole her panties. To soothe her sister’s anger, Shinpachi decides to ask for help from Gintoki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
