  "description" : "Shizuka is asked to perform at Chihaya`s charity concert at the last minute. Mirai suggests this might be an opportunity for Shizuka`s father, who opposes her becoming an idol, to see her perform. Through her lessons with Chihaya, Shizuka feels strongly that she wants to become more like Chihaya so her father will accept her dream. Two days before the concert, Chihaya takes Shizuka and her friends to the auditorium where the concert will be held.\nSource: crunchyroll",
