  "description" : "Tamama gets the disturbing idea into his head that if he kisses Keroro to wake him up, Keroro will be all \"lovey-dovey\" for him.  As Keroro flees in abject horror from Tamama`s grotesque, oversized lips, everybody but Keroro winds up getting the smooch treatment.  Afterwards, Mois discovers a wrinkle on Pururu`s face, and she can`t bring herself to say anything.  Everyone in the platoon is cringing and trying not to bring it up during their checkups with the nurse.\nSource: crunchyroll",
