  "description" : "Tokio and Calen arrive to Tuscany in 1820 and meet Nightingale, who had just been born. They then continue to Time Bokan looking for the True History as she grows up, but Nightingale continues to grow more and more high-handed. She then makes a white nurse’s uniform and starts posing in it. Bimajo makes the comment that rather than an angel in white, she seems like a tengu in white. It’s then that Calen’s visor gets a signal... Wait, that’s the True History this time?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
