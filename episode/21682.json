  "description" : "On the eve of becoming an adult, Prince Siegfried and his companions stumble upon a lake in the woods. Siegfried spies a beautiful swan with a crown on its head and is immediately enchanted, but when one of his friends is magically turned to stone when he tries to kill the rare find. The prince follows the enigmatic swan to a castle, where it transforms into a gorgeous young woman, Princess Odette. The two fall fast in love, but Odette reveals that an evil sorcerer, Rothbart, has captured and cursed her until she agrees to marry him. Siegfried must choose his bride the following day at a palace ball, and exhorts Odette to go so that he may pick her, but the treacherous Rothbart has other plans, sending his wicked daughter Odile in the guise of Odette to steal the young prince’s heart. Set against the score of Tchaikovsky’s breathtaking waltz, Swan Lake is a timeless fairy tale that explores the theme of true love.\nSource: crunchyroll",
