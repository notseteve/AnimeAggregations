  "description" : "God says, \"Let there be light\". Then there is light. God creates order in the formless chaotic universe. God separates the sky from the ground, the land from the sea, and creates life on the ground, in the sea, and in the sky. The world is created in seven days. Then the first human beings are made in the image of the god. They are Adam and Eve.\nSource: http://tezukaosamu.net",
