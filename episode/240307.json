  "description" : "Winter has arrived in Tempest, and so much snow has fallen that its residents can`t open their doors until it`s shoveled away. But there are at least three like minds there who are finding it hard to resist their childlike urges to dive into the fresh snow: Rimuru, Milim, and Shion. Thus the work begins all around town to shovel Tempest out of the deep snow. Youm objects to being asked to help since he isn`t even a citizen, but when he`s given the choice between shoveling snow and training with Hakuro, he eagerly grabs the shovel and gets to work.\nSource: crunchyroll",
