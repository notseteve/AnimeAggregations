  "description" : "The world is racked with abnormal weather and natural disasters, conditions that keep all the Fairy Tail wizards busy. Natsu and Lucy take on a job to investigate major changes in celestial bodies, only to find it`s a set-up. When they`re attacked by a giant sea slug, none of Lucy`s regular Celestial Spirits answer her calls for help. But as if to answer this mystery, Virgo appears, although her appearance and attitude are way off the mark. In fact, it seems that what Virgo wants most is to punish Lucy!\nSource: crunchyroll",
