  "description" : "Kaito has found himself in a slump going up against Ageha, who is copying his older brother \nHaruto`s performance. Noticing this, Uozumi pulls Kaito and Hoshitani aside and suggests that they switch the roles that they are going to be auditioning for. This obviously upsets Kaito, who took on the most difficult role for both his team and for himself, and he is unable to be swayed. This situation sends a wave of dissonance throughout all the teams as the boys struggle to find their motivations for the upcoming auditions. Will they be able to overcome their anxiety?\nSource: crunchyroll",
