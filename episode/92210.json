  "description" : "Tsuna continues his training with Hibari in preparation for their plan five days later. Hibari is sick of dealing with Tsuna and asks him how long he`s going to keep fighting like a herbivore, and leaves to his room. Tsuna cannot think of any way to use his V.R. X Gloves. The person who gives him an idea for a killer technique is Lambo, who is always annoying, and Haru. Tsuna feels that he can fight because he has support… He takes those feelings and puts them into his technique.\nSource: crunchyroll",
