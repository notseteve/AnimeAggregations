  "description" : "Haneru and Kanon end up fighting over which of \"Squid`s Whistle\" and \"Squirt Serenade,\" their preferred snacks respectively, is better. It`s a trivial argument, but having let the chance to apologize slip by, the two find it hard to make up. And after hearing about it, Mizuki and Yuzuru get into the same argument and, instead of smoothing things over between the two, only make things worse. What`s more, Yuji appears in front of Haneru and Kanon, and turns it into the worst-case scenario.\nSource: crunchyroll",
