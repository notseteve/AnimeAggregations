  "description" : "Yashunobu, Yamato`s \"friend\" from childhood suddenly shows up one day in Yamato`s room. His past is revealed to be a perverted child. He never shows this trait in front of adults, so he is thought to be more mature than Yamato. In addition, it is revealed that he is also very mischievous, playing tricks all the time. To prevent Yasunobu from hitting on Suzuka, Yamato tells Yasunobu that Suzuka is an ugly 50-year-old woman, getting himself in trouble with Suzuka.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
