  "description" : "Now that it is clear that Mei is a Tamayori who can see ghosts, she decides to help Syunso find the black cat that became a divine spirit and left his painting. While conducting their search, Mei and Syunso happen to run across Koizumi Yakumo and Izumi Kyoka and Yakumo asks Mei for her help in investigating some paranormal happenings at his hotel. The ghost, it turns out, is likely a childhood friend of Yakumo`s. Ougai is against the investigation out of concern for Mei, but she insists on helping regardless.\nSource: crunchyroll",
