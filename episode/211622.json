  "description" : "As Lord Daigo Kagemitsu waits for his wife to give birth, he recalls the time he made a pact with the 12 demons in the Hall of Hell, prepared to tread the path of evil in exchange for power. When his son is born, the demons extract their payment, the child is born without limbs, facial features or skin. The baby is set adrift in the river and left to its fate. Sixteen years later, he is now a young man, travelling alone wearing prosthesis made by Dr. Jukai. While hunting a sludge-like demon, he encounters Dororo, a young petty-thief being beaten by three men Dororo cheated out of their goods. The demon attacks and devours the men, but the youth destroys it with blades inside his prosthetic arms. Following the death of the demon Deiki, the youth`s skin appears, and a demon statue in the Hall of Hell is split by lightning. Meanwhile back in Ishikawa, Daigo`s second son Tahoumaru returns home from hunting, although his mother still misses her first son.\nSource: Revolvy",
