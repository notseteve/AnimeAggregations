  "description" : "The JSDF expeditionary force remains camped just outside the Gate on the other side, and decimates the allied forces that attack it, their medieval-level technology no match for modern weaponry and military tactics. This is, however, actually a gambit by Emperor Molt to weaken the kingdoms that are only nominally under his authority and keep them from rebelling. With their armies largely destroyed they are unable to resist his subsequent scorched-earth tactics. The emperor`s daughter, Pinya, is ordered to lead her order of knights to investigate the JSDF and learn all she can about them.\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, the President of the United States considers sending an American force beyond the Gate as well, lured by the prospect of immense resources in the lands beyond, despite the political implications. Domestic opposition in Japan to the JSDF`s operation beyond the Gate is mounting as well, so the President is convinced to bide his time.\nYouji is made commander of a reconnaissance unit whose job is to make contact with the locals and establish friendly relations with them. Along the way, they find a dragon burning a village. When they reach it after the dragon leaves, they find a woman at the bottom of a well, apparently the only survivor.",
