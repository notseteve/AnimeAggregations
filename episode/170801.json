  "description" : "Yao goes around the settlement of Arnus and the JSDF basecamp, but is unfortunately unable to make herself understood to the JSDF soldiers she meets. She falls prey to thugs and robbers but is able to defend herself but one of them reports her and she is eventually arrested by MPs. Leilei, being the best bilingual speaker manages to get her story and the thug is instead taken into custody, and she eventually secures for Yao an audience with General Hazama. Yao explains her errand, but the General refuses to help. The settlements of Yao`s people can only be reached by crossing imperial territory, and if he sends enough forces there to defeat the dragon that would be interpreted by the Empire as an act of war. Frustrated in her mission, she overhears stories about Itami and how he might manage to do something to help, and so when she goes to the refugee dormitories she asks Tuka about him.\nItami meanwhile has escorted a second diplomat to join Pinya, and is being sent as part of a delegation to the capital.",
