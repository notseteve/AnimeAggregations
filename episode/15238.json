  "description" : "Strange things begin to happen in Tomobiki Town, in director`s Kazuo Yamazaki`s lyrical odyssey of animation. When Ataru cuts down Mendou`s great cherry tree, Tarouzakura, for the sake of a film, Lum loses her powers and the entire town gets pulled into a philosophical journey that bridges the gap between what is real and what is not. But that`s just the beginning...\nAs the tree dies, the town`s memories become twisted, dreamscapes become reality, and war seems to be the only answer.\nThrough all this, the citizens of Tomobiki must find a way to live together through the destruction of their own memories.\nLove, marriage, Japanese folklore, and a swarm of cicadas are packed into this adventure that probes the meaning of life and allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions about these comical characters who are not very different from us.\nSource: crunchyroll",
