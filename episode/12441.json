  "description" : "Towa tells Sawa that revealing the mermaid`s location will save Mana. Mana revives as they approach the mermaid tomb. Yuta arrives at the tomb and tells Towa that eating mermaid flesh will only complete her transformation into a Deformed One. He also says being immortal was lonely before he found Mana. Towa says immortality or transformation makes no difference and forces a piece of mermaid flesh on Sawa, explaining that Sawa had desired immortality. Too afraid to try it herself, Sawa had experimented on Towa, her biological twin. Then, while Towa had lived in confinement, Sawa had lived a full life. Towa wants Sawa to be immortal, as an old woman or as a monster. Sawa dies of a heart attack, denying Towa her revenge. Towa tells the others to burn the tomb, the house, and everything in them, including Towa. As they watch the fire burn, Shiina says that he had tried to convince Towa to escape with him when he was young. Towa had refused, saying she had to stay to get her revenge. Mana asks Yuta if being alone before was hard.\nSource: Wiki",
