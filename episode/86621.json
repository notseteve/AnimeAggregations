  "description" : "After a fierce battle, the Sky battle is settled, and the battle for the rings comes to an end. Xanxus is rejected by the ring and is disqualified. The successors of the Vongola Rings are Tsuna and his six Guardians. Xanxus yells out of rage. The Cervello talk to him as if they have known everything all along. In the end, they never reveal who they are. They declare that the battle has ended. Tsuna finally looks relieved. Tsuna has nothing more to worry about, so he passes out. The next day, Tsuna wakes up to find Reborn, who smiles and tells him that they`re having a party.\nSource: crunchyroll",
