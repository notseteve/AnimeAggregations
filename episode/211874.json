  "description" : "Suema Kazuko finds out that Kinukawa Kotoe`s attitude has changed ever since she had requested Suema to help her with Asukai Jin. Suema can`t help but feel that there`s something deeper at play with Kotoe`s sudden attitude change, and she goes to visit Asukai to see if she can find out the truth. Suema asks him if he`s sure he doesn`t know the reason that Kotoe changed, but Asukai just changes the subject and starts talking about his own personal goals.\nSource: crunchyroll",
