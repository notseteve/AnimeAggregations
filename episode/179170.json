  "description" : "A giant monster is stalking the streets of Japan!  Or so it seems, until Unit 8 finds out that it`s just a holographic projection.  One of Sena`s favorite directors is believed to be behind the crime, and Sena leaps at the chance to clear the man`s name.  But to stop the holographic monster from burning down half the city, he`ll need lots of chaff, which means talking to his ex-girlfriend in the Unified Self Defense Forces, and she might be scarier than the monster!\nSource: crunchyroll",
