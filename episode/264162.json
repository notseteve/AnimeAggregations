  "description" : "Souta, Hayate, Shun, Souma, Takayuki, and Motoharu have made their way to the ocean. While Shun is super hyped to swim, Motoharu and Souta are more into drinking on the beach. With everybody free to do whatever they like, Takayuki volunteers to watch their bags and have some quiet time. Takayuki usually only realizes that summer is already over when it`s too late, but this year he`s actually enjoying it and talks to Souma about a CD cover design that he`s working on.\nSource: crunchyroll",
