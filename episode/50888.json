  "description" : "Many of the water touring companies in Neo-Venezia have their own palina - a tall, decorated pole used to hitch gondolas.  But strangely, the Aria Company doesn`t have one.  When Akari asks Alicia about it, Alicia gives her full permission to make a palina of her own!  It`s tough work building something from scratch, but Akari is determined to make the best palina possible.\nSource: crunchyroll",
