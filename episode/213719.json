  "description" : "Today is my photography contest with Yatogame. We were supposed to meet at Nagoya Station, but I couldn`t find her anywhere until we ran into each other near a golden clock.

So now Yatogame is dragging me off to take pictures of famous spots around Nagoya... but just where is she going to take me?\nSource: crunchyroll",
