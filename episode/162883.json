  "description" : "Minato is filled with regret during his confrontation with Obito. He thinks if only he had recognized Obito as the Masked Man during the assault on the Hidden Leaf Village, he could have stopped the attack, and maybe Kushina would not have died. The next day is the anniversary of Minato`s and Kushina`s deaths. Obito taunts Minato as a weak shinobi and seals every shinobi inside a barrier in order to destroy them all!\nSource: crunchyroll",
