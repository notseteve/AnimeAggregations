  "description" : "Kou accidentally breaks a window and is determined to pay for it herself, (as well as the for dishes she has been breaking). She turns to Misaki for advice, and Misaki suggests that getting a part-time job would be the best thing in order to pay for repairs to the window. Kou`s first job is at the tea shop, where Kuu tags along for fun. Kou is fired for breaking many of the dishes, and Kuu is fired for yelling at the customers and eating a lot of food during work. They get new jobs at Domo Burgers, where many girls line up just to order from Kuu in her male form. Kou gets fired for preparing food poorly, while Kuu is fired for flirting. They both get jobs at Ebisu`s market delivering pizzas. Kou gets lost and cannot find the delivery address; Kuu delivers pizza by throwing them on customers` doorsteps without obtaining payment - and those are all promptly stolen by a cat-demon who is a fan of Kuu. Kou and Kuu are fired once again.\nSource: crunchyroll",
