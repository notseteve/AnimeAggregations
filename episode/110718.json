  "description" : "Gintoki strikes down Jiraia and frees Tsukuyo from his twisted web. Chiding Tsukuyo for trying to shoulder every burden herself, Gintoki goes on to say that rather than throw away your life to die beautifully, it’s far better to live and be yourself – even if your life is not a pretty one. And finally, Gintoki expresses his anger toward Jiraia for betraying his own student, despite calling himself a master.\nSource: crunchyroll",
