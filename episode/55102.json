The Akatsuki, a defense warship, departs to exterminate the jellyfish, but the task is beyond its capacity. Even Akira and the party who joined to offer their support are swallowed by the jellyfish. This giant jellyfish is actually a giant robot that Hulahope, the boss of the Chinchira Party, has developed. The mammoth jellyfish unceasingly attacks oil tankers, bringing the world into a serious oil crisis.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
