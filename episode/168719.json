  "description" : "In an attempt to finally get to school properly on time, Chitoge rushes, but along the way her precious ribbon is lost. She is inconsolable for several days as efforts by her and her friends to find it are unavailing, although Ichijou comments that he might like the gentler Chitoge better. Eventually, he decides to get her a similar ribbon and pass it off as the original, but she can tell that it is a new one. They see her real ribbon atop a telephone pole, but it flies off just as Chitoge tries to get it, and it is apparently destroyed by a passing train. But Ichijou tells her it was the fake ribbon, and hands her the real one, which flew away in a different direction. Her personality reverts to the old, violent one. She does, however, patch up even the fake ribbon.\nChitoge is reading a romance manga where she sees the main heroine confess her love. This makes her think of trying to do so to Ichijou, but she is unable to do so. She talks to her father about it was with him and her mother, and he tells her how effortless it had been. Later, as Chitoge is walking with Ichijou, he talks about how it had been more than a year since their strange arrangement began and how he`d like  to continue taking things slowly.",
