  "description" : "Kakeru is unable to recall what happened when he kicked the ball, leading Nana to suspect Suguru`s heart is the cause. At the hospital, Suguru`s sport counselor, Ayaka Mine, examines Kakeru and reminds him to exercise for his heart. She secretly tasks Nana to watch for Suguru-like behavior from Kakeru possibly resulted from the transplant. That night, Kakeru learns that the masked stranger is Nana and that he received a heart transplant from Suguru. As Kakeru reads through Suguru`s dairy, he discovers his brother`s frustration with the forwards in Japan`s national team and how he desires Kakeru to fill that position. The next day, Kakeru tells Nana he will enroll in Enoshima High where Ryuichi Araki, a passer with skills like Suguru, is located.\nSource: Wikipedia",
