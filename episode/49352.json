  "description" : "Another wonderful holiday has arrived: Festa Del Bocolo!  This day is a celebration of an ages-old story on Manhome, about a knight whose love for his lady lived on after his death in the form of a rose.  In Neo-Venezia, that means that women everywhere receive roses from the people who admire them.  Akatsuki wants to give Alicia as many roses as he can, but he`s too nervous to deliver them (even though he`d never admit it).  Will Akari be able to help?\nSource: crunchyroll",
