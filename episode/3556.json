  "description" : "Sakura had heard a rumor about a singing ghost in the music room at our school, but when she investigated it, she discovered it was actually a Clow Card! Xiaolang suggested that she should explore the school at night to find out the truth, despite how afraid she was, she decided to do it. Sakura`s so brave! We snuck in together, and when we got inside we were surprised to find Xiaolang and Meiling there. We all heard a voice coming from the music room, and even though Meiling scared it off, we were able to figure out what it was- the Song card had been practicing a song I`d been singing for class earlier! We figured out that Song will only appear when the person it`s copying- me in this case- sings for it. So I sang for everyone, and at last Sakura was able to seal the card away!\nSource: crunchyroll",
