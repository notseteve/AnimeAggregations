  "description" : "Goku and Whis arrive on Beerus` planet, where Vegeta is tasked with housekeeping. Goku is surprised to learn that Vegeta has gotten considerably stronger training under Whis and so wants to start his training right away. Before he is allowed to, however, Whis orders him to help Vegeta with the chores including changing Beerus` bed sheets without waking him up. Goku and Vegeta promptly do their chores and start their training with Whis. Whis` training routine quickly wears Goku out, and he falls asleep, while Vegeta, willing to surpass Goku at any cost, keeps on training. The next day, Whis decides to have a sparring match with his apprentices in order to gauge their speed. The two prove to be no match for Whis, being too slow to land a single hit. Meanwhile, somewhere in space, surviving members of Freeza`s army, led by Sorbet, continue with their effort of resurrecting their leader. Not far off, mysterious beings from a different Universe, known only as Shanpa and Vados, continue their search for Beerus.\nSource: Wikipedia",
