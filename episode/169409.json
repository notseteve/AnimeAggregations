  "description" : "Misumi Rin admonishes a couple in the hall holding hands, she is seen by Karen who reports the incident to the Student Council. This prompts a discussion among them about it, and they all admit that none of them have actually even dated a guy to begin with. Hayato says that their policy of liberalising love amounts to a direct challenge to Rin`s Morals Committee, and then Rin and Makoto arrive themselves. There is a bit of an argument, Hayato saying that she is overreacting about hand-holding, and then takes her hand to illustrate. This flusters her greatly and she leaves.\nLater that night in Hayato`s home, Ui tries to experiment with hand-holding. He eventually gets deeply flustered himself as she goes on to licking his fingers, eventually escalating to dry humping. She later concludes that hand-holding does indeed lead to indecent feelings, but she still refuses to accept Rin`s position, saying that if not taken too far such physical contact strengthens a couple`s feelings for each other and enables them to accept each others` imperfections.",
