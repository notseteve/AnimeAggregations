  "description" : "Kouichi and Yamashita are met by KATO-KIKAN’s new ARMA in outer space.\nWhile controlling the satellite weapon, the new ARMA, YAOYOROZU continues its simultaneous assault on different parts of the world. \nKouichi’s attempts to obliterate YAOYOROZU are thwarted by its incredible maneuverability and speed.\nThe operation to destroy the satellite weapon from the ground also ends in failure. With no options left, even LINEBARREL gets diverted off the combat zone.\nSource: crunchyroll",
