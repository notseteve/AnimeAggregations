  "description" : "It is summer vacation and Hayato accompanies Ui for various meetings at school. While waiting for her, he sees Makoto carrying a huge bag full of books, clearly much too heavy for her, and watches as she falls over. He brings her to the infirmary and returns the books to the library. Thinking Makoto asleep Hayato reads aloud a somewhat intimate text message from Ui, leading Makoto to suspect him of having an illicit relationship. Afterwards, she sneaks behind him as he walks home, which irritates him, and he shouts at her, startling her enough that she urinates a little. Hayato thus brings Makoto to his home and lets her take a shower to clean herself up. She notices signs that Ui is living with him, and his excuses are unavailing, so he admits that he is living with Ui, but denies that they are in a relationship. She tries to get Hayato to consider Rin as well as a candidate, and is on the point of seducing him when Ui comes home. Makoto asks Ui what she likes about Hayato, and she gushes about him, clearly deeply in love.",
