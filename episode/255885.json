  "description" : "Now that Pino has been run out of Heaven, she fears that someone will be coming from there at any time to eliminate her. She heads to the park, where she hears Yurine`s angry voice. Startled, Pino looks over to see Yurine`s fist flying toward Jashin-chan... but striking a little girl instead. Yurine panics when she realizes what she`s done, but the child seems unfazed. Pino then realizes that the child is Lierre, the God of Heaven, on a visit to the human realm.\nSource: crunchyroll",
