  "description" : "Jil and his party encounter another party that has practically been wiped out in a fierce battle against the ogres. There they manage to rescue an aged warrior called Gigi who was an acclaimed Guardian of the past. They take Gigi to a camping area on the way but are unable to take a moment of rest as they are plagued by one jam after another. One of the party members has a wallet pick-pocketed while a heated argument erupts between Coopa and Melt. In the end, reconciliation seems out of the question as Coopa, disgusted by her petulant master, decides to leave the party to be on her own!\nSource: crunchyroll",
