  "description" : "Tai and everyone else gose off to look for Matt. Matt is not really sure why he is a DigiDestined and gets upset that the others are getting stronger and better then he is (or so he thinks..he`s sort of loosing is mind at this point..oh, sorry). Anyway, a tree-like Digimon called Cherrymon, tells him that he must be the leader and in order to be the leader, he must destroy Tai. Puppetmon and Garbagemon attack the others. The kids are having problems with the battle, until Matt shows up with MetalGarurumon and blast away the Garbagemon. Then, as if things weren`t bad enough, MetalGarurumon turns on Agumon (at Matt`s decision) and challenges him to a fight.\nSource: crunchyroll",
