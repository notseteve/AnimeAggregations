  "description" : "Raul Chaser was working towards becoming a Hero to defeat the Demon Lord, but just as his training was coming to an end the Demon Lord was unexpectedly defeated and the programme to train heroes was cancelled. With his original purpose gone he reluctantly has to find a job, and winds up working as a clerk in the Royal Capital store, which sells appliances and consumer goods. One day, Fino Bloodstone comes into the store looking for a job, and he sees from her résumé that she is actually the child of the Demon Lord, though he doesn`t at first realise that she`s even a girl. He has to teach her a lot of things about the human world in addition to her duties at the store, and is exasperated at her naivete and ignorance.",
