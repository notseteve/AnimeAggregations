  "description" : "Ash has entered the World Coronation Series so he can have a rematch with Leon! But first, he needs to challenge a strong Trainer with a high ranking so he can work his way up the competitive ladder. Luckily for him, the acting Vermilion Gym Leader, Visquez, is hoping to challenge someone, too! Each Trainer can use two Pokémon, so Ash chooses Pikachu and Gengar, while Visquez teams up with Raichu and Electrode. Visquez has outstanding battle skills, but as always, Ash is thinking outside the box when it comes to strategies. He wins the match, immediately raising his rank to 3,763! On to the next challenge!\nSource: Official Website",
