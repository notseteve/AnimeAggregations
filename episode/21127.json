  "description" : "On a small hill stands a huge board called \"Banmon.\" When Hyakkimaru and Dororo decide to stay there for a night, the fox goblin of Kuo attacks them. At dawn, the fox goblin disappears, but then the execution of those who have tried to cross the border without permission begins. Kagemitsu, who has put a curse on Hyakkimaru, takes command of the execution. Getting angry about the brutality of it all, Hyakkimaru challenges Kagemitsu without knowing that he is his own father. Looking at Hyakkimaru`s abnormal body, Kagemitsu realizes that the young man is the caterpillar-like baby that he had thrown into the river. Kagemitsu gets flustered, and withdraws his soldiers. Later, Hyakkimaru meets a young warrior named Tahomaru. They fight at first, but soon become friends. Together the two decide to defeat the fox goblin of Kuo.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
