  "description" : "Kazuma and Hiyori have been locked in a dungeon by Kugaha. Hiyori notices that unlike all of Bishamon`s other Shinki, Kazuma`s name does not end in `ha` (巴) but `ma` (麻). All gods add a common character to the names of all their shinki which acts as a clan name, and Kazuma explains that the difference is because he is the only survivor from Bishamon`s previous `ma` clan: all the rest were massacred by Yato centuries ago at his own request, as it was the only way to purge her from a blight that had spread to all the rest of her shinki, but she never learned this truth. Kazuma realises that Kugaha`s plan seems to be that he is conspiring to kill Bishamon, so that when she is reborn he can take Kazuma`s place as her exemplar. He abducted Hiyori in order to goad Yato into killing Bishamon.\nYato, just as Kugaha planned, has realised that Hiyori has been abducted and makes his way with Yukine to the realm of the gods with Tenjin`s assistance. Yato demands that Bishamon release Hiyori, who of course doesn`t know what he is talking about, and the two gods have a great battle, and while for a time it seems they are evenly matched Bishamon`s shinki manage to bind him, and Bishamon manages to break Yukine in his sword form.",
