  "description" : "When they get back, Suzuka takes her leave after Honoka approaches them. Honoka, apparently, was very “worried” about Yamato, but when he tells her he likes her for the first time, she is completely confident. Later on, Yasunobu reveals that he knows about Yamato and Honoka, and states that he should bring the relationship to the next level, causing Yamato to stutter and decline. When Honoka goes over to Yamato’s home to cook for him, he suddenly starts thinking about Suzuka. To convince himself that he likes Honoka, he lets his impulse drive him, causing Honoka to run away scared.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
