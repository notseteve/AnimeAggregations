  "description" : "Takeshi`s friend tells him a rumor about a ghost that wanders, looking for a collar. When he gets home, he finds an old collar there! That night, the ghost of a young girl appears before him, and he learns that the ghost is looking for her dog, Shiro, who she lost during a bombing raid during the war.\nPochi appears in front of Tama wearing a strange, old collar. Pochi seems different than usual, so Tama follows him and ends up in a field he`s never seen before. There, Tama learns that Pochi`s been possessed by the ghost of a dog named Shiro who`d lost his life in the war.\nSource: crunchyroll",
