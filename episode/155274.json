  "description" : "Fino and Raul have managed to sell an air conditioning unit to an old lady who was overwhelmed by the technical jargon and overly large selection at Amada, only to find that her son-in-law has at the same time purchased a different air conditioner from Amada himself, so they are now double booked. Raul decides to concede the sale to Amada as that is what the customer seems to want, but as they are about to leave the son-in-law stops them as now they are having trouble as their appliances have stopped working. The tech from Amada examines the place, and determines that they might have faulty wiring, which will be very expensive to repair. Further examination by Lore however uncovers a massive infestation of magic eaters, slime-like pests that consume household magical energy. They use Fino`s immense magical power inherited from her father to draw out the magic eaters, and manage to eliminate the infestation. Their efforts convince the son-in-law to take Leon`s air conditioner instead of Amada`s, despite the penalties that will be charged.",
