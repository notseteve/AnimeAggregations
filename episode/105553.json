  "description" : "Concern for Chrome brings Tsuna to Kokuyo Health Land. Hibari and Mukuro suddenly show up. The longstanding grudge between the two comes to a boil as soon as their eyes meet and they begin to fight! Tsuna can’t figure out what to do. It seems this unlikely situation was created by Skull, the Arcobaleno with the purple pacifier. At this rate, Hibari and Mukuro will continue to fight until one of them falls. Tsuna becomes panicked when Lal tells him that his trial has begun. On one side, there`s Skull`s trial and on the other side, Hibari and Mukuro are in fierce combat. Furthermore, Ken and Chikusa show up after noticing the chaos. It`s mayhem!\nSource: crunchyroll",
