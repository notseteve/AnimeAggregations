  "description" : "Today is Hanamaru Kindergarten`s entrance ceremony, but new teacher Tsuchida-sensei sleeps in anyway. As he hurries to school, he runs into a little girl on the side of the road. Concerned for the girl all by herself, he talks to her. Thinking Tsuchida-sensei is hitting on her, the girl bursts with excitement. Afterwards, Tsuchida-sensei rushes to the kindergarten and anxiously participates in the entrance ceremony.  \nThe mother of Anzu, the little girl Tsuchida-sensei ran into on his way to kindergarten, turns out to be Sakura, his high school classmate. Returning home after the entrance ceremony, Anzu listens to her mother tell old stories about her high school days, and Anzu begins calling Tsuchida-sensei “Tsuchi” just like her mother. As her parents are preparing for bed, Anzu watches her father give her mother a good night kiss. Sakura tells Anzu to get a kiss from her father too, but Anzu refuses, saying she will get one from her darling instead.\nSource: crunchyroll",
