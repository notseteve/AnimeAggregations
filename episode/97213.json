  "description" : "Yoichi and the Ikarugas reach the Saginomiya residence, and are immediately attacked by Sakon and her henchmen. There are too many of them and eventually even Yoichi is overwhelmed by their numbers, until Washizu, Tsubasa, and Angela arrive to help.\nEventually they arrive face to face with Ukyou and Sakon, but Ukyou makes his escape to the roof of their mansion with Ibuki. Yoichi manages to reach him and they have a duel, and as dawn breaks and the other Ikaruga sisters arrive at the roof Ibuki somehow seems to regain her memories, but falls, but Yoichi and her sisters dive in after her, and he manages to use his skills to soften their landing.\nYoichi writes a letter to his father, telling him of the Ikarugas and how he realises that he still has so much to learn and will continue to remain with them.",
