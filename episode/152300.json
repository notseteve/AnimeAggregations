  "description" : "Megu is a sick girl whose mind has also become as unhealthy as her body. She entertains romantic ideas about death and dying, desperate for attention from her busy father. The mischievous little doll with black wings, Suigintou, thinks she has found an easy mark to drain, but despite her openly evil nature, she finds the human girl`s willingness to die unnerving. In the meantime, Jun receives another book in the mail. He is actually excited to find out what doll he can make next despite already dealing with the prissy and demanding Shinku, but she orders him under no uncertain terms not to open his new book.\nSource: crunchyroll",
