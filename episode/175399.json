  "description" : "A small rakugo performance takes place at an inn in a hot springs town. Kikuhiko, Konatsu, and Matsuda have all been waiting to see Sukeroku take to the stage. Sukeroku feels the warmth of the audience`s love for rakugo, and remembers what it means to be a storyteller. Kikuhiko brings the 7th Generation Yakumo`s montsuki for him to wear, and and he performs the story \"Shibahama.\" Time, which had stopped for Sukeroku and Kikuhiko, begins to move again... As it does for Miyokichi, as well.\nSource: crunchyroll",
