  "description" : "As the investigation in Marburry Workshop continues, lightning strikes yet again to create a new victim. Lord El-Melloi II and Hishiri Adashino once again are on opposing grounds concerning the perpetrator of this case. Lord El-Melloi II seeks the help of the Necromancer Kairi Shishigou to reinvestigate. Gray and Shishigou are assaulted by a fierce beast, the Black Dog, that suddenly appeared before them. Based on the fact that the Black Dog reacted to Gray`s Mystic Code, Lord El-Melloi II elicits a certain conclusion. He then starts preparing for a ritual with the assistance of all Mages who were gathered at Marburry Workshop.\nSource: crunchyroll",
