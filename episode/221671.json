  "description" : "While everyone is snowed in by the harsh winter, Myne has a plan: a plan to craft pseudo-papyrus as the first step towards making a book. Meanwhile, Eva teaches Turi a bunch of skills in order to prepare her for her upcoming baptism in the summer. Myne is told to think about where she wants to apprentice, but as always, books are the only thing on her mind. As winter rolls on, however, the family bonds and grows closer together, and Myne hits upon the perfect gift to give Turi to wear on her baptism day.\nSource: crunchyroll",
