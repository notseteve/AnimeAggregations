  "description" : "Ichika and Kaito spend some time close together (which Ichika credits to Kanna). Speaking of Kanna, she, depressed, shuts herself in her room after a visit from Tetsurou, who tells everyone that she has a cold. He meets Mio on the way, where they shared the cake she was to give Kanna. There Mio asks and hears his reason why he invited Ichika to do the film with them. Angry at himself, Tetsurou kicks the wooden railing and injures himself. The next day Tetsurou invites Kanna to their old playground as kindergarten kids, and confesses to her, but she rejects him; and as she runs off to Kaito`s place to confess (only to be rejected by Kaito anyway), Tetsuro falls on his knees, where Mio sneaks from behind and hugs him, saying it`s alright to cry. The filming of the movie continues, but one day Ichika`s older sister appears.\nSource: Wiki",
