  "description" : "To start a new association requires five members... but the main thing the girls need in order to play baseball is a place to practice! But there are no suitable locations at the school for playing baseball. Tsubasa and the others are worried, but they tell themselves that all they can do is start with whatever is possible right now. They start by visiting a baseball shop to buy equipment. As they`re picking out gloves, they realize that Suzuki Waka, a classmate of Tsubasa and Yuuki`s, is also at the shop.\nSource: crunchyroll",
