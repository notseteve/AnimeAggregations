  "description" : "Ojo talks about becoming number one in Japan with the teammates he`s trained so hard alongside through kabaddi. For that purpose, he wants them to experience a match, so he arranges a practice game with a school whose team includes a member who was part of the World Squad, a group of top-tier kabaddi athletes. They will be facing Ojo`s old friend and rival, Rokugen Ayumu, and the ace raider, Takaya Ren, on a powerhouse team that made it to the Kanto region`s final four — Souwa High School`s kabaddi team.\nSource: crunchyroll",
