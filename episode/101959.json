  "description" : "Today’s Tsu Terakado concert is another lively success. But fan club president Shinpachi is angered because only four of the Tsu Terakado fan club members have come to the concert. He is further enraged to learn that many of the club members have left without permission and have joined the new Tsusentai fan club instead. To Shinpachi’s surprise, the Tsusentai leader is Hijikata, who thanks to the demonic sword’s curse has now become a charismatic otaku! Can Shinpachi protect his only(?) distinctive trait from Tosshi’s onslaught?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
