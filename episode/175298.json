  "description" : "While doing summer assignments with Rihito and Shouta at a family restaurant, Momo-kun develops a fever and goes down for the count. Rihito plans to have Kurihara-san visit Momo-kun at his house. With Momo-kun sick and Kurihara-san caring for him, the two of them get to spend some time alone together in his room. While Momo-kun is asleep with a fever, Kurihara-san thinks about taking a picture of him, but... she begins making porridge as though she suddenly remembered that`s what she meant to do. Kurihara-san simply watches Momo-kun as he sleeps soundly, and when he awakes, she speaks to him before leaving. Later, Momo-kun recalls the events of another day while resting in bed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
