  "description" : "Moses does not come back from the mountain, so people set up an altar and pray to God for Moses` safety. They need a statue for prayer, so they make a bull as a statue of God. God sees this and says to Moses on the summit. \"Go down immediately. The people of Israel are corrupt.\" God strictly forbids people to deify anything except himself, or to worship any idol.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
