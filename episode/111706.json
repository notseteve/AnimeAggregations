  "description" : "Natsuru finds himself sitting next to Kaede outside the hotel, who hypnotizes him into making Shizuku his. Kaede then disappears when Natsuru, who can`t remember anything after leaving the room, is found and confronted by Akane, Shizuku and Mikoto in their respective Kämpfer forms. They return to the hotel where they are greeted by Kaede who doesn`t appear to recall seeing the fireworks with Natsuru either. Afterwards, they all go (with Natsuru in female form) to the women`s baths, where Natsuru`s hypnotism kicks in and he then brings Shizuku back to the room to make a move on her, but he gets knocked out when he let slip that Kaede told him to do it. It is also revealed in a scene that Kaede appears to be in command of the White Kämpfer. The next day, Kaede whispers something in Shizuku`s ear, confirming her suspicions. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
