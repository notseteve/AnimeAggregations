  "description" : "The platoon has to spend the remainder of their invasion budget, almost 400 million yen, before the year is up, so they go on a wild, wasteful spending spree that makes Keroro nervous for some reason. Later, Keroro has to do something about his hoarder problem, as he`s got a warehouse full of Gundam models, DVDs, etc, but needs to put everything away in the relatively small confines of his own room.\nSource: crunchyroll",
