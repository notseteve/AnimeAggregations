Also, it’s a rematch between the Pharaoh and Rafael – but this time, the Pharaoh doesn’t have Yugi to protect him!  Is the Pharaoh still haunted by his devastating loss at the hands of Rafael? He better pull himself together, for Rafael is taking off the kiddie gloves and unleashing even more powerful guardians than before!\nSource: crunchyroll",
