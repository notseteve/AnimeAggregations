  "description" : "Sakura got sick! Since she had a fever, the nurse sent her home from school early. She didn`t get much rest though, because the Cloud card was out causing trouble. Since she`s such a hard worker, Sakura decided to capture the Cloud card even though she was sick and Kero told her not to. To fool Toya, she used Mirror to make a copy of herself before sneaking out. She looked pretty wobbly flying around, but luckily Xiaolang and Meiling were there to support her as she captured the card.\nSource: crunchyroll",
