  "description" : "One day, Sakura and Xiaolang both noticed that events throughout the day seemed to be repeating themselves. They soon discovered that the Time card was causing things to happen over and over again! Later that night, we all headed for our school`s clock tower, which was where Time had hidden itself. After a few efforts, we were finally able to invade the clock tower and reach the top. Time tried to flee, but Xiaolang used his magic to stop it and allow Sakura to seal it away. But Time didn`t go to Sakura like we expected- instead, it flew to Xiaolang. It was then that we learned each Clow Card returns to the person who actually succeeded in subduing its power.\nSource: crunchyroll",
