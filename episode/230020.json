  "description" : "Maihime Shirayuki has a laid-back personality and can’t play sports to save her life. She was chosen to be a member of HXEROS because of her hidden eros and became Hxe White, but she lacks confidence because she thinks she doesn’t have any strengths that set her apart. A Kiseichuu appears at the all-girls high school that Maihime goes to, but how will she fight this enemy and its menacing tentacles? Meanwhile, Sora Tenkuji, aka Hxe Blue, has a hobby that she can’t tell anybody about... Kirara finds out about Sora’s secret, and Sora makes Kirara take part in her antics.\nSource: Funimation",
