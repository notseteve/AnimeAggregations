  "description" : "The Saginomiya Clan are specialized demon exterminators. It is said that Isumi has the strongest power from successive generations but why did she lose it? According to Isumi`s mom, to regain lost power, it solidifies when one turns 16 but having a feminine appearance, being born unlucky as a butler, and being initially named \"Ha\" which is limited to a boy are necessary. Sure enough, is she already 16?? \nSource: crunchyroll",
