  "description" : "Sakura was pretty sad that her magic wasn`t working anymore, but Eriol gave her a flower at school, and that seemed to cheer her up a bit. He`s so nice! Xiaolang saw what happened and got pretty upset... It still hadn`t stopped raining from the day before, and Sakura decided to do something about it. When we went to search for the cause of the rain, Sakura`s magic still didn`t work and we were all trapped in water geysers! Luckily, Clow Reed talked to Sakura somehow and she managed to get her star staff working! She was even able to change a Clow Card into a Sakura Card with her new star power!\nSource: crunchyroll",
