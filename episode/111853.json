  "description" : "Natsuru wakes up on Christmas Eve morning to find out that he and his messenger, Disemboweled Tiger, have swapped bodies! Disemboweled Tiger decides to head on outside to enjoy this occasion and sees Natsuru`s friends Mikoto, Shizuku, and Akane on the streets only to notice that they`ve also been body swapped with their respective messengers, namely Strangled Stray Dog, Electrocuted Wildcat and Black Seppuku Rabbit, as well. The messengers have fun with their new bodies until they are caught sneaking out on a food bill and are forced to perform in a show. Kaede then encounters them and takes them to an amusement park, where they begin to get aroused and play erotic games with her. Kaede goes to a church to confess the sin of committing indecent acts with multiple girls all at once, but she just ends up being punished by the student council (who also happen to be working there). The messengers come to save her, but end up fighting each other instead when they discover (to their delight) that they can feel pain. After saying their goodbyes to Kaede, they ride off on a sleigh, the whole thing being a bizarre Christmas story. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
