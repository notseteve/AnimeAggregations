  "description" : "The gang finally got back together on the edge of the Forest Kingdom. Starving and tired, they decided to make camp and chow down. Then, they discovered the forest was full of these freaky trees that showed them video from the real world! While sleeping, Tapirmon came under the influence of Kepyrmon, who planted bad dreams into a sleeping Tommy. Convinced everyone was against him, he Spirit Evolved to Kumamon and took on his friends. Koji & Takuya finally figured it out, so they Spirit Evolved and ended the digital nightmare! Koji then received a weird e-mail on his D-Tector.\nSource: crunchyroll",
