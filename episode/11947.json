  "description" : "Deciding to follow the invitation of Shizuna, who said she could fix his arm, Kinjiro follows her to a mysterious basement and passes out. The pain and fatigue had pushed him to his limits. Shortly afterward, when he awakes, he feels that his pain threshold had been raised and his body feels strange. He then realizes that he`s been turned into a Shizuna-man! By the way, what`s a Shizuna-man? Thinking his outfit looks stupid, Kin-chan takes off the pieces of the Shizuna-man armor one by one as Shizuna scowls at him like some sort of monster. Then, he realizes that he can use his left arm. Though he dislikes the outfit, he`d rather have that than not be able to use his arm. Reluctantly he strips down to the bare minimum amount of armor and goes to defeat the Air Master once again. Around the same time, the younger Fukamichi brother appears once again, this time challenging Maki to a fight. But this time he doesn`t show himself and begins a fight in a showy blast of fireworks on top of a roof. At the same time, Kin-chan is out to challenge the Air Master. But this time Fukamichi declares that his opponent is the 4th ranked Minaguchi. Kinjiro suddenly gets angry proclaiming, \"I won`t just do as you want me to!\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
