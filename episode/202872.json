  "description" : "Lupin`s gang visits the northern Angel, on the outskirts of Russia. What at first seems like a snowy, dull town turns out to be full of riches to the joy of the group of thieves. The gang sets their sights on a bank, but they find it`s already been hit by a thief with a similar idea. And that thief turns out to be Zenigata! Lupin skeptically wonders \"Why the heck is Zenigata acting like me?\" while moving on to target a jewelry store, only to find Zenigata`s already there!\nSource: crunchyroll",
