  "description" : "Arriving back at the lab with Rintaro, Kurisu is met with a strange reaction from Suzuha. While the gang gathering parts needed to connect the IBN 5100 with Daru`s PC, Suzuha warns Rintaro to be cautious of Kurisu. Using the IBN 5100 to decipher SERN`s encrypted files, Rintaro, Daru, and Kurisu learn that various people have been found dead in a gel-like state in various points in time as a result of their experiments. Kurisu deduces that the gelatinous state is the result of matter being squeezed at a molecular level whilst passing through the micro black hole. Despite the shock of this news, Rintaro vows to perfect the PhoneWave. \nSource: Wikipedia",
