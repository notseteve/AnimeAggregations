  "description" : "The Beast Titan sends the smaller Titans inside to kill the horses and cut off the Scouts` only escape route. Erwin has the majority of the squads protect the horses while the Levi and Hange squads tackle the Armored Titan, using Eren as bait to lure him away. The Armored Titan takes the bait, abandoning its target of killing the horses. Eren`s training of hardening his hands pays off in the hand-to-hand combat, and he creates an opening for Hange and her squad to attack with their Thunder Spears, new weapons developed specifically for the Armored Titan. They succeed in blinding him and destroying the nape.",
