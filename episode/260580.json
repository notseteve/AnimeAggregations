  "description" : "\"It must mean people are finally starting to see us as partners.\"\nReiji and Ayumu from ROCK DOWN have been selected as finalists in the running to become brand ambassadors for Illusion Kiss—a new line of products from the Myth Kiss brand of cosmetics. Realizing that earlier Myth Kiss commercials also featured members of Tsukino Productions, and determined not to make their predecessors look bad, the two put their energy into preparing for a final camera test and rehearsal in full costume and makeup, in which Reiji will play a wizard who puts a magical makeup spell on Ayumu. On the day of the test, Ayumu`s makeover transforms him into a stunning beauty who mesmerizes everyone on the set, including Reiji.\nSource: crunchyroll",
