  "description" : "Tsukasa is inconsolable after being rejected by Isla, and none of the efforts of his colleagues to cheer him up seem to work. Michiru tries to talk to Isla and suggests that they live apart for a time so that she can sort out her true feelings about him. They get Tsukasa to live with Zack in Michiru`s place, while Eru and Michiru move in with Isla. Michiru however inadvertently spends the night with Tsukasa and Zack instead, and the next morning they she is seen with Tsukasa, leading Isla to misunderstand and she runs away. Michiru and Tsukasa catch up with her and they talk, and Isla asks that Tsukasa give her time to think things over. Later Michiru talks to Isla more in depth and she realises that Isla really is in love with Tsukasa.\nKazuki hears about the incident and she disbands Isla`s partnership with Tsukasa.",
