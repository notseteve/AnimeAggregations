  "description" : "Despite having a fever, Fushihara is working overtime at the office again today. Taking notice of this, Yuurei-chan yells \"You`re gonna work yourself to death!\" and proceeds to try and persuade Fushihara to leave. When Fushihara tells her that her being there with her motivates her, Yuurei-chan proposes that she go home with her, so that she can finish her work at home. Easily swayed by the ever-so-cute little baby ghost, Fushihara promptly agrees to her proposal and takes her home at once.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
