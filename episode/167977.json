  "description" : "Nanami is flabbergasted as he is made to be captain of a girls` soccer team while Kagami has a team that is one of the top high school teams of the prefecture. Hiiragi acts as referee as the match begins, and while Nanami roughs up Kagami during the game his team manages to consistently score, and the difference in skill between their teams is obvious. Nanami is on the point of quitting, but after Kagami`s repeated jibes is forced to remain in the game, and then Kagami calls Minako over and she reminds him of his training with the computer soccer game. He begins using a \"long ball play\" from video game soccer that should be impossible in real-life soccer, as it requires a player with inhuman speed and strength, but Nanami actually has such ability, and by using this tactic his team manages to win. In this way Kagami manages to help address Nanami`s psychological issues, and earns his respect.",
