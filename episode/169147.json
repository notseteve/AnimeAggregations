  "description" : "Madoka has spent the night in the Kagami house, and her fiancé, Hell Gates, arrives to pick her up. Kagami challenges Gates to a video game duel, saying that he will give up his attempts to acquire KMC and will call off the engagement if he loses, but if he wins, not only will he continue his plans but will furthermore prevent Kagami from laying hands on video games ever again. Kagami chooses the as-yet unreleased King Halo 3, produced by Gates` company, as their game. In preparation for the duel, he has Kiriko and Kanan play King Halo 2, and observes what these two complete amateurs do.\nDuring the duel, Kagami, by replicating the unexpected amateur moves his students were doing manages to trigger several bugs in the game to his advantage and in so doing defeats Gates. Gates admits defeat and abides by the conditions of the duel, but challenges Kagami to a separate duel with King Halo 2, just to salve his pride, but still he is soundly defeated. He then asks Kagami why he doesn`t participate in game tournaments and is told that games are not for competition but for mastery. Gates is even more attracted to Madoka for having the discernment to choose a man like Kagami.",
