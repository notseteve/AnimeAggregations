  "description" : "Yukino makes the decision to be her real self, but her classmates still treat her as a visitor from outside. The other girls mistrust her and spread rumors in the wake of her parents being called in on account of her falling grades, as well as her getting close not only with Arima, but also with Asaba. In the midst of all this, Isawa Maho, who had detected a change in Yukino some time back, takes advantage of the girls` antagonism toward Yukino to take control of them. And what will Yukino do when these moves finally lead to action?\nSource: theTVDB.com",
