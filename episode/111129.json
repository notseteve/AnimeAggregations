At the last minute, Tsukishima guides the woman to safety on the Miracle Train. The woman turns out to be Himero, daughter of an extremely wealthy family, and she has never ridden the subway before. Suspicious of the motives of the men in black and the not entirely truthful Himero, Tsukishima takes her out to explore the area and find answers to his questions.\nSource: crunchyroll",
