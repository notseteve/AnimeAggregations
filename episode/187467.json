  "description" : "Bonobono, Chipmunk and Raccoon have set out for a distant mountain to see a waterfall.  They hop across a river, cross a log bridge, and walk through underbrush to finally reach the great waterfall!  Bonobono finds it quite interesting that the waterfall continues moving even when he is not looking. He thinks the waterfall must get tired having to move even when no one is looking.\nSource: crunchyroll",
