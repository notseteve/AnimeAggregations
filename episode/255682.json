  "description" : "An Alliance relief fleet is finally heading to the Iserlohn Corridor, but combat forces on the battlefield are limited, and a wrong move could turn fatal. Should the Iserlohn garrison fleet be unable to break the blockade imposed by Kempff`s ships, the reinforcements from Heinessen would be easily destroyed. On the command bridge of Iserlohn, Caselnes and his officers animatedly discuss the countermeasures, but what sounds like the best plan comes from somebody most unexpected.\nSource: crunchyroll",
