But is this a date? While Ringo may be the world`s greatest scientist, she`s ignorant and helpless when it comes to romance. She tries consulting her friends on the matter, but it doesn`t help assuage her fears or anxieties. But then Shinobu teaches her a secret plan.\nHow will their date ultimately go?\nSource: crunchyroll",
