  "description" : "Surprised to find Kurisu alive, Rintaro is subsequently humiliated by her during a lecture concerning the unlikeliness of time travel. After getting some provisions from the androgynous Urushibara Ruka, Rintaro meets Amane Suzuha, who is hired by his landlord Yuugo \"Mr. Braun\" Tennouji as a part time assistant in his electronics shop. Later, Rintaro investigates the supposedly altered events and learns that a man calling himself John Titor, who claimed in 2000 that he was a time traveler, has surfaced once more in 2010. Believing this John Titor to be a fake, Rintaro is shocked to find that all evidence of Titor appearing in 2000 have disappeared. The next day, Rintaro encounters a strange woman named Moeka Kiryuu who asks for information on a retro PC model called the IBN 5100, which Rintaro gathers from Daru. Later, as Rintaro and Daru once again experiment with their Phonewave, a banana disappears from the oven and appears reattached to its bunch in gel form, at which point Kurisu arrives at the lab.\nSource: Wikipedia",
