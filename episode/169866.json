  "description" : "The Rose Knights treat Itami very roughly as they bring him back to Italica, so much so that he is knocked unconscious. Pinya is livid, as they have then violated the treaty so soon after it had been agreed upon and she fears that the JSDF will use the incident as a pretext to attack, so she orders Bozes Co Palesti to make it up to Itami with her body. In the meantime, Itami`s platoon sneaks into the city in an attempt to rescue him, to find that he is being well cared for by several semi-human maids and they have a small party. Bozes arrives and slaps Itami after she sees that he seems to be having fun.\nPinya and Bozes join Itami`s group as they return to the camp at Arnus Hill, and along the way they see further evidence of the JSDF`s overwhelming military might as they conduct a training exercise. Pinya speaks to General Hazuma, the commanding general of the JSDF forces at Arnus Hill, apologising for the incident. The next day, she joins Leilei, Tuka, and Rory as part of the delegation from beyond the Gate for the audience with the Diet of Japan.",
