  "description" : "The first half of the Warabis` practice game against Kunogi Academy ends with a score of 0-7. Upon witnessing the high skill level of her opponents, Nozomi is not disheartened, but rather begins to glow with excitement. Nozomi`s play inspires her team to regain their momentum, and though the Warabis are closing in on Kunogi`s goal, the point difference only widens. Meanwhile, Suo is distressed over having her preferred playstyle shut down completely, and Nozomi goes off on her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
