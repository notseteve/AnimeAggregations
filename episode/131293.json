As Rikuo runs ahead, Rihan stops to observe his surroundings; suddenly, the woman stabs him from behind, killing him, while Rikuo can only look on in shock.

In a meeting with the yokai leaders of the Nura Clan, the Supreme Commander made an official announcement, declaring that his grandson would become the next heir; however, Rikuo is against this due to an encounter with his friends, who claimed that all yokai are evil, and upon hearing the evil deeds of the clan leaders towards humans.
