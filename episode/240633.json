  "description" : "The final fight of the qualifier for the tournament has begun. Cestvs` opponent is Felix the professional gladiator, also known as the Red Storm. Felix is confident, repeatedly throwing what appear to be wide swings and calling Cestvs a sucker, as he is well-versed in fighting in cramped arenas. Cestvs attempts to focus on reading his opponent`s attacks, but he suffers damage as he takes blow after blow. Meanwhile, Felix doesn`t miss the change in Cestvs and demonstrates the true strength of the Red Storm.\nSource: crunchyroll",
