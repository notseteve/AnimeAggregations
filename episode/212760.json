  "description" : "Bakemonogani, a crab-like monster devours a man after destroying his boat. Meanwhile the drought in the Daigo worsens, and lord Kagemitsu is advised of the Asakura clan gathering on their border. He visits the temple and finds more demon statues destroyed, and the demons inform him Hyakkimaru is still alive and slowly retrieving his body. His son Tahoumaru also discovers his father is searching for a baby. Later, Tahoumaru and his two bodyguards, Mutsu and Hyogo, encounter a village where they speak of a monster in the lake which eats the fishermen. He leads a group of villagers in their boats onto the lake and attacks and damages the monster, but it is too fierce and they are forced to retreat. Tahoumaru then has the villagers construct a trap, intending to lure the monster into a shallow channel where the water can be drained out. The plan works, and Tahoumaru, Mutsu and Hyogo attack it together. However, the monster fights back and almost devours Hyogo, but at the last minute Hyakkimaru arrives and slays it. Tahoumaru is left wondering who the stranger is.\nSource: Wikipedia",
