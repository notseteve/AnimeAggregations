  "description" : "The world has been almost completely overrun by mysterious monsters known as Aragami. Utsugi Lenka has been chosen to become one of the God Eaters, warriors wielding weapons known as God Arcs, the only weapons effective against the Aragami. Though the base is under attack by Aragami, Lenka and his friend Fujiki Kouta are ordered by their commander Tsubaki to train, which he does gladly, hoping to soon become strong enough to fight the Aragami, though his simulated training is less than successful. Later, the base is under attack from two sides and is nearly overrun, as the remaining defenders are too far away. Lenka asks to join the battle but Tsubaki orders him to stand down. He disobeys, and is nearly killed, losing his God Arc early in the fight. The First Unit, led by Amamiya Lindow, arrive in time and manage to defeat most of the Aragami. Lenka notices one surviving Aragami attacking a woman. Retrieving his God Arc, which initially took the form of a sword, he tries to save her, but he is too far away, however he manages to make it transform into a gun, which he uses to shoot the Aragami. This impresses Lindow and his companions: Lenka is evidently a `new type`.",
