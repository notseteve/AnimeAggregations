  "description" : "The next step for the Naria girls on their road to idol stardom is to do a TV commercial!  But a cunning monster traps them in a hallucination!  The monster makes them think that they`re a traveling conman trying to pass a married woman off as a high-tech maid robot, and a pure boy who`s suspicious, but still can`t refuse because he can`t stop thinking about the maid`s breasts. To get out, they`ll have to pretend to be a store employee trying to sell a cucumber, and cast magic spells to get the hair out of a drain!\nSource: crunchyroll",
