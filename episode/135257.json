  "description" : "Kaito becomes angry when he notices Rook to have done something to Cubic. He and Nonoha go to one of Rook`s old living quarters, where they learn of Rook`s disturbing childhood. After hearing from Nonoha about some ruins where Kaito and Rook used to hang out, Ana goes to investigate and encounters a POG Giver, who presents a maze-type Kenja Puzzle, which Ana solves easily. However, things get hectic when Gammon and Cubic attempt to rescue him, but Ana makes it out okay, retrieving a wooden puzzle Rook made for Kaito, the sight of which also surprises Rook himself.\nSource: Wikipedia",
