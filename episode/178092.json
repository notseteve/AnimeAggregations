  "description" : "It’s the first day of the joint training camp. During dinner, Tsukushi overhears the students from other schools talk about Kazama`s middle school days. Curious about what happened in the past; Tsukushi tries his best to ask his roommate, but can`t quite do it. When Tsukushi wakes up the next morning, Kazama`s missing; apparently he went to train by himself on the pitch.\nSource: crunchyroll",
