  "description" : "Takemoto, Morita, Mayama, and Professor Hanamoto all reminisce about Lohmeyer, a friend of theirs. In a flashback, it is revealed that he is a large, bulky guy, and known for his generosity and his kindness. He brings tons of meat to them, as the four happily ask for more. Until one day, Lohmeyer disappears, leaving the four in major depression and sorrow. In the present, Takemoto and Mayama go to an amusement park. Mayama explains the history and design of the amusement park as well as its mascot, leaving Takemoto in total shock. The suit of the mascot, ironically, was worn by Lohmeyer at the time. Mayama says that Lohmeyer as the mascot attracted many of the adults more than the children, because of his personality. Takemoto then wonders about Lohmeyer as the mascot of the amusement park. However, Takemoto, Hagu, Mayama, and Yamada are surprised to discover that Morita is the new wearer of the suit of the mascot. \nSource: Wikipedia",
