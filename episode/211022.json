  "description" : "During the party at the Rokumeikan, Mei is treated like a suspect by a police officer named Fujita Goro, but Ougai pulls her close and calls Mei his precious fiancée. Having no place to go, Ougai brings her back to his mansion and tells her that she can stay until her memory returns. Mei is being toyed with by Ougai`s gentle alluring words. Meanwhile, Syunso, who is a freeloading art student living at the mansion as well, seems to be troubled by something putting him in a poor mood.\nSource: crunchyroll",
