  "description" : "Lupin is in Monaco to race his new toy in the Monaco Grand Prix. Or so he thought. Lupin ends up losing both his money and race car in a fixed poker game at the casino. Then, Fujiko tells Lupin about a fixed race, suggesting that Lupin should enter it to turn the tables on the man who cheated him, while also stealing the enormous betting takes.
