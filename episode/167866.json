  "description" : "Itou Miyabi eventually convinces the three of them to let her join the club. She turns out to have a bit of a mania about supernatural phenomena and produces a lot of junk that are supposedly supernatural artefacts. Her presence puts a bit of a damper on Yamada and Shiraishi`s plans  to use the club room as a secret place to perform their body swapping. Eventually, however, she catches Yamada and Shiraishi kiss, and infuriated, she begins to spread rumours around the school that the two of them are dating. In an attempt to undo the damage, he tells Itou the truth about the body swap power, and performs it on her to prove it. It turns out that Itou is known for spreading tall tales and no one really believed her. It turns out that she left the school in Yamada`s body in an attempt to intimidate the punks who duped her into buying the fake supernatural artefacts, but it turns out that even in Yamada`s body she is unable to fight them off. Yamada shows up in her body and manages to beat up the punks. This earns him Itou`s gratitude, and her fascination at experiencing a true supernatural phenomenon. She has them experiment systematically with the body swap powers.",
