  "description" : "Kagami has been playing Uroburos Online, a popular MMORPG, under the name \"The First\", with his partner with the name \"Luce\". They have completed all the quests in the game except for one, which requires a team of 35 members in order to perform, and Kagami has the idea of bringing his students into the game to make the required number.\nAt school, after being reluctantly praised by Makina for his efforts so far, but admonished that there are still other truants, he gets everyone to log onto the game, and starts training them in how to play. Later, he realises that they still have only 34 players, including himself and Luce, and Kisaki reminds him that there was one other truant in his class besides her. He logs off and runs to the truant`s house, a boy named Araki Koutarou, and finds to his shock that he is a cross-dressing hikikomori who is none other than his long-time gaming partner Luce.",
