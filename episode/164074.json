  "description" : "As July goes on his pool date with Chifuyu, Madoka tries to concoct a plan to get Chifuyu to hate July. However, July overcomes her expectations each time, leaving Madoka to become impressed by him as well. The next day, Sayumi brings July to the very same pool, where Shizumu equips her with a swimsuit that would allegedly become see-through if she gets wet. Later that night, Tomoyo tries inviting July to the pool, only to learn he is going on a family vacation with Hatoko.\nSource: Wikipedia",
