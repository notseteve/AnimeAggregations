  "description" : "Zoe is stuck in the Water Sphere, where she has a flashback about being teased. She soon finds a group of Honeybeemon who are attempting to capture her for Ranamon. Ranamon later forces them to feed Zoe an apple that causes nightmare visions. When she breaks the spell, she and Ranamon wind up digivolving into their Beast forms. Zoe destroys Ranamon and collects both her spirits before she is freed. Meanwhile, Takuya wanders into the Thunder Sphere, where he encounters Parrotmon, and J.P. gets lost in the Wood Sphere, where he finds Cherrymon but both the boys manage to defeat their opponents with ease.\nSource: crunchyroll",
