  "description" : "After Sakura’s battle ends, Teruto announces that it is his turn to face Kikka. Kikka is overcome with joy when Teruto says that this is no longer a Rebuild Battle, but a fight between brother and sister. Nothing brings more excitement to Kikka than taking on Teruto in a Build-Divide battle, and they begin their match while Hiyori and Naomitsu watch on. But there is someone in the shadows who is enjoying the battle more than anyone else. That would be Mario Higuma, who observes the battle with a malicious smile. He is the King’s attendant but appears to have an ulterior motive…What is the truth of Neo Kyoto and what are Higuma’s intentions?\nSource: crunchyroll",
