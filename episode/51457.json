  "description" : "Tetsuro and Maetel met a girl named Neko while chasing Catroids. She is hiding Meow, the leader of the Catroids, from the police. She then tells Tetsuro, in tears, about the atrocities being committed by the police on the planet. The police wanted to force everyone to become cyborgs. They set up a trap in a sushi restaurant, captured people there, and converted each one to having a mechanical body. Both Neko and Meow fell victim to this plot so they are using the skills of the Flying Kuros to sniff out humans.\nSource: crunchyroll",
