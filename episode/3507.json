  "description" : "With just one day left in her summer break, Sakura had repeated her mistake from last year- she still had a mountain of homework to get through! I decided to invite her to go to the library so that we could finish our homework together, but Sakura couldn`t seem to find the book she needed for her book report. We did manage to track it down, but just as we reached for it, the Move card transported it to another spot! And it did that again and again and again... Eventually, we ran into Xiaolang, and the two of them desperately chased after the book. Just as Sakura got her hands on it, she suddenly fell into a nearby stream. Soaked, she went to Xiaolang`s apartment and changed into a spare shirt of his. Just then, Xiaolang`s fiance (and cousin) Meiling burst through the door, spotted Sakura wearing the shirt that she had given Xiaolang as a present, and flew into an energetic rage! So much excitement for one day!\nSource: crunchyroll",
