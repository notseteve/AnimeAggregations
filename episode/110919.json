  "description" : "After finding Noei’s hideout, Quinza sends out the secret police to the hideout in order to use Noei for his plan. On the other hand, Noei senses danger and plans to move his hideout, though the men from the palace arrive at the hideout sooner than he had expected.  Using the underground waterway, everyone from the hideout escapes, though Kajika notices that Noei is not among them. Kajika feels a sense of guilt when she learns that it was Noei’s plan to diverge the enemy’s attention while everyone else escaped. Suddenly, more of the men from the palace catch up to them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
