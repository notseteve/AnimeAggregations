  "description" : "Love Rice managed to overcome their crisis thanks to Chinkobozu`s Harvest Show. Rain suddenly started to fall as Love Rice made their return to the Harvest Festival venue. Will the wishes of Hinohikari, Sasanishiki, Hitomebore, Akitakomachi, and Nikomaru to restore the popularity of rice and keep the school open be granted? Can rice defeat bread? This emotional Love Kome-dy is about to reach its conclusion!\nLove Rice is forced to begin their Harvest Show without Hitomebore, but Yeast King sees that they`re not performing at their full potential and stops them. The members of Yeast King feel ashamed of everything they`ve done to stand in Love Rice`s way, and even more so when they find out who was behind Hitomebore`s dilemma, so they offer to help. The desire to present their Harvest Shows fair and square leads to the sprouting of friendship between the two rival grains.\nSource: crunchyroll",
