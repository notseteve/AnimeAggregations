  "description" : "Uryu`s days of training pay off as he is able to protect Orihime and himself from Jirobo and his zanpaku-to, known as Tsunzaki Garasu.   Ganju and Ichigo finally run into each other, but each brings with them a trail of angry Soul Reapers.  Their attempt to hold the weak and unappreciated Hanataro hostage fails when they learn that he is a member of the weakest squad.  Meanwhile, Captain Kurotsuchi questions Ikkaku about the intruding Ryoka with no success.  However, when Captain Zaraki arrives, Ikkaku`s tongue begins to loosen.\nSource: crunchyroll",
