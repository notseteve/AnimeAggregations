  "description" : "This time it`s a business trip to Nagoya. There, they are greeted by Hokosu Shachi, the member of the Seven Gods of Suits forcing everyone to cut back in rash ways. When confronted, Hokosu says, \"If you beat me, I`ll let you take my daughter!\" The fight proceeds with a special rule where you gain battle money by proposing good ways to be frugal. Kaito is useless this time around, so Mitsuo takes his place and joins the battle with his eye on marrying into riches!\nSource: crunchyroll",
