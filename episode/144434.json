  "description" : "Yashio Kaito and his friend Senomiya Akiho are the remaining members of their school`s Robotics Club. After Akiho hands in a budget request to the staff room, both she and Kaito, who spends his time playing games on his Poke-Com device, visit an old hangar containing a large robot the Robotics Club has been working on since its foundation, GunBuild-1, based on a popular robot anime, \"Gunvarrel\", whose final episode was never aired. The next day, the vice-principal agrees to give the Robotics Club their proposed budget on the condition that they win a robot tournament taking place in two weeks` time, with the club to be disbanded should they lose. As Kaito and Akiho contemplate if they can pull off such a feat, a mysterious girl is seen making a report. \nSource: Wikipedia",
