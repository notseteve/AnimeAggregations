But before long, Hack is apprehended by the customer center, who are investigating the Zero Phenomenon. The next day, Berry wakes up on the veranda of her apartment, and after trying to explain what happened, her friends point out to her that there is no evidence of Zero Phenomenon having occurred, much less of the kid she encountered. Not taking no for an answer, Berry decides to dig up proof behind the Zero Phenomenon.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
