When they are boggled by how much they don`t know, Super Idol Kikuko`s manager, Mana-chan, appears before them. She says they are missing a promoter who will make all the arrangements for her concerts, and announces that she will take the job. Next, she claims she will need another 700 million yen. Unable to come up with that much money, Miss Monochrome goes to a certain mountain pass to search for a promoter on her own.\nSource: crunchyroll",
