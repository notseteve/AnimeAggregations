  "description" : "Meiling`s mother called to tell her she needed to go back to Hong Kong. Meiliing was pretty upset because Xiaolang didn`t seem concerned that she was leaving, but he said he just realized that there was no point in fighting it. The Twin Card made an appearance that night and started making doubles of everything, even Mr. Wei! Sakura and Xiaolang tried to capture them, but since they weren`t in perfect unison, it didn`t work! It`s a good thing Meiling and Xiaolang trained together so much, because they were able to kick the Twins` butts and let Sakura seal them away! Too bad Meiling still had to go home to Hong Kong, but at least she had made up with Xiaolang.\nSource: crunchyroll",
