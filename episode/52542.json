  "description" : "When the Ham-Hams decide what to play, Cappy wants to play hide and seek, but he speaks so quietly, no one can hear him, and they go with Panda`s idea of playing dodgeball instead. While Boss is looking for the ball, Cappy asks about Boss`s tunnel. Boss says that it continues forever, and no matter how far you walk, you`ll have to walk even farther. Cappy is sad until Stucky shows up. They both decide to play hide and seek in the tunnel. They have a lot of fun, until an earthquake traps them! \nSource: Wikipedia",
