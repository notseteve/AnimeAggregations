  "description" : "Fujimaru recalls his journeys in the other Singularities, particularly the regret he feels for those he could not save, who then suffered at the hands of the King of Mages. Even still, Fujimaru finds himself questioning his own decisions. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh dispatches him to investigate the city of Ur under royal orders. While traveling to their destination, the group comes under attack by a creature striking out of the blisteringly hot depths of the jungle! Though nearly led astray by their attacker and the constant battles, Fujimaru and company arrive safely in Ur. There, they are astonished to find that, contrary to what they had been led to believe, the citizens of Ur lead quiet lives. However, that peace hides a secret... Ultimately, Fujimaru is forced to make a difficult choice.\nSource: crunchyroll",
