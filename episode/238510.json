  "description" : "A shot from Nozomi`s right foot shakes the net of Kunogi Academy`s goal. However, her magnificent goal that surprised everyone present is invalidated by a foul committed by her teammate Aya Shiratori. Meanwhile, the whistle announcing the end of the game sounds, resulting in a massive defeat of 0-21.
