  "description" : "Sick and tired of Oiwa’s tyranny, Gintoki decides to shut down the inn by teaming up with Rei. He plans to use Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Mitsuhide (their stands, that is) to bring down the inn’s reputation but is stopped by Okami Otose. Though overwhelmed at first by Okami’s most powerful stand Tagosaku, Gintoki nonetheless manages to exorcize the inn’s customers with the help of Shinpachi and the gang, who are now themselves living stands. With the fate of the inn and himself at stake, Gintoki finally enters a one-on-one battle with Oiwa.\nSource: crunchyroll",
