  "description" : "As Kaito has some alone time following his match, where he recalls more about his past, Ana talks with Nonoha about his sister, Eve, who helped cheer him up when he was down. As the game resumes, with another loss resulting in a team loss, Ana faces off against Mizerka. As Mizerka becomes annoyed by how much of a free spirit Ana is, Nonoha shows Kaito a chalk drawing Ana drew, based on a painting Eve did for him. Firm in his belief in Kaito, Ana manages to win his round. Afterwards, Kaito gives his thanks to Ana, who suggests he try and do the same thing for Freecell.\nSource: Wikipedia",
