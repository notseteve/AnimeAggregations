  "description" : "Yoruichi trains Ichigo, educating him about the potential to transcribe a zanpaku-to`s main form and materialize it.  He is moving toward bankai training from the shikai training of dialogue and harmonization, and to do so he must face and conquer difficult challenges set forth by Zangetsu.   Uryu, Ganju, and Chad are reunited in a shared prison cell, where they wonder why their wounds have been treated and they haven`t been killed.  Orihime has also been captured and kept alive, although she is in a different holding location.\nSource: crunchyroll",
