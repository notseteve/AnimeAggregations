  "description" : "The Seirin-Kaijo match heats up with an ace showdown. The tables turn, and Seirin takes the offensive. The final awakened one whose abilities rival the Generation of Miracles... Kagami`s talents begin to blossom. Kise senses the threat more keenly than anyone else, but it gives him all the more reason not to lose! However, Kise`s injured foot takes a turn for a worse, and he`s forced to retreat to the bench. Seirin suddenly seems to take control of the game, but without their ace, Kaijo comes together and digs in their heels. Finally, Kasamatsu beats Kuroko`s Phantom Shot that even Murasakibara couldn`t stop!\nSource: crunchyroll",
