Erika learns of thoughts and feelings she didn`t know her mother had.\nAfter making contact with Mikado and the others, Erika tells them that she wants Sensei to stop doing the work they do, not just herself. Mikado decides to help, but it seems that Hiyakawa can`t understand Erika and Mikado`s feelings.\nSource: crunchyroll",
