  "description" : "Ledo is in a state of shock over the revelation of the Hideauze origin, while Chamber is unperturbed and seeks to continue their mission of slaughter. Meanwhile, power quickly goes to Pinion`s head. After recovering an abundance of treasure and ancient weaponry from the decimated whalesquid nest, he broadcasts a threat to all ships in the area, basically saying \"approach and be sunk\". But that doesn`t deter pirates from zeroing in on the small fleet.\nSource: crunchyroll",
