  "description" : "The always-energetic Yumoto is sighing, which takes the other Defense Club members aback! It seems an old amusement park he used to go to, Binan Land, is closing. The other Defense Club members aren`t too surprised, saying \"it was a pretty sad place\" and \"Every couple that`s gone there has broken up,\" but Yumoto is truly despondent at the thought of losing a place he used to go to with his big brother. The others can`t stand to watch him looking so down, so they pool their money to give Yumoto one last trip to Binan Land.\nSource: crunchyroll",
