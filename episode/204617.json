  "description" : "After finally escaping from the garbage field, Midge and the others once more set a course for Earth. While on their journey, they come across another space station just drifting through space. They decide to board it to see what kind of food or other bugs might be onboard, but are chased by the frogs who are hot on their trail. Just when things are looking bleak, the gang is saved by a house mouse who lives on the station. The mice are experimental creatures, much like Midge and his friends, and have met the same predicament where they were suddenly abandoned by the humans. Everything seems pleasant on the surface, but the mice are hiding a dark secret.\nSource: crunchyroll",
