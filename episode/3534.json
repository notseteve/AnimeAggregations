  "description" : "Sakura got everyone Christmas presents except Yukito... It`s so hard to decide what to get someone you like that much! After some advice from Meiling, she invited Yukito to the amusement park to give him his gift. Of course, I couldn`t miss filming her romantic date, so Kero and I snuck after them. I guess everyone likes the amusement park, because while they were there, they ran into Xiaolang, Meiling, and even Toya (working, of course). Things started getting hot when everything burst into flame! It was the Firey card! I missed filming Sakura`s daring capture since Xiaolang used the Time card and Sakura put everyone to sleep with the Sleep card. After she captured Firey using Windy and Watery at the same time, they all took a ride on the Ferris wheel. While they were on it, Sakura gave Yukito his gift, and Kero used his power to make the whole sky glitter! It was so beautiful!\nSource: crunchyroll",
