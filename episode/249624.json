  "description" : "Fuyuko, one of Kanade`s underlings, is a researcher who develops killer viruses. Fuyuko threatens Mirai and his companions by telling them that she`ll conduct an indiscriminate terrorist act and spread her killer virus. She demands that they allow her to test her newest drug on them if they want to prevent the attack. Kanade names Mirai as the first guinea pig. Mukaido and Saki desperately try to stop him, but Mirai won`t listen, as he doesn`t want anyone to die, and instead he faces Fuyuko one on one. The needle approaches. What will be Mirai`s fate...?\nSource: crunchyroll",
