  "description" : "Gamma rescues Yuni, who was captured by Torikabuto. Despite having fought Gokudera and the others as leader of the Millefiore, Gamma is now here only for the sake of protecting his boss, Yuni. Even Nosaru and Tazaru are happy to serve Yuni in combat. But Gamma can’t exercise his full power potential because his Mare Ring was stolen. Gamma still puts himself on the line and does everything within his power to protect Yuni. Torikabuto draws near to Gamma and Yuni, and just then, Tsuna appears before them!\nSource: crunchyroll",
