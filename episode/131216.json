Before they can divide the crab`s legs to themselves, suddenly, there came a blackout after the electricity came back one leg is missing and Gintoki ate it. Another blackout came and another leg was missing and Kagura ate it, saying she was attacked by a gorilla. Shinpachi then put up a candle. Then Gintoki and Kagura ate all of the legs. When Shinpachi claims the crab`s whole body they found themselves fighting for a crab congee and ended up eating crab-flavored cheap food.",
