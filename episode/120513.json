  "description" : "With the help of Uri, Gokudera hits Zakuro with one solid attack. But just then, Bluebell shows up to fight him too! Gokudera doesn’t have the strength left in him to move, let alone fight another battle. As Bluebell is about to finish him off, Gokudera gets backup from someone unexpected. Meanwhile, Kikyo comes to the marsh where Ryohei, Basil, Lambo, Nosaru, and Tazaru are hiding. These battles between the Millefiore and Vongola will require a lot from everyone involved!\nSource: crunchyroll",
