  "description" : "\"Today you won`t beat me.\" \"...I could say the same thing.\"\nSera Rikka and Murase Dai are chosen to play characters to promote women`s cosmetics. The theme of the commercial is a princess and her knight. Dai, who already feels he`s not good at working in front of a camera, begins to feel the pressure when he learns he`ll be working with cosmetics, a product he has no experience with, alongside former model Rikka, who completes any and all shoots with ease. Will they be able to finish filming the commercial without incident...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
