  "description" : "Gabriel hears that her older sister is heading to Earth and seems troubled. Which really comes as no surprise, as her older sister, Zelel, is known to be very efficient in Heaven. She’s a very powerful angel, who is known to be serious and strict, and is referred to as the Hand of God. Gabriel starts panicking, thinking that she might get such a harsh punishment if she finds out that she’s fallen that the world might be destroyed. Will Gabriel be able to get through in one piece?\nSource: crunchyroll",
