  "description" : "Cygnus and Shun attempt to fight the eerie gold saint Gemini, but every attack they can muster is repeatedly shot back in their faces. It appears that Gemini is actually an illusion being controlled from far away, so they are actually attacking nothing. Meanwhile, Seiya and Shiryu are figuring this out for themselves in another area of the house, but Shiryuusing his sixth sense, since he`s still blind-leads Seiya through the illusions and out of the Gemini house towards the Cancer house. Angered by his lack of foresight (Shiryu not being able to see, thus the illusion not affecting him), ArIes, who was in fact creating the illusions from afar, uses all of his mighty powers to attack Shun and Cygnus. ArIes sends Cygnus spinning into another dimension and leaves Shun hanging on for dear life!\nSource: crunchyroll",
