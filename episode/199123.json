  "description" : "The Build Divers decide to participate in a Battle-Random mission in which the matchups are randomly determined. Their opponent turns out to be a force called Hyakki, which includes Do-ji, against whom Riku won his first victory, and Ogre, who gave him his first taste of defeat. Riku`s heart pounds with anticipation at the idea of assessing his growth by taking on Ogre, using the strength he`s accumulated through his previous experiences. Meanwhile, Do-ji`s own heart burns with desire for revenge.\nSource: crunchyroll",
