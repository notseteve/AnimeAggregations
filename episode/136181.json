  "description" : "The Flame Haze army retreats as the Snake of the Festival destroys their morale. He announces his plan to create a new world, a complete copy of ours, to be a paradise for Denizens and with Power of Existence flowing everywhere. Thus, all Denizens would leave the world and the Flame Hazes would stop fighting against them. After that, panic and chaos reigns among the Flame Hazes, who now do not have a purpose and the Denizens attack them. Sophie and François Auric try to ease the chaos despite their hopeless efforts.\nSource: Wiki",
