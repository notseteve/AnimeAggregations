  "description" : "Leicester and the rest of Oasis search the city to try to find Minette. Carina and Leicester are the first to find Aberdeen`s home. They are attacked by Avril, but Carina uses a spell to send Leicester ahead to the house while she fights Avril. He confronts Aberdeen and they do battle, and after Leicester makes his weapon produce an explosion that sends both of them reeling convinces him that there has to be another way, a way to save Miriam without needing to sacrifice Minette.\nThe Tortilla sisters return to Ert`Aria to report their findings to Oasis, of how there was a great explosion of light at the mountain and many crystal monsters suddenly appeared and began to attack. The Waterwheel of the Heavens must be nearby they reason, and they realise that if something is not done soon to stabilise the flow of Ale there will be a cataclysm of apocalyptic proportions. Oasis, Aberdeen, and Avril make their way there while the Tortillas remain to help the Archduke and Nagan to defend the city from the approaching wave of crystal monsters.",
