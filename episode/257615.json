  "description" : "Michio`s party arrives in the town of Quratar located near the Imperial City famous for its large labyrinth. Due to its location, many Explorers live in the town, and it seems like a good base of operations for future adventuring. If they could just find a quiet reasonably-priced detached home... Then Michio could enjoy his life with Roxanne even more!\nSource: crunchyroll",
