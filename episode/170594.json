  "description" : "The American paramilitary officers approach the Hakone resort unchallenged, only to find that there are also Russian and Chinese paramilitaries there, apparently on the same mission. A bloodbath ensues when Rory joins the fray, and eventually all of the invaders are killed. Itami`s party escapes by commandeering the van used by the American paramilitaries, and they drive back to Tokyo. Itami`s ex-wife Risa spreads the word that the girls will be heading back through the Gate that afternoon, so a large crowd gathers at Ginza to see them off.\nMeanwhile, the Prime Minister has resigned, removing the blackmail leverage that the Americans had, but the Central Intelligence Agency is still attempting to abduct the girls, planning to take them just as they arrive at Ginza, since the assurances of the previous administration should still hold. However, Komakado has arrested all the foreign intelligence agents in the area, including the CIA ones, saying that he has no way of verifying whether any such agent he finds is with the CIA or not, foiling their plans. Itami`s party thus returns to the Special Region unmolested.",
