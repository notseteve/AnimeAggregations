  "description" : "Ever since episode eight, Akari has been increasingly concerned that all her special shared moments with Hiroyuki seem to mean nothing to him. Does he even remember the incident by the stone steps? And now Shiho seems to be making a play for him! With the worst possible timing, Akari gets confined to bed with a cold. When Shiho comes to visit, Akari puts her on the spot by asking if she`s in love with Hiroyuki. Caught off-guard, Shiho is in a quandary and realizes she must choose between Akari`s feelings and her own.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
