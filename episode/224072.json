  "description" : "Ash is attending the opening of Professor Cerise’s new research laboratory in Vermilion City, but the day’s events take an unexpected turn when the Legendary Pokémon Lugia appears nearby! Ash rushes to battle it, but when he jumps onto the massive Pokémon’s back, he finds he’s not alone! A boy named Goh is there, too, documenting everything he can about Lugia. The Pokémon takes Ash and Goh on an amazing adventure, with Goh capturing it all on camera. Professor Cerise is so impressed with the results, he offers Ash and Goh positions as research fellows at the lab—which they both gladly accept!\nSource: Official Website",
