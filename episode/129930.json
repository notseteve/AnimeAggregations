  "description" : "Ganta becomes angry at Shiro for throwing away the data chip, telling her he never wants to see her again. Meanwhile, Mikuni investigates Tamaki`s office, overhearing a conversation between him and the Defense secretary concerning the Deadmen. As Karako and the others discuss their next plan, Rokuro appears and reveals the data chip was actually a bomb he had made before announcing that the group is being held hostage unless Nagi agrees to become an Undertaker. As Rokuro decides to execute Ganta first, Crow appears on the scene, managing to fight back against the Undertakers using sonic blasts. As Shiro laments her situation with Ganta, she meets Toto \"Mockingbird\" Sakigami, the one who told her about the bomb.",
