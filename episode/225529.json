  "description" : "The Shadow Palace begins to shatter, but Asta and the others manage to escape. Meanwhile, the elves continued to attack the kingdom because they still didn’t know the truth. Asta is the only one who can undo the resurrection, but it won’t be easy to save all of them at once. Patry then frees Vangeance, who’s sleeping inside him, so he can use his world tree magic and Licht can use his magic that connects him with all of the elves and Asta is able to undo the resurrection of all the elves at once. Finally, the long battle is coming to an end.\nSource: crunchyroll",
