  "description" : "Haruhi starts the SOS Brigade with four members: Kyon, Yuki Nagato, Mikuru Asahina, and herself. Haruhi begins to improve the club room`s appearance, but still feels that it is missing something—a computer. Going next door to the Computer Society`s clubroom, Haruhi manages to obtain a computer through forcing the leader to grab Mikuru`s breast and takes pictures saying if they do not give her a computer she will tell everyone they sexually harassed her friend. She enlists the help of Mikuru to help promote the SOS Brigade by dressing up as a bunny girl and handing out fliers. Later, Yuki invites Kyon to her apartment, where she begins to unveil a secret about Haruhi and herself.",
