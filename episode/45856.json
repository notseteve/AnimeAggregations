  "description" : "In the first story, Arale tries out for various clubs at Penguin Village middle-school, but ends up over-excelling in all of them. Which club will she ultimately choose?\nIn the second story, Arale tells Senbei she`s missing a vital part of her body that the other girls in her class had, and she wants the doctor to make one for her. However, Senbei has never seen a lady`s private parts before, so he doesn`t have any reference to use to create any for Arale. Thus, he invents x-ray goggles which allow the wearer to see only living matter, meaning one can see through a person`s clothes. Senbei uses this invention to conduct research on some women in the park. In the end, it turns out the body part Arale was talking about was actually a belly button.",
