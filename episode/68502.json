  "description" : "The Soul Reapers receive permission from the Soul Society to use Gentei Kaijo, a spiritual pressure restriction release. Soul Reaper Captains and Lieutenants have their spiritual pressure limited when they leave the Soul Society so as not to affect the spirits of the World of the Living unnecessarily. In other words, Hitsugaya and the other Soul Reapers have been fighting the Arrancars with only a fifth of their power. The Arrancars recoil at the sudden jump in spiritual pressure and decide to retreat but the Advance Troops pursue them with their attacks.\nSource: crunchyroll",
