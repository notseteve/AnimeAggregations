  "description" : "The sextuplets recieve a birthday party invitation from their childhood friend, Hatabou. They wonder how he`s been lately since they hadn`t seen him in years and receive a shock when they go to his current residence. Everyone`s idol Iyami has lost his job and can`t seem to catch a break with gambling ever since he came back from France (at least, he says he`s from France). To make things worse, he ends up chipping his treasured overbite... However this leads to some unlikely consequences.\nSource: crunchyroll",
