  "description" : "While on the way to the Rose Morning Star, our heroes got dumped at the Dark Gate, the creepy entrance to the Continent of Darkness. Meanwhile, Cherubimon called a meeting of the Legendary Lunkheads. After a little encouragement, Arbormon decided it was time to get rid of the gang once and for all but the Warrior of Wood was no match for our heroes. They chopped him down and stole his Beast Spirit. Then, out of nowhere, Duskmon showed up and destroyed Arbormon.\nSource: crunchyroll",
