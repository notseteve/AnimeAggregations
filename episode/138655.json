  "description" : "One of Lee`s teammates is Hyuuga Neji, a talented ninja who many refer to as a genius.  So talented in fact, that he took out an enemy boss from the Hidden Grass Village in one strike!  Frustrated, Lee challenges Neji, hoping to prove that with enough hard work, a genius can be defeated!\nThere`s one thing Tenten can`t stand, and that`s her teammates Lee and Neji not treating her like a woman.  Just as she`s getting mad, they encounter a female bandit and her gand and the two of them attempt tp protect the leader from her underlings.  All Tenten wants is for her teammates to notice that she`s a girl, too!\nSource: crunchyroll",
