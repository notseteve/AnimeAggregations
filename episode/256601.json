  "description" : "The city falls along with the deformed Sillies and the robot soldiers affected by the bugs’ rampage. As the situation gets chaotic, Nega-Weiss shows up with a giant statute of Nicholas, capturing the Sillies one after another. Although Jaune bravely confronts the statue of Jacques, who is wearing armor that’s reminiscent of Grimm “Geist”, he and Pyrrha, a resident of the dream, are captured. Meanwhile, Ruby’s party manages to reach the core of the dream where the “Nightmare” had rooted, but Nega-Weiss stands in their way. Yang and Blake are swallowed into the glyphs and disappear.\nSource: crunchyroll",
