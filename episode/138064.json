  "description" : "During elementary school, Takakamo Shizuno and Atarashi Ako make friends with the recently transferred Haramura Nodoka. Upon hearing about her interest in mahjong, Shizuno and Ako take Nodoka to Achiga Girl`s Academy, where she meets Akado Harue who runs a mahjong club for children. Nodoka starts playing mahjong with the others, including the clubs top player, Matsumi Kuro. Shizuno later explains to Nodoka how Harue was Achiga`s ace mahjong player, who ended up quitting after being defeated in a tournament, leading to the main club being disbanded. As time passes, Harue is scouted for a company`s mahjong team which leads to the closure of the children`s club. As Shizuno and Nodoka enter Achiga upon reaching middle school, Nodoka reveals she is going to be transferred the next spring. As the years pass, Shizuno, now in her third year, sees Nodoka on television winning the individual tournament. Wanting to reach the inter-high national tournament, Shizuno goes to Achiga`s club room where she encounters Kuro and decides to revive the mahjong club so she can meet Nodoka again. Upon hearing of this, Ako, who had went to a different middle school, decides she wants to enroll into Achiga and join the club.\nSource: Wikipedia",
