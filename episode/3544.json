  "description" : "Ahh, school fairs are just the best! While Toya was busy getting ready for the school play, Yukito showed us around and then took us to the gym before the big performance. Onstage, Toya played the part of Cinderella, and he was just incredible. But suddenly... the Mist card appeared and the set began to crumble away! As the upper part of the stage began to collapse, Toya`s co-star Yoko (who also had a crush on him) took a tumble. Toya managed to grab her hand, but had to hang on for dear life to keep from dropping her! Sakura managed to seal the card away, saving Toya and Yoko in the nick of time. As the fair drew to a close, Yoko confessed her feelings to Toya, but he had to turn her away. She had half-expected that kind of answer, and after recovering she asked him to at least join her in a single dance. So romantic!\nSource: crunchyroll",
