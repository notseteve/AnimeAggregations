  "description" : "When Takuya Beast Spirit Evolved to BurningGreymon, he couldn’t control himself. So Beetlemon & KendoGarurumon tried to help him but were pretty useless. It finally took a lot of reasoning from little Tommy to get Takuya to tame the Beast within. Then the gang got stuck in the mud and Grumblemon showed up to grab Tommy. So Takuya Beast Spirit Evolved and did some grabbing of his own. He took Gigasmon`s Spirit and returned Kumamon`s to Tommy. Grumblemon escaped and met up with the Evil Legendary Warriors (Ranamon, Mercurymon, Arbormon, Duskmon).\nSource: crunchyroll",
