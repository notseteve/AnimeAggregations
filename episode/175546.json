  "description" : "Sasaki visits Shirayuki to inform her that she dons the official title of \"friend of the crown\" of Tanbarun. Afterwards, Prince Izana questions her, asking about her intentions with Zen, and she find herself speechless. Shirayuki struggles to make up her mind as to what she wants in regards to her relationship with Zen, and while she does that, Sasaki tries to convince her to take Raj`s hand. She politely refuses. She finds herself out and about and finally makes up her mind at the bottom of a staircase. She abruptly asks Obi to help her find Zen, and Zen comes running. She runs up to meet him halfway on the staircase and asks if it`s okay that she wishes to be his wife one day. Zen kisses her and she gets so weak in the legs that she cannot walk. Zen carries her to the roof of the castle, where she admires the view. He remembers that he never actually answered her question, so he clearly tells her that he has informed Prince Izana of his feelings towards her, and that he wants her to wait for her, even if it`s selfish of him. They meet up with Obi, Mitsuhide, and Kiki and everyone goes to wish Sasaki off as he leaves Clarines to return to Tanbarun.\nSource: Wikipedia",
