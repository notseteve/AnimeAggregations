  "description" : "Every year the second years participate in the \"workplace experience.\"\nWhen the boys discover the Hidamari Kindergarten they attended is on the list, they all agree to visit. While the boys have not visited in a while, the place has not changed. Shun and the others feel nostalgic, and Kaname feels nervous at the thought of meeting Kaori-sensei again. As Chizuru observes the scene, an acorn falls directly on his head! Terrorized by the brats Ken-chan and Sono-chan, will the boys finish their workplace experience without any trouble?\nSource: crunchyroll",
