With Shaiapouf and Menthuthuyoupi by his side, he returns to the palace to regain his memories. Pouf believes that as a Royal Guard who must carry out the will of the Queen, the King is better off not remember Komugi, so he sends his clones back to the palace to find Komugi and eliminate her. He soon comes across Killua standing on the wall of the palace with Komugi on his back.\nSource: crunchyroll",
