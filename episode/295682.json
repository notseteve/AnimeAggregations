  "description" : "In the northern most reaches of a forbidden land, lies the Nation of Dogmatika. Its people, marked by the sacred stigmata bestowed by High Priest Maximus, live beneath the unwavering rule of divine doctrine. Receiving the High Priest`s blessing on that day was Ecclesia, the \"Most Virtuous,\" the only one in history to bear the stigmata on her forehead. After the ceremony, Ecclesia stood alongside the previous Virtuous Vestal, \"Fleurdelis,\" speaking in earnest about what`s to come ― when suddenly, the skies above Dogmatika split open. From the rift emerged a beast thought to exist only in legend ― a dragon.\nAmid the flames of war, a fallen dragon boy and a wary girl cross paths. From their fated encounter begins the tale of the fallen and the virtuous.\nSource: Official website",
