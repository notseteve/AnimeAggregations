  "description" : "Anna has been receiving letters from a stalker, but she keeps this secret from the rest of the council, although everyone can tell that she is troubled by something. Saotome, the much-admired artist of the school, tears up an award she has been given. She blackmails Tanikuchi into cooperating with her plans to get closer to someone she loves, as she saw him remove his disguise after the last terrorist incident. She confesses that she loves Anna as well, forcing Tanikuchi to tell her that he loves Ayame instead. Ayame comes up with a plan to catch Anna`s stalker, by posing as her boyfriend and provoking the stalker into revealing himself, with Gouriki watching ready to apprehend the stalkers should they arrive. Both Tanikuchi and Saotome are also watching on the sidelines. The plan works, and the stalker reveals himself, and Ayame manages to subdue him, but there are two more stalkers present. Tanikuchi manages to subdue one them but is struck in the process, and as he falls he lands on top of Anna and winds up kissing her. He is badly injured, but Anna is deeply affected by the kiss.",
