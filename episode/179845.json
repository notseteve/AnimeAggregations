  "description" : "As Full Frontal attempts to seize Laplace`s Box, Gael`s Silver Bullet stands in his way, only to be crushed by Frontal`s overwhelmingly superior firepower. Seeing Gael`s plight, Banagher summons the Unicorn Gundam. Riddhe also joins the fight with his Banshee Norn, and the two Gundams confront the huge mobile armor Neo Zeong. However, Frontal uses the Neo Zeong`s psycho-shards to destroy all of the Gundams` weapons. Luring Banagher to the end of space and time, he tries to plant the seeds of nihilism and despair. But Banagher refuses to give up, and he is aided by the thoughts of Lalah and others. In response, the Neo Zeong begins to self-destruct. Meanwhile, Ronan decides to use the colony laser to consign the Box to oblivion, and approves its activation.\nSource: crunchyroll",
