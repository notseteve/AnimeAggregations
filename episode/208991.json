  "description" : "Safely back on the Stork, Midge and the others resume course for Earth. Unfortunately, there is damage to the outer hull of the ship that Midge and Doc have to go repair. While making their repairs, Doc`s bot is crashed into by a space drone carrying a mysterious package. Midge and Doc take the package back inside the ship and the group decides to open it. Inside they find what looks to be a strange seed. Hoping that it will grow and produce food, the group places it under a warm light. They are surprised when Claudia and Jose pop out from the seed. Claudia and Jose explain that they were on their way to Planet Yellow where there is a seed storehouse to hopefully find more seeds to start a family. Ellen and the others agree to help their new friends to their destination.\nSource: crunchyroll",
