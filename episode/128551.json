  "description" : "Kinji is walking down the street, reminiscing about the fate of his brother, who had also been a Butei, who was killed in a maritime hijacking incident that he later learns was also the work of the Butei Killer. He sees Aria in the street and follows her, but she catches him, and tells him to come with him. She goes to a police station where her mother is being held, suspected as the Butei Killer. She urges Aria to find a good partner as she cannot handle the true Butei Killer alone. Kinji later hears that Aria is leaving Japan on a chartered flight to London. He goes to a karaoke bar with Riko, who proceeds to seduce him, activating his Hysteria Mode briefly, and he deduces from what she tells him that Aria is in danger. He rushes to the airport, boards the plane, and as he expected the plane is hijacked by the Butei Killer, who turns out to be none other than Riko herself. She reveals that she is the fourth lineal descendant of Arsène Lupin, the famed master thief, just as Aria is the fourth descendant of his arch-nemesis Sherlock Holmes, and that she staged all of the Butei Killer incidents and tried to bring Kinji and Aria together, so that she could prove that she was better than her famous ancestor. Aria and Riko fight, but Riko manages to shoot Aria in the chest.",
