  "description" : "Gintama is celebrating its half-year run on the air! And so the Odd Jobs trio attempts to kill some time by airing some re-caps. But their true intentions are to draw away the others’ attention and eat as much meat as possible from the sukiyaki meal before them. Trying to read each other’s next moves, Gintoki and Shinpachi successfully trick Kagura and chow down, only to spill the pot all over the place. Realizing she’s been tricked, Kagura begins arguing with Gintoki. Amidst this gloomy atmosphere Shinpachi believes that in order to avoid another messy tragedy, it is imperative to secure the meat’s safety first. And at that moment another pot challenger arrives… with the battle for meat taking yet another turn for the chaotic.\nSource: crunchyroll",
