  "description" : "The legendary Tower of Druaga is resurrected eighty years after the hero Gilgamesh has taken it down. In order to destroy the evil deity Druaga, the Kingdom of Uruk dispatches its troops to the tower, but the expedition repeatedly fails in its efforts. A young man named Jil who has been blessed by the goddess Ishtar, is awarded a set of brilliant golden amour and a sword from Gilgamesh as tokens to defeat the maumet. \nSent off by the cheering crowd, our young hero Jil confidently sets out to confront the evil deity inhabiting the tower. Helped by great friends such as the archer Neeba and a Mage called Fatina, he heads for the uppermost floor of the Tower!\nSource: crunchyroll",
