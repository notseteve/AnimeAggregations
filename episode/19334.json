  "description" : "Once a year, jewelers from around the country descend on New York City for a jewelry tradeshow, bringing with them their entire inventory. Combined, the jewelry is said to be worth 20 million dollars. Lupin and his gang plan to steal the whole lot, but things go awry when some children claim Lupin is their father. Jigen and Goemon find it hugely amusing, but they soon find themselves stuck in the same mess. Will the gang be able to juggle fatherhood and their thieving careers?\nSource: crunchyroll",
