The sound leads them to security guard Nezu Goro, who has been stabbed in the stomach with a knife. Nezu points towards the main avenue and says the words \"white clothes\" before he dies. Furthermore, at the top of the stairs Nezu is thought to have fallen down is the crying and screaming Yuki Keiko and the body of her husband Yuki Hideto, the IT company president.
