  "description" : "Sleepy\nDuring summer vacation, there`s morning exercise. Just three more days and they will win a prize. Bunji and the others got excited over it. The problem is, Bunji might not be able to wake up. So, Ma and his friends have promised to take turns waking him up.\nArt Diary\nBunji`s art diary is somewhat funny. He goes out with his friends to the pool and on the way back home, they have shaved ice, but Daichi ate shaved ice that`s as high as the ceiling, or that`s how it`s drawn. The other days become more suspicious...\nYukata\nFumi looked at a yukata advertisement and her eyes got all sparkly. Faced with no choice, they`ve gone downtown to buy it, only to see lots of stores on the street getting prepared for a festival tonight...\nFestival\nDuring the festival night, the Kamohara family has come down to scoop some goldfish. The night got lit up by fireworks and all adults turned back into children. A magical moment.\nSource: crunchyroll",
