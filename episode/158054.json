  "description" : "On their way to Megumi`s house, Megumi and Hime end up doing a lot of good deeds, such as clearing up litter, treating a injured puppy, helping a lost child, and giving someone courage to propose to his girlfriend. After having pancakes with Megumi and her mother, Hime laments how her parents were trapped inside mirrors by the Phantom Empire, whilst Megumi tells her how she wants to help out her mother, who has a weak body, citing her as the reason she loves helping others. Hoshiiwa takes advantage of Megumi`s helping nature to lure her and Hime into a trap, attacking them with a Mole Saiark. As Hoshiiwa passes off Megumi`s desire to help others as self-satisfaction, Hime stands by her side, believing in the genuine good feelings from helping others, and manages to break them free from the Saiark and defeat it. Afterwards, Megumi gives Hime her thanks for standing by her beliefs.\nNote: Cure Happy celebrates the 10th anniversary.",
