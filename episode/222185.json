  "description" : "Only a short time has passed since the Alliance`s failed invasion of the Empire, and an assassination attempt on Admiral Cubersly, a key figure in the Alliance Navy, further deepens the people`s anxiety. On top of that, an accidental explosion the following day takes fourteen young soldiers` lives. Growing discontent has caused revolts to break out on several planets within the Alliance. Bewcock orders Yang to put down these revolts, but before Yang has a chance to deploy, a coup d`état is executed on the capital planet Heinessen.\nSource: crunchyroll",
