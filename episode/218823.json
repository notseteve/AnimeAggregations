  "description" : "An incident occurs where Trisha Fellows is murdered by someone aboard the Rail Zeppelin. Lord El-Melloi II undertakes the investigation for the case, but Olga-Marie has doubts about his way of life as it is far from how a Mage should act. Meanwhile, Shishigou and Luvia, under Reines` orders, are conducting their own investigation. The Mystic Eyes Collection Train begins its procession once again, and a mysterious figure appears before Lord El-Melloi II and Gray. The assailant who descends upon the pair with overwhelming power is the materialization of a Heroic Spirit engraved into human history... A Servant.\nSource: crunchyroll",
