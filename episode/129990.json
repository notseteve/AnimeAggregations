  "description" : "Durandal manages to grab Shirayuki, and Aria and Kinji chase after her. They find her chained to the wall in a lower level of the warehouse, but Durandal is flooding the area. Kinji tells Aria to chase Durandal up to the higher level since she cannot swim, while he tries to free Shirayuki. Kinji is unable to pick all the locks before the water level rises above Shirayuki`s head, so he activates Hysteria Mode by kissing her, and he is able to pick the locks very quickly. Shirayuki is washed to the upper level ahead of him, and he sees her there. He asks her how her lips are, just as Aria arrives, and when this fails to fluster her he realises that \"Shirayuki\" is an impostor. The real Shirayuki appears and fights Durandal, whose true identity is Jeanne d`Arc XXX. By working together they manage to defeat Jeanne.",
