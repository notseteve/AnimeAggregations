  "description" : "It is the day of Isla`s retrieval, and neither she nor Tsukasa sleep. They clean up their apartment and when they get to the office Isla writes farewell letters to everyone. They go to the amusement park and visit all the attractions, enjoying themselves as much as they can, until the park is about to close. They go to the Ferris wheel and are permitted one last ride just as the park closes, and they ask what are the things that they love about each other until they are overcome by emotion. As the wheel reaches its highest point Isla declares that is where she wants it to end, and full of tears Tsukasa puts the retrieval ring on her finger, whispering to her at the last: \"I hope that one day you`ll be reunited with the person you cherish\" just as she always did.\nTsukasa is sent away for training for nine months and returns to Terminal Services to resume his work, and is assigned a new partner.",
