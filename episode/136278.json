  "description" : "Ichika becomes the heroine of the independent film the gang were planning before summer break. Kaito agrees, while helping Ichika look for that particular place she is looking for. Kanna becomes uneasy when the lines for the film becomes somewhat uncannily realistic, especially in the scenes involving Kaito and Ichika. Even Kaito was surprised by Ichika`s questions that evening. As the next day was a rainy one and filming is cancelled, Kanna goes to Kaito`s house to bring some nozawana. That evening, Tetsurou, after meeting an uneasy home-bound Kanna, sneaks into Kaito`s room, and tells him that she, his childhood friend, is in love with him. Ichika overhears the conversation.\nSource: Wiki",
