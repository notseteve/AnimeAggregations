  "description" : "Shiki overhears at school that three students went missing the previous night while they were in the city. When he returns home, Akiha has tea with him after dinner, and allows him to have a television, even though she normally dislikes noisy objects. Shiki manages to leave home and meet with Arcueid, who reveals she had been working to get money. They then notice the three supposedly missing students, whom Arcueid identifies as being under Roa`s control. Arcueid dispatches two, and Shiki manages to defeat the third. Afterwards, Shiki takes Arcueid through the city, and promises to go on a date with her later.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
