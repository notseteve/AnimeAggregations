  "description" : "Picking up where Brotherhood left off. Luke and Jan, the Valentine Brothers, lay siege to the headquarters of the Hellsing organization, the Royal Order of Religious Knights. After numerous humans have been killed and eaten by an army of ghouls, Victoria, Walter, and Arucard finally get around to striking back. Victoria and Walter eliminate hundreds of ghouls with a combination of deadly threads and heavy artillery. The lead flies when Arucard and Luke face off, but Luke is devoured by a canine monster Arucard summons up. Jan sets himself afire rather than reveal the mastermind of their plot to Sir Integra Hellsing.",
