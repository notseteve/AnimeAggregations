  "description" : "Below the Fifth Tower, Sado and Renji battle it out with a giant Hollow. But then, the sandman Batticaloa arrives to the scene. Batticaloa’s body is made of sand, so Sado and Renji have a hard time inflicting any damage on him. And Rukia, whose ice-snow Zanpakuto is the sole weapon that can contend with Batticaloa, is struggling in another battle against Rudobon. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Ulquiorra are still battling when Ichigo learns that Orihime has already been converted to Ulquiorra’s side. Ichigo pretends it doesn’t concern him, but he can’t hide his distress.\nSource: crunchyroll",
