  "description" : "One day, a huge eyeball appears near Mt. Fuji. People are shocked and panic. It just floats there, not doing anything, but Kitaro goes to get the situation under control. On his way there, he meets a man named Kadokura. He is researching youkai, specifically Daidarabocchi, and dreams of a world where humans and youkai live together. Kitaro warns him that it`s better if humans and youkai don`t grow too close, but he doesn`t listen. Why is Kadokura so obsessed with Daidarabocchi? And who are the dark hooded figures moving in secret to resurrect Daidarabocchi? What is their aim...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
