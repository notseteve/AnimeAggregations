  "description" : "Meliodas and Elizabeth try to enter the demon world. However, a sudden fall of a boulder threatens Elizabeth`s death. She has a short break, and although she is saved by Merlin, it turns out that Elizabeth`s \"Eternal Reincarnation\", which should have disappeared, has been revived. It also points out another fact to the Seven Deadly Sins: the Demon King is still alive. To revive the Demon King, you have to substitute someone. Meliodas knew that he could accept that much magical power. How did the Demon King make a comeback in the wilderness of the former Camelot site?\nSource: TheMovieDB",
