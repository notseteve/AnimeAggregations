  "description" : "Gessho and Unhi follow Setsuyo and Fuuki on their date, using the memory mallets to continue to return the memories of Setsuyo`s former life to her. Unfortunately, nothing goes quite as smoothly as planned and Gessho begins to suspect there`s more here at play. Unhi needs to marry Setsuyo in order to regain his place in the line of succession but the universe and even Unhi`s own servant seem to be against him being reunited with his love.\nSource: crunchyroll",
