  "description" : "When Chronos looks at the graduation album Kenzan and the others made, he shouts and holds an even more demanding lesson than usual, giving them math lessons, making them study kanji and do push-ups... When they boycott the lessons and the they get cancelled, he chases them around. Unable to watch any longer, Juudai challenges Chronos to a duel. The two of them face off in a way they haven`t since the entrance exam. Chronos summons Antique Gear Soldier and Juudai summons Flame Wingman.\nSource: crunchyroll",
