  "description" : "Joker, Spade, and Queen are indignant to learn that they have impostors on the loose! They initially suspect Shadow Joker, but he claims to have no knowledge of the incident. Lacking any other choice, the group leaves advance notice that they`re going to steal the same treasure the fakes are going after... but just as the fakes are about to reveal their identity, Inspector Oniyama shows up, leading to a chaotic, three-way standoff. Just who are the Fake Jokers?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
