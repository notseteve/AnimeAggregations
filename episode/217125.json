  "description" : "\"Kyoto has vanished?\" Right after finally getting rid of the twelve commanders of Susanoo, Takasugi and the others find themselves surrounded by a vast plain. Seimei explains the shocking truth that Susanoo Castle has traveled back to the distant past, and taken them with it! They`re not alone though, Mugensai has also been pulled back in time with the castle. Takasugi squares off against his masked foe, but a lucky blow reveals a familiar face hidden underneath. Meanwhile, back in the other time period, Sakamoto stares at the remains of the castle and clutches the chronometer as he contemplates what to do to bring back his friends.\nSource: crunchyroll",
