  "description" : "Haru absorbs the power of Etherion from Elie to his sword. This causes his attacks to be very effective against Sieg Hart. Reina remembers why she was ordered to watch over Sieg Hart. Sieg Hart explains to Haru that Elie is an experiment in the Etherion Project. He later explains about how Resha used the power of Etherion to cause a worldwide destruction that happened fifty years ago. Haru vows that he will save both Elie and the world from the power of Etherion, which doesn`t convince the pessimistic Sieg Hart. Sieg Hart then summons Altealice, the element of the universe, to alter time and space into nothingness. Musica, Plue, and Griff continue to search for Haru and Elie. Elie wakes up from her comatose state.\nSource: Wikipedia",
