  "description" : "In order to come to terms with his own negligence and revive Shion, Gobta, and his other fallen comrades, Rimuru reveals that he used to be a human. But his allies think nothing of it and accept him regardless, as if it`s the natural thing to do. Filled with gratitude for the warm, accepting environment he`s in, Rimuru turns his focus to the army from Falmuth. He entrusts Benimaru and the others to destroy the devices that are generating the enemy`s Prison Field while Rimuru himself sets out to attack the advancing army and use them as nourishment to become a Demon Lord.\nSource: crunchyroll",
