  "description" : "In the second match of the district preliminaries, Anita is too focused on being cautious of Seiwa Middle`s mobility and loses sight of everything else.\nEven from right field, Nishina saw this and points out her missteps so accurately that Anita can`t retort.\nShe had painful memories about the catcher position from her time at the prestigious Yokohama Littles as well.\nConcerned that she`s a failure as a catcher, and down on herself despite the game still going on, she asks Daigo to take over catching.\nSource: crunchyroll",
