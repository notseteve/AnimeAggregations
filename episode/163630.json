  "description" : "A few weeks earlier, Hajime is seen using his \"Pinpoint Abyss\" ability to defeat another ability user, returning him to regular life with no memory of his ability. It is revealed that this \"Fairy War\" between superpower humans is for the entertainment of a group of fairies, with the last eight users standing being granted a wish. One of these fairies, Litia, informs Hajime`s band of ability users, Fallen Black, that an organization known as F is fighting against the war, tasking Hajime with crushing it. While Hajime is meeting up with July, his second-in-command, Hitomi Saito, leads the group in attacking F`s base, encountering a mysterious girl allegedly possessing an unstoppable ability, though Hajime soon explains this girl is actually a new member known as System. Back in the present, it is revealed that Hajime`s group kidnapped Hatoko by mistake whilst trying to obtain Sayumi for her healing ability. Meanwhile, Sayumi uses her Root of Origin to return the Literature Club back to its original state, teleporting Hatoko back to their side safely, after which Tomoyo clears up the confusion Hatoko had while July apologizes in his own way. While trying to open a bag of potato chips, July`s \"Dark and Dark\" awakens its next evolution. \nSource: Wikipedia",
