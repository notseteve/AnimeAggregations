  "description" : "When they meet with a traffic accident, Gintoki and Hijikata miraculously escape without a scratch, but their souls end up switching bodies. With no means to return to normal, Gintoki has to live as a freedom-loving Hijikata, and Hijikata as a Gintoki who stresses strict discipline. The change in these two leaders transforms the Shinsengumi and Odd Jobs into completely different organizations.\nSource: crunchyroll",
