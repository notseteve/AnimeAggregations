  "description" : "There are warnings about mysterious murders taking place on the Bug Planet. After arrival, Tetsuro and Maetel come across the murder scene of a business man. It seems that the key to the murders is a girl named Keiko who supports the bugs` cause and has sided with them. She then quickly asks Tetsuro if he`d become a bug-man to help save the planet`s insects. Then, some very tiny bug-men appear in front of Tetsuro.\nSource: crunchyroll",
