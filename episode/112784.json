  "description" : "Lately, more people have been going missing between Ikebukuro and Shibuya. The ones going missing are people like runaways and illegal aliens; people who won`t be missed. And today, once again, a group of young thugs, metal pipes in hand, have broken into an abandoned hotel where illegal aliens live to go \"manhunting\". They call the fleeing people \"materials\", but then where is the \"drop-off point\" they speak of? And which surprising group of people stood up to save the person they captured?\nSource: crunchyroll",
