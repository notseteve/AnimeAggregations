  "description" : "Elmina is the daughter of heaven. She`s not entirely that bright in some ways and sometimes comes off as a snob. Glenda instantly hates her mostly cause of the rivalry between the heaven and the demon world. However everytime Glenda points an accusing finger at her Elmina assumes she`s talking to someone else. It seems she also is a Platium Princess Canidate and is having a little trouble adjusting to Earth since she`s not allowed to use her wings. Her arrival also corresponds with parents day. Both Glenda and Yucie are both freaked out by this. Both for different reasons. Will their parents embarrass them as they fear? Will they survive Parent`s Night?\nSource: tv.com",
