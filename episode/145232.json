  "description" : "Becoming curious about the girl she saw the other day, Kaito hears from Junna about various sightings of the girl. As Akiho and Subaru deal with an interview for the Robo-One tournament, Kaito and Junna go to the beach, where they encounter the cadaver of a beached whale. Hearing that Junna has retired from the karate club, Kaito suggests she pay a visit to the Robotics Club. Later that night, Kaito hears the strange voice again, leading him to an abandoned building, where he finally encounters the girl through his Poke-Com. This AI, named Airi, reveals herself to be an Iru-O app that had attempted to contact Kaito over the past 8 years. She then shows Kaito a hidden file, containing report by one Kimijima Kou. The file, \"Kimijima`s Report No. 1\", was created due to Kimijima`s fear for his death. It details that in 2000, NASA discovered the existence of monopoles at the Sun`s south polar region but initiated a massive cover up on the matter. Kimijima also reveals that the Sun is on the verge of explosion, preceded by large-scale solar flares during 2012, 2015, and 2019 and ending in 2020. As Kaito ponders how many of those predictions turned out to be accurate, Mizuka has a strange reaction when Kaito asks her about Kimijima. \nSource: Wikipedia",
