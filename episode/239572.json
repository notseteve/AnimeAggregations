As Naruto and Himawari watch, they activate their Karmas and confront one another. Meanwhile, Delta joins up with Koji Kashin, who’s still pursuing Kawaki. Somehow, Koji is able to sneak into the village without triggering the Hidden Leaf’s sensory system. Delta is left with no choice but to wait for his return. But when he doesn’t come back, she runs out of patience.\nSource: crunchyroll",
