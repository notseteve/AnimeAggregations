  "description" : "\"Lately, Haruka has been worried that there might be something wrong with Hazuki. Yuuto thinks she is reading into things too much, but Mika and Nanami also agrees with Haruka that something is different about Hazuki. \nIt was coincidently right after that, Hazuki took her personal time off.  Following Mika’s idea, everyone decides to follow her. Yuuto can’t help but be stunned by the gap between the usual expressionless Hazuki and the Hazuki in the city shopping around at a cute stuffed animal toy shop and fancy lingerie shops. As they follow her, Hazuki finally meets with a man who walks out from a building with a bridal shop, and the two of them walk back into the building, seeming very friendly.\n\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
