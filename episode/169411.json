  "description" : "Izumi Hayato is griping after having lost the student council presidency election to Wakana Ui who ran under a platform of liberalising romance in the school, even giving away free condoms. Hayato is left as vice president. Ui later asks Hayato when he will be home that evening, believing that she only plans to call him at that time. He is shocked that she suddenly appears at his house at that time, wearing a bride`s veil, carrying all of her things, and calling him her husband, saying that their parents arranged their marriage. Hayato refuses to accept the ridiculous situation, but cannot just turn Ui out as it is much too late. After he finds Ui his bed, saying that married couples should sleep with each other, his lustful side awakens, and he begins to fondle and suck her breasts, but he is interrupted in this escalation by a sudden international call from his father, at which point Ui has fallen asleep again.",
