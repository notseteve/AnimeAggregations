  "description" : "Nadeshiko and Amu watch Kukai`s soccer team practice where Amu encounters Yamada, one of Kukai`s teammates. However, when the coach announces the starters for the next match against a top ranked team, Yamada does not make the list. At the match, Yamada sneaks away while feeling that he cannot match Kukai`s abilities. Nikaidou takes advantage of Yamada`s feelings and extracts Yamada`s Heart`s Egg, which turns into an X Egg and hatches into an X Character. Amu transforms and is able to purify the X Character just in time for the coach to declare Yamada as a substitute one of the starters. With Yamada`s efforts, the team is able to tie the game.\nSource: crunchyroll",
