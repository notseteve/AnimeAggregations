  "description" : "Hakumenfudo demands that its subordinate get Dororo`s face, telling her to throw Dororo into the basin of the waterfall. Meanwhile, she has developed tender feelings toward Dororo, who is attached to her as if she were her own mother. So she cannot obey Hakumenfudo`s orders. When she manages to escape from Hakumenfudo with Dororo, however, stray dogs manipulated by Fudo attack her, tearing her body into pieces. The dogs try to attack Dororo next, but Hyakkimaru defeats them all. He has come into the mountains following the smell of demons. Hyakkimaru finds out about the monster Hakumenfudo that haunts the waterfall, and defeats it. Then Hakumenfudo, who has killed many ascetics by taking their faces, turns out to be just the mold on the rocks.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
