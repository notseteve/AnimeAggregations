  "description" : "After Camus’s defeat, and with Seiya and Shun closing in, Arles is getting a little jumpy. And with only one-hour left to save Athena, Seiya and Shun must move fast. To save time, they agree to let Shun fight Aphrodite in the house of Pisces, while Seiya runs ahead to face Arles. Shun successfully holds Aphrodite at bay while Seiya runs through the house of Pisces, but once he reaches the path to Arles’s house, Seiya discovers it to be covered with Aphrodite’s magical roses. Seiya must step on the roses to advance to Arles’s house, but as he does, he falls unconscious succumbing to their mysterious powers. Shun cannot help his friend, instead he must listen to the Aphrodite’s sinister laughter as they prepare for battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
