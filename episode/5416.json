  "description" : "About half the episode consists of new scenes expanding into the creation of Coordinators, the origin of the hate between Naturals and Coordinators, the issues that escalated into the Bloody Valentine attack and the subsequent deployment of Neutron Jammers (or N-Jammers) and war, as well as some technical babble regarding the five mobile suits developed by the Earth Alliance. The rest of the episode consists mostly of old scenes (recap). The old scenes and new scenes are intertwined throughout the episode.",
