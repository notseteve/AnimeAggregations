  "description" : "Ryuko Matoi transfers into Honnouji Academy, a high school dominated by its fearsome student council, who wear powerful Goku Uniforms that grant them superhuman abilities. Searching for clues to her father`s murder, Ryuko confronts the student council president, Satsuki Kiryuin, saying she is looking for the owner of the other half of a giant scissor blade she wields. She is easily beaten by the school`s boxing club captain, Takaharu Fukuroda, using the power of his Two-Star Goku Uniform. Fleeing to her ruined home nearby, Ryuko is dropped down a trapdoor by her homeroom teacher, Aikuro Mikisugi. She lands in a basement and discovers a living sailor uniform that forcibly puts itself on her. The next day, Takaharu prepares to sentence Ryuko`s friendly classmate Mako Mankanshoku to death for treason. Ryuko arrives to rescue her and confront Takaharu again, this time using her new uniform`s powers to defeat him and destroy his Goku Uniform. Afterwards, Ryuko questions Satsuki again about the wielder of the other scissor blade, who is allegedly the one who killed her father.",
