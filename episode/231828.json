  "description" : "After the Magic Sword Tournament, Anos and the other students visit Azeshion in the Human Realm for an educational exchange with the Hero Academy. While they individually explore the city, Anos heads to the Hero Academy saying that he wants to research something. The academy is off-limits to outsiders, but without hesitation, he tries to make his way inside. Eleanor Bianca, a third-year student at the Hero Academy, appears before Anos and says, \"You`ll be safe as long as you`re with me\" with a mischievous smile. She acts as Anos` guide inside the academy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
