  "description" : "Even though the first match was a victory, Tsukushi is depressed that he was unable to do anything. That`s when Indou Kaoru, the captain of Seiseki`s rival school, Saku High, appears before Tsukushi. He invites Tsukushi to play soccer, and the two of them go to a futsal court. Despite the other team having an unsurmountable lead, Tsukushi doubles down on his soccer of \"running more than anyone else\" and enables his team to score a goal by becoming a decoy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
