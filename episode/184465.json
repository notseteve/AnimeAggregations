  "description" : "Yuu waits by the ticket gates at a train station, and it`s Koyuki who arrives to meet him. They`ve decided, at her suggestion, to check out this town that she once visited when filming for a variety show. Meanwhile Yuu`s band, The Fallen Moon, has been selected as an opening act for a gig at a live music club. Fuuka suggests they write an original song to play there, but a strange sense of confusion in her heart makes the process difficult.\nSource: crunchyroll",
