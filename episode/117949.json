  "description" : "Yamamoto’s and Lambo’s tests are finished, and Gokudera starts getting impatient for his turn. Fong tells him to calm down, but Gokudera doesn’t want to hear that. In order to prepare for his upcoming succession test, Gokudera opens his Box Weapon to train with Uri, but Uri is disobedient as usual and runs away. While Gokudera is running around looking for Uri, another Gokudera appears before Fong! When Tsuna and his friends see the person pretending to be Gokudera, they sense that something is out of place, but then their super intuition is sealed!\nSource: crunchyroll",
