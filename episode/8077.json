  "description" : "Bokomon took the gang to get their futures told by Shamanmon, the fortune teller. Just as Shamanmon started the premonition tango, Grumblemon attacked and this time he brought a friend. With the strength of Golemon behind him, Grumblemon stole Tommy`s Spirit. BurningGreymon joined in on the fight but he didn`t know the difference between good guys and bad. Gogglehead figured out that it was Shamanmon possessed by a Beast Spirit but when he freed Shamanmon, the Beast Spirit possessed him instead! Then when he started attacking his friends, Koji had to Digivolve to KendoGarurumon to stop him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
