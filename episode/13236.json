  "description" : "Tomobiki High is in a frenzy to get ready for the school festival. Props need to be made, costumes designed, and maybe somewhere sleep to be had! Ataru, Lum, Shutaro, Shinobu, and the rest of Class 2-4 are determined to not be outdone this year, and they`re rushing to make the final preparations for tomorrow`s grand opening. Once they wake up the next morning, they continue their mad rush to get ready for tomorrow`s grand opening. And then the next day... hey, isn`t something strange going on? Silence lingers over the city, the buildings filled with nothing but dust and mold. Is this a dream? Or have the kids (and a few related adults) of Class 2-4 finally woken up? If they can spend each day having fun with each other, does it matter?\nSource: crunchyroll",
