  "description" : "Amu is having a dream that she talking to Dia about the Embryo. Kazuomi and Ikuto go to see Gozen. Later, the Guardians (including Kukai) meet up in a place to hang out when Amu receives a message to be somewhere, which turns out to be a trap. Ikuto overhears this and rescues Amu. Meanwhile, hundreds of X Eggs inside UFO-shaped containers are scanning a large area in search for the Embryo. After Amu rejoins the group, they all Character Transform and attack. After the X Eggs are purified, the Embryo is seen floating, and both Amu and Ikuto head toward it. Via laptop, Kazuomi tells the Easter workers in the helicopter to get the Embryo, and one of them accidentally presses a giant red button that launches a missile. Ikuto blocks it, but is harmed from the blast and falls down holding Amu. Kukai and Tadase rescue them both, and Ikuto leaves grinning.\nSource: crunchyroll",
