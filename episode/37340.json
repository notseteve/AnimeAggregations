She then returns to Munich and Dr. Reichwein where she volunteers for hypnosis to find the truth behind these memories. After she nearly kills Dr. Gillen in a hypnotic rage, she leaves Dr. Reichwein`s house to try to stop Tenma from killing her brother. Meanwhile, Suk and Vardemann team up to interview former residents of the Mansion of Red Roses to gather information on Franz Bonaparta`s reading sessions with his picture books, and for Vardemann to find out more about his father`s true involvement.\n[I]Source: theTVDB.com[/I]",
