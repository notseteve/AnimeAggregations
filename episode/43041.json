  "description" : "Alice is in a pretty bad mood.  Her dorm doesn`t allow pets but she`s secretly taking care of a kitten; her mentor Athena is an absolute clutz; and to top it all off, she has decided that her left hand isn`t as skilled as her right hand, and is therefore useless.  Though Alice certainly does have a strange set of problems, and they all seem separate from each other, she`s certain to discover that the answers to each all are connected.\nSource: crunchyroll",
