  "description" : "Takara summons Izumo`s familiar, Fox God Mike, to talk about the past surrounding the Kamiki family and the Inari Taisha Shrine. Coming from a long line of shrine maidens, Tamamo, Izumo and Tsukumo`s mother, serves as the head of the family who must bear the burden of controlling the fox demon, Nine Tails. Although Izumo possesses excellent divine power as a shrine maiden, she has no one she can rely on in her private life – she spends her days with her boisterous mother and younger sister. Those days fell into ruin when the Inari Light Foundation appeared and made its move.\nSource: crunchyroll",
