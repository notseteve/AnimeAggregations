  "description" : "Arashi was asked by manga illustrator, Anamori, to act out a kissing scene that will inspire her to draw the scene. First, Kaya was chosen to be her partner for the scene, but the scene failed because Kaya’s breath had the smell of gyoza. Yaoi and Kanako followed, but they were not able to successfully act out the scene either. Hajime and Jun tried to act out the scene, but this was stopped by Arashi. The place turned into chaos as Sunglasses and Yamashiro were called out to do a kissing scene. \nSource: crunchyroll",
