  "description" : "On the Floor of the Rainforest, Jil is targeted by an assassin working for Gremica. Then, two more assassins appear. Meanwhile, Neeba and Kaaya are churning their way through the Floor of the Lake. In their conversation, Kaaya advocates the graciousness of God, but Neeba replies with frustration that God is capricious. These two are also attacked by two assassins. The four assassins are droids with the spirits of the four knights that used to guard Druaga. Neeba speculates that they come from the caskets that Pazuz had been carrying. The ones attacking Jil are Mite and Specula. Jil, along with Fatina, Utu, and Henaro, struggle to put up a fight. The ones attacking Neeba are Blood and Ice. Neeba is cornered, when Kaaya casts a powerful spell.\nSource: crunchyroll",
