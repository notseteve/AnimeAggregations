  "description" : "Ash and Goh are checking out some Tentacool when a Pokémon races toward them from across the sea—it’s an exhausted, ravenous Piplup! They learn that its Trainer, Lauren, has been searching for it after it swam away from her in the Sinnoh region. It turns out the proud Piplup is engaged in a fierce rivalry with Lauren’s other Pokémon, a Croagunk who loves being spoiled. Back in Sinnoh, Piplup challenges Croagunk to a Pokémon Iceberg Race, but Team Rocket throws the event into chaos! When Lauren finds herself in danger, the two Pokémon set aside their differences to save their Trainer—and they become good friends as a result!\nSource: Official Website",
