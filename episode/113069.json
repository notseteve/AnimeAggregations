  "description" : "Tsuna draws on the First Generation Vongola, Mantello di Vongola Primo’s self-defense mode to nullify Torikabuto’s attack. He uses the Sky “harmony factor” to harmonize Torikabuto’s sea snake with the surrounding buildings, thereby turning it into stone. After that, Tsuna punches Torikabuto and knocks him down to the ground. The Vongola side gets excited about this win, but it doesn’t matter how many people you beat—the game doesn’t end unless you defeat the target. Yamamoto braces himself to attack the target, and just then, his fated enemy appears before him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
