And it`s not just her. None of the yokai of the other seven wonders has been seen lately. Just then, the Sand-throwing Hag and Child`s-cry Old Man arrive, having not been able to contact their old friend Ninomiya Kinjirou. They sense someone`s presence and chase after it, all the way to the boy`s bathroom on the second floor... What is happening at the school?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
