  "description" : "Lenka, still concerned about the plight of the refugees who were refused entry, asks what is the status of the construction of the Aegis and is told that they are only 0.06% of the way there. Meanwhile, Rindou and Soma are assigned to a different mission. Lenka asks Sakuya if they can hunt stronger Aragami whose cores will help the construction of the Aegis proceed more quickly, and she proposes that they attempt to hunt the large Vajra Aragami. They manage to kill one, but find themselves surrounded by several of them in an area with many civilians. The Vajras are attacked by a strange and very powerful black Aragami called a Dyaus Pita that was only previously conjectured. Sakuya orders them to retreat as their weapons prove ineffective against it, but it manages to quickly incapacitate her, Kouta, and Alisa. Lenka manages to damage it slightly, strengthened by his need to protect the civilians, but ultimately the Dyaus Pita breaks his God Arc and seriously wounds him. He attempts to escape with Alisa, but they fall down a pit with the Dyaus Pita behind.",
