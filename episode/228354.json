  "description" : "The next opponent for Fuurin`s baseball team is going to be Seiwa, Daigo and Sakura`s old Little League teammates Urabe and Andy now play. After seeing Seiwa steal 11 bases in their first match and seeing that match be called, both Anita and Daigo are made painfully aware that they need to do something to combat Seiwa`s mobility and base stealing prowess. That`s why Daigo calls the team to school even though they just finished a match, in order to allow their pitcher Mutsuko train so she can deal with the enemy runners.\nSource: crunchyroll",
