  "description" : "As the starting time for Opening Ceremony draws nearer, the seats in the theater begin to fill, yet there is no sign of Shiki. Worried, Hoshitani begs the others to give him time to go look for Shiki, but the rest of Team Otori insists on joining him. At the same time, Kasugano notices that Fuyusawa is acting strangely. The second-year students are hoping for all five members of the Kao Council to see their performance, and, in the face of their strong beliefs, Fuyusawa is finally moved. The curtain is now rising on the new future of Ayanagi Academy and the dreams of Hoshitani and company!\nSource: crunchyroll",
