  "description" : "Though Yukimura and Himuro went as far as to kiss for the experiment, they were soundly beaten by Chris and Suiu`s oxytocin levels in their saliva. Panicked, Yukimura suggests that they conduct control experiments. However, in the midst of the Yukimura/Suiu pairing, Suiu`s seductive manner ends up causing Yukimura to ogle her charms. Seeing that, Himuro runs another experiment with Yukimura, but ends up sulking. The two end up having a lover`s quarrel. Yukimura`s behavior causes Chris to look down at him coldly and say, \"As a man, you are a failure.\"\nSource: Crunchyroll",
