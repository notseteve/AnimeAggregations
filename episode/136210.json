  "description" : "At the Magic Academy, a ball is held in celebration of Louise, Saito, and the others deeds in Romalia. Louise and Saito dance, and he expresses his wish to be with her forever, leading to a passionate kiss between the two. Meanwhile in Galia Tabitha uses an antidote given to her by Bidalsha to cure her mother. The following day, Siesta overhears how Tifa tried to kiss Saito and suggests to Louise that they should separate Saito from Tifa by buying a house were only he and Louise would live, and Louise agrees. Louise rejects all of Saito and Siesta’s choices, and becomes further irritated when Siesta reveals she too will be living with them. Things become worse for the girls when they discover Saito has become increasingly popular with women due to his heroic status, and so decide to hasten their efforts. Back in Galia, Tabitha is asked by her mother to become the new queen for both the country and her father’s sake. Three days later, Agnes brings Saito and Louise to Henrietta, who informs them that Tabitha will be Galia’s new queen and to reward Saito for his previous deeds with a portion of her territory. Saito, Louise, and Siesta arrive in their new land, Ornières, only to find that it is a forest and their mansion is old and decrepit, but stay anyway since it was a gift. That night, the trio is visited by Tabitha who reveals she will be moving in with them since she postponed her coronation.\nSource: Wiki",
