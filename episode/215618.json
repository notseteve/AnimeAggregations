  "description" : "\"Katsura has been acting weird lately.\" Katsura has begun to investigate the whereabouts of the chronometer on his own since its presence hasn`t been felt for quite some time. Realizing something is going on with Katsura, Takasugi consults with Ryoma about the situation. Takasugi stubbornly insists that he will get the chronometer back from Katsura and carry out Master Shoin`s dying wish to return time back to normal. But Ryoma questions if that timeline truly is the \"right\" one and in the midst of their argument a strange phenomenon occurs and they rush outside. Once outside the duo notices that everyone and everything seems frozen in place!\nSource: crunchyroll",
