  "description" : "A few days later, Suzune introduces a friend of hers named Chinami Kanan, considered to be the prettiest girl in school, who wants to get into the top ten in the upcoming physics tests so that her parents will allow her to see a concert of the famous American singer You Red Pond. Kanan never talks, and only communicates by texting Suzune. Kagami later learns that Kanan supposedly has a sort of natural \"anime voice\", which immediately piques his interest, and he tries to get her to speak, and his repeated attempts to do so irritate her so much that she tries to drive him away.\nEventually, Kagami and Suzune visit Kanan in her house, and strike a deal that if he can get her to have a top ten score in the upcoming physics exam, she will let him hear her voice. He writes increasingly elaborate games to help her study, until he eventually collapses from the effort. It is later revealed that Kanan`s voice attracted unwanted attention online which was only displaced by You Red Pond`s concerts, so she resolved never to speak again, but Kagami wins her over with his dedication and she gets over this hangup.",
