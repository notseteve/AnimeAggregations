After losing his special privileges, including the right to live in Chronos, Sion now lives in Losttown with his mother, Karan.  One day, Sion is working as a supervisor at a park, when he discovers the body of a dead man.  The corpse appears to be of an elderly man, but Sion soon learns that the body belongs to a man who was in his thirties, and this fact is being concealed by the city authorities.  The next day, Sion`s co-worker, Yamase, is also transformed into an old man instantaneously before dying.  Immediately after this happens, Sion witnesses a bee clawing its way out of Yamase`s neck.\nSource: crunchyroll",
