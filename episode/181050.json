  "description" : "Peaceful scenery passes by outside the car window, but Azuma has no idea that the kind old man giving him a lift toward the island fortress is Guy himself. Meanwhile, back at their hideout, Kogane and the others are being attacked, and Matobai and Tsuwabuki realize that Azuma is gone. Hiiragi and Kinoa say that until he comes back with Kaoruko, they`re on their own, but Matobai`s subdued gaze is fixed on the Buranki Batolov.\nSource: crunchyroll",
