Keima treats her coldly in an attempt to learn what is troubling her, but Kanon is so hurt that she goes into a state of shock and her body becomes transparent!  It appears to be related to the loose soul inside her...but as Elsie looks for information about Kanon, she learns about something that happened in Kanon`s past.  In the meantime, Kanon`s dream concert at Narusawa Seaside Hall is drawing near.\nSource: crunchyroll",
