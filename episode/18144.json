  "description" : "Now we`re on the wire. Six Chaos Emerald have been found, but Eggman has one, and plans to use his E-77 robot to seek out the last one. Meanwhile, Knuckles is looking for the Last Chaos Emerald too. He realizes that the only way for him, Sonic, Tails, Chris, Amy, Cream, and Cheese to get all the Chaos Emeralds is to team up with Eggman. So Knuckles visits the Thorndyke residence, but Sonic, Tails, Cream, Amy, and Cheese are out looking for the last Chaos Emereald as well, so Knuckles teams up with Chris to go to Eggman`s base and ask for a partnership. Eggman agrees, but he asks if he can hold the Chaos Emeralds that they have, and foolishly Knuckles agrees. Chris and Knuckles try to keep it a secret from Sonic, Tails, Amy, Cream, and Cheese though. Meanwhile, it turns out that Eggman tricked him, and he steals the Chaos Emeralds for himself...as E-77 is returning with the last Chaos Emerald....what will happen next?",
