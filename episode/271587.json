  "description" : "To create an advertisement for a renovated amusement park, Momose and Shirosaki go on-site to gather information. From merry-go-rounds to roller coasters, the two try out various attractions after Shirosaki states, \"It`s essential to enjoy the attractions firsthand to create a good advertisement.\" On the way home from their successful on-site research, the train they are riding in suddenly stops after a power outage.
