  "description" : "Our heroes are in Hoenn to research the migration of Beautifly—the window of time to do this is small, so when a north wind appears, Ash and Goh must be ready!\nMeanwhile, Raboot has been sneaking away at night, and Goh is frustrated with its attitude. Looking for answers, Goh and Ash follow Raboot…and they discover that it’s been helping the local Pokémon secure their home by way of a dance battle! Goh decides Raboot will be happier without him, but just as he’s about to leave, he panics. Right on time, though, Raboot appears—and although it’s still a bit aloof, Goh is happy to be reunited!\nSource: Official Website",
