  "description" : "Naruto and the others are exhausted from their battle with Isshiki. Suddenly, Boruto attacks Sasuke. Momoshiki has taken control of Boruto’s consciousness and stands before them as an enemy. Kawaki desperately calls out to Boruto to snap him out of it. Unfortunately, his words are unable to reach him. Sasuke tells Kawaki a way to bring back Boruto’s consciousness. In order to save Boruto, Kawaki attempts a risky plan using a jutsu he only recently learned. While Kawaki and Sasuke fight a desperate battle, Naruto finally runs out of strength. As his consciousness fades, he and Kurama quietly reminisce about their past.\nSource: crunchyroll",
