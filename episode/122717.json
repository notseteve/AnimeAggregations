  "description" : "The girls` class has to decide on a class representative for the second semester. The first semester class representative, Tachibana Mamiko, instantly raises her hand as a candidate. However, the entire class is in a state of unease. The reason? Mamiko is a quick to nag and really strict class representative who is feared and called Nag-iko.  Everyone thinks her continuing as class representative spells trouble.  Suddenly, Saotome nominates Ringo for class representative; a move that surprises Ringo. Ringo claims her being class rep is impossible, but the class is so excited that they won`t listen to her.   Seeing the situation, Mr. Atsui proposes to let Ringo be class rep for three days as a test.\nSource: crunchyroll",
