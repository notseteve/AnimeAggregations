  "description" : "Izumida and Kishigami`s all out sprint is in its final stage when a fan`s water bottle falls onto the course. Andy and Frank signal Izumida to slow down and avoid the obstacle. However, Izumida recalls his race against Tadokoro and Naruko at last year`s Inter-high and charges ahead! And the winner is... Izumida! As the captain of Hakone Academy and the team`s ace sprinter, he has fulfilled his heavy responsibility. Though Kishigami fails to satisfy his desire for muscles, he accepts his defeat.\nSource: crunchyroll",
