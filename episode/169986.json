  "description" : "Kagami comes into school one day in a good mood, showing off a powerful rare card for the trading card game Magic The Ring. Makina confiscates this as it is in violation of school rules, but intended to give it back to him the next day. Her little brother Kazuya is also an avid player, but keeps constantly getting beaten, so he steals the card, believing it will help him win. However, he  loses the card during a game to a boy named Kenji, as he is not that skilled.\nMeanwhile, a student from the class next to Kagami`s, Odawara Joe, asks him for advice on hooking up with a girl. He initially refuses, until Odawara tells him that the girl he likes is Makina. He gets constant nosebleeds whenever talking to any girl so Kagami trains him by using Koutarou as a proxy for Makina, with a program to simulate her reactions. The real Makina sees them, and Odawara tries to confess to her, but he is kicked in the face for his trouble. Thus disenchanted with Makina his affections attach to Koutarou, who objects that despite his cross-dressing he is not homosexual.\nMakina explains to Kagami what happened to his card, and tells him that if he wants it back he has to win it back himself, but he tells Kazuya that it is a gamer`s pride to win back what they lose in a fair game. Kagami then begins to train Kazuya in the game, so his skills improve, and eventually he manages to beat Kenji  and win back Kagami`s card.",
