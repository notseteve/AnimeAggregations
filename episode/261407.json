  "description" : "Each player unleashed their weapon and ego, and Team Z has caught up to a draw. They totally have the momentum of the game, but that has “awakened” Team V’s monster, Nagi. In the chain reaction to awakening, Isagi also learns to use his weapon and keeps fighting. The “heat” generated by the clashing of ego from both teams starts to affect Kuon as well.\nSource: crunchyroll",
