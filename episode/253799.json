  "description" : "One night, while Fushihara is working overtime at the office, she hears a scary voice from out of nowhere, commanding her to leave. She tries to ignore it and get on with her work, but then suddenly her monitor turns to black, with the word \"Leave\" repeated on it endlessly. When a frustrated Fushihara goes to look for the owner of the scary voice, what does she find but the little baby ghost, Yuurei-chan! When Fushihara explains to her that she can`t leave until she finishes her work, the little ghost replies earnestly, \"Then I`ll help you! So you can leave!\"\nSource: Crunchyroll",
