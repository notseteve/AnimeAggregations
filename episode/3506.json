  "description" : "My mother and I ran into Sakura and her family at Tsukimine Shrine for New Year`s rituals. They were supposed to meet Yukito, but he didn`t show up so Toya went to go find him. Sakura and I went to get our fortunes and were really surprised to find Eriol giving them out instead of a shrine maiden! My fortune said that my dream would come true this year. I think it meant that I`ll get to film Sakura just the way I always wanted to! Sakura`s fortune was a lot more confusing, though... It said she`d learn the truth in her first dream of the new year. She told me she had a pretty strange dream that night, too.\nSource: crunchyroll",
