  "description" : "A God of Poverty named Momiji is sent down to earth to greet a spoiled high-school girl named Ichiko Sakura, who has had good fortune all her life. Momiji explains that Ichiko has an abnormally high level of good fortune, and is also sucking up fortune from those near her. Momoji attempts to take some of Ichiko`s fortune and make her a normal girl, but Ichiko manages to fight her off. The nexy day, however, Ichiko`s butler, Suwano, has a heart attack and is left in a critical condition as a result of Ichiko taking his fortune over the years he served her. Ichiko agrees to let Momiji suck some good fortune out of her, but then she runs off with it and releases it at the hospital, saving Suwano`s life. Afterwards, Ichiko decides to sack Suwano from his position so he can live his own life without being at risk. A week later, Ichiko`s fortune levels soon return, as does Momiji.",
