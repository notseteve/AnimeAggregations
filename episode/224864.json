  "description" : "After catching Scorbunny and learning about his Pokédex, Goh is determined to catch lots more Pokémon! But it’s slow going at first when Scorbunny becomes overly excited, causing Pokémon after Pokémon to flee the commotion. Goh’s luck changes when he focuses on Bug-type Pokémon that live in Kanto, and he catches a Caterpie, Metapod, and Venomoth, followed by a Paras, Parasect, and Butterfree. After several more catches, he has just two Bug-type Pokémon to go: Venonat and Scyther. Goh and Scorbunny battle it out with both, and they succeed! Along with Ash and Pikachu, they return to the Cerise Laboratory, where all of Goh’s new Pokémon settle right in!\nSource: Official Website",
