  "description" : "Nanoka receives a love letter at school. She doesn`t know what to do about it. She asks Koshiro what she should do about the love letter and he indifferently says she should make up her own mind and not consult him. She meets with her admirer and turns down his advances and then is disappointed when he doesn`t seem to care. Koshiro regrets his prior indifference and tells Nanoka that if she wants advice about anything, she can ask him. She is impressed by his concern about her and says \"I love you\".\nSource: theTVDB.com",
