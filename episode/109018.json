  "description" : "Natsuru stops Akane from shooting Kaede and the attacker escapes when the bell for class rings. Natsuru realizes that the enemy also goes to his school and becomes wary of the danger and cautious of the other girls around him. He and Akane are interrogated by Shizuku Sangō, the student council president, about what happened in the library. Natsuru promises to let Kaede meet his Kämpfer form the next day, and Akane and their messengers suggest making Kaede hate Natsuru`s Kämpfer form, but instead she asks him out. Natsuru discovers Shizuku to be the enemy Kämpfer. Natsuru and Akane have trouble fighting against her, but eventually manage to stop her. Natsuru makes a deal with Shizuku to let her live if she leaves Kaede alone. Noticing rumors about Kämpfer Natsuru being spotted, Shizuku enrolls him into the girl`s side of the school. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
