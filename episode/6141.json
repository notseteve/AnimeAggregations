  "description" : "The Digidestined hunted high and low for their D-Tectors but those birdbrained Toucanmon flew off with them. When they tried to swim after the birds, some Gomamon stopped them, which was good because they were about to swim into some nasty whirlpools. So they all set sail on a raft they built and of course, Ranamon attacked. She knocked Kazemon to the ocean floor, but there, Zoe found her Beast Spirit and evolved into Zephyrmon. The whirlpool calmed and the beast Calmaramon was defeated but the guys` D-Tectors were still gone.\nSource: crunchyroll",
