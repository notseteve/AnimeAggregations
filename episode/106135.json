  "description" : "We don’t know where Lin Regiostar resides who is the ghost of the Catholic priest. Since his first appearance, nothing has really happened with him. It`s finally time for him to rest in peace. However, the reason he wants to rest in peace is to remain in this world to clear up his strong regret. That regret is not making out with a maid. Is he drawing closer to the hand of the devil? Can Hayate protect Maria? Isumi is dressed as a maid and Maria, Saki are already maids. When the third maid appears, all sorts of conversations begin.\nSource: crunchyroll",
