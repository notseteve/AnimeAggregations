  "description" : "Lal Mirch says that Reborn has died. Tsuna cannot hide his shock. He ends up following Lal, who is headed to the Vongola hideout, but he can’t get the thought out of his head. Gokudera manages to cheer him up, but he is still anxious about the fact that they’ve come to the future and don`t know what they’re doing. Along the way, the sun has set. The three of them decide to camp out. Once the group has procured food and settled down, Lal talks about the situation for the first time. What she says is far more awful than Tsuna and Gokudera ever imagined.\nSource: crunchyroll",
