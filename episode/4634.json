  "description" : "Ko-o’s conspiracy to stop Kei from being richer than Ko fails with the death of his Kirin, Korin.  Yoko and Rakushun talk about the world.  Yoko is a queen of one of the 12 Kingdoms created by Heaven and Keiki is her Kirin.  Yoko(Kei-o), En-o, Enki and Taiki are Taikas, who were supposed to be born in this world but were born in Japan because their Rankas(Eggs) got trapped in the Shoku(Storm).  Yoko is concerned about Asano, who’s still missing, and Sugimoto, who went home.  Rakushun thinks Yoko regrets her choice to be a queen, but she thanks him for counting on her to build a kingdom.\nSource: crunchyroll",
