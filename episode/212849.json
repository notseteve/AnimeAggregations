  "description" : "After meeting a deadline, Subaru sleeps well into the afternoon. When he finally wakes, he`s greeted by an email from Hiroto announcing that his sister Narumi and her friend Haru-chan will be paying him a visit. He barely has time to feel surprised by the short notice before the girls arrive at his door. They bring food made by Haru-chan`s mother as a gift, and Subaru can`t suppress his stomach`s hungry growls in response. He wants to share it with Haru, but Haru-chan says human food isn`t healthy for cats and offers to make some cat-safe homemade food for her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
