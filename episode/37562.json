  "description" : "Kenshiro and Falco, both much worse for wear, are put in dire peril by Jakoh`s cowardly schemes. Having already sustained heavy damage all over, both men come under fire from Jakoh`s gigantic spears! Lin`s group desperately seeks to escape from their cave quickly in order to tell Falco and Kenshiro that they have no more reason to fight. Ein hammers into an iron stake with his fist until breaking through to a water vein, and the underground water pressure lets them escape. The punch he stakes his life on finally creates a miracle!\nSource: crunchyroll",
