  "description" : "Funami Yui here. For those of you watching this for the first time, the second episode`s summary is a complete lie, so there`s no reason to believe it.\nEven though she has Akari and Chinatsu-chan as juniors now, Kyoko forgot her homework again. She`ll never grow up. Well, it`s Sunday, so I`ll forget about Kyoko and lounge around...\nWhat are you doingi here?\nOh, well. With Akari and Chinatsu-chan here, I wonder what sort of Sunday this will be.\nSource: crunchyroll",
