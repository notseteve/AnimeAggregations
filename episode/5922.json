  "description" : "Gan-chan, in the form of Gabira, heads towards the kitchen. Urd multiples herself to form an army, and Urd and Skuld set up multiple lines of defense to defeat Gabira. Using toy tanks, they slow down Gabria, but fail to stop him. When the goddesses retreat to their final line of defense and play rock music, the mold is disgusted by Gan-chan`s lack of rhythm when he attempts to dance. The stereo overloads however. Keiichi finally destroys Gabira by exposing him to sunlight.",
