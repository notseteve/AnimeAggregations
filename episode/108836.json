  "description" : "Natsu and Lucy start looking for a new job to take, but just then Erza, the strongest female wizard in all of Fairy Tail, returns. She`s so powerful all the other people in Fairy Tail are scared stiff, and she immediately asks Natsu and Gray to come help her on a mission. Lucy tags along to keep the two of them from fighting, and on the train Erza tells the story of how she learned of the evil plans of Eisenwald, a dark guild, and how she intends on stopping them. But can the four of them really take on an entire guild by themselves?\nSource: crunchyroll",
