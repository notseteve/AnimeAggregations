  "description" : "The fighting continues at Italica. The eastern gate`s defences are breached, and there is fighting in the city. Rory goes into a battle frenzy, with Itami`s troops behind her. Itami has also called in a squadron of helicopter gunships, and they terminate the bandits with extreme prejudice. This awesome display of modern military firepower leaves Pina in a state of shock, and she realises that a war with them would result in their inevitable defeat. She is equally shocked that Itami does not demand crippling terms which the victors in such a battle usually do, merely requesting trade concessions in exchange for the continued sovereignty of Italica. Leilei sells the dragon scales, and the 3rd Platoon tries to return to the JSDF basecamp at Arnus Hill, only to encounter Pina`s Rose Knights, who do not yet know that the battle is already over and that Pina has negotiated an armistice. They threaten Itami, who allows himself to be captured, ordering his troops to leave him behind, to avoid more fighting.",
