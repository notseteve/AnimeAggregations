  "description" : "Byakuran is surprised at Vongola Primo’s unexpected visit. Apparently, his arrival could not be foreseen even with Byakuran’s access to parallel worlds. Yuni explains to Byakuran why Vongola Primo has come. The reason has something to do with the Sky elements of the 73 policy. Vongola Primo says that he is there to unleash them. He seems to be referring to the Vongola rings, but will this provide Tsuna the opportunity to power up?\nSource: crunchyroll",
