  "description" : "Kanekozo is a spirit born of buried money. When he tells Hyakkimaru the location of the loot, the villagers dig up the ground to find the money right where the spirit has said it was. It turns out to be the money once stolen by the horrifying monster. The female headman Bandai, who pities the villagers, has been giving them money. When Hyakkimaru hears this story, he guesses what the monster really is. At night, when the monster assaults the village again, Hyakkimaru injures the monster with the help of the villagers. The monster runs into Bandai`s mansion, where Dororo sees it transform into Bandai. As Hyakkimaru has guessed, the female headman is the monster, and she has been controlling the village by giving them money that she had taken from them in the first place. The monster turns out to be a human face-wound on her body.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
