  "description" : "Onodera is taste-testing their family sweet shop`s products when Haru points out that she seems to be getting fat. Checking on the bathroom scale shows that this seems to be true. Terrified, she starts skipping meals and refusing even her favourite foods, making Ichijou deeply concerned for her. It is only after he tells her that she looks sick and is getting too thin that she stops worrying. It turns out that the scale was broken.\nShe later reminisces of the time just before graduating from middle school, of how she had a crush on Ichijou even then. She remembers how she tried to get into Bonyari High School as that was where Ichijou planned to go, so that she could continue to say `good morning` and `see you` to him every day. She ultimately failed the entrance exam, but got in in the end because a waiting list slot was freed up for her.",
