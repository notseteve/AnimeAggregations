  "description" : "Mikado bumped into a girl with a scar on her neck on a street corner. With a sense of déjà vu he hears the sound of a whinnying horse. The girl was being chased by the headless rider. He quickly decides to keep her safe, and takes her home. However, she says she has amnesia. Unsure of what to do, Mikado speaks to Masaomi, but the only conclusion they can reach is that they have to wait and see. The next day, as Mikado returns home from school, he finds the information broker Izaya and the headless rider waiting for him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
