  "description" : "Yuu has thrown Taiki and his friends into a dark realm called Hell`s Field. Inside a castle they find a crystal that allows them to speak with Yuu, who tells them that his army has taken up camp in a castle opposite the one that Xros Heart has found. He then invites Taiki to play a game in which they each lead their armies against the opposing castle, and whichever one dies is the loser. Yuu still believes the Digital World is a game in which nobody really dies, so Kiriha comes up with a strategy to convince him that he`s wrong. Will Kiriha`s strategy succeed in showing Yuu the truth?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
