  "description" : "On the news, they talked about how the Penguin King statue at Penguin Park got ripped out of the ground and flipped upside down! That was the same day our class headed to the zoo for a field trip, where the Power card happened to show up. Power just loves to compare its strength to others, so it was breaking open cage after cage, looking for a suitable opponent. The zoo turned into total chaos, with animals escaping and running around all over the place! Finally, Sakura challenged Power to a test of strength, and just when it looked like she was about to lose, Xiaolang saved the day with his Time card and helped Sakura win the challenge!\nSource: crunchyroll",
