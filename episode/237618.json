  "description" : "Gojou has driven Hanami away with his overwhelming strength. Mahito reunites with Hanami, who`s on the verge of death, after stealing Sukuna`s fingers and the Special Grade Cursed Object, Death Painting Wombs 1 through 3. They`re steadily making progress with their preparations to seal Gojou Satoru on October 31st. Meanwhile, those with Jujutsu High are unable to discern the cursed spirits` objective. Considering the damage that was done, they nearly cancel the exchange event, but for some reason they end up settling it through baseball. It`s Day 2 of the Sister School Exchange Event, and it`s time to play ball!\nSource: crunchyroll",
