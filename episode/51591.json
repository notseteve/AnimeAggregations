  "description" : "\"I want to board the 999, too,\" says brothers, without form, who float off in the distance. Feeling pity for his brother Crosalis`s words, Aron stops the 999 in hopes of mechanizing themselves into Ghost Station No. 13. The 999 is forced to make an emergency stop on Station No.13.
