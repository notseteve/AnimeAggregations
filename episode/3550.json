  "description" : "Sakura seemed a bit preoccupied at school... I wonder if it was because of Xiaolang or Eriol. After school, Eriol invited us over to his house to say goodbye and to explain everything. It turned out that all the crazy things that had been happening were actually because of him! He was trying to help Sakura become the true master of the cards. I talked to Xiaolang to find out what Sakura had said when he revealed her how he felt, and he told me that she didn`t say anything!
