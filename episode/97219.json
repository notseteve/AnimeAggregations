  "description" : "The 17th Unit goes to the city`s spa resort for a little rest and recreation. The president is there as well, resting after collapsing from overwork the other day, and he suggests that Nina teach Felli how to swim. She is initially sceptical of the reasons why she should learn, until she sees Machen being pushed by Naruki and Miffy into being taught how to swim by Layfon.\nThe next day Layfon is asked to teach Felli how to swim. The fact that she seems to be getting so close to him bothers the president so much that he calls Layfon privately and confronts him, warning him that if he does anything to hurt Felli he will crush him, which frightens and perplexes Layfon.\nMeanwhile, a group of terrorists has invaded the spa and have taken the girls hostage at the dressing room. Nina and Felli manage to recover their dites and manage to subdue the terrorists.",
