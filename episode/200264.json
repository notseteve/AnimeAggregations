  "description" : "Just as upper managements concerned, dragon pilots` romantic feeling created a gulf between OTF and themselves. \"Anatomic\" has prevented Hisone from riding Masotan, but she hasn`t realized her true feeling yet. Nao sees Hisone struggling and reconsiders what she can do. Eru cannot ride Noma anymore and started going after her original dream. Now \"Ritual\" is only days away. Everyone at Gifu Air Base is preparing for it in different ways with mixed feeling.\nSource: Official page",
