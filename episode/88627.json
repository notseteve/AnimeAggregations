  "description" : "Nadeshiko tells the Guardians that she will be leaving for England soon. Meanwhile, Amu is having trouble deciding whether she is in love with Kukai, Tadase, or Ikuto. Amu goes to the Royal Garden to ask Nadeshiko for advice, but finds Nadeshiko she is not there. Amu then goes to Nadeshiko`s home where she encounters a mysterious boy named Nagihiko, who claims he is Nadeshiko`s older twin brother. Nagihiko runs off with Amu and takes her for a walk in a park. The two eventually visit a shrine where one can pray to have true love with their loved ones and get matching charms. The two eventually part company. When Nagihiko arrives home, he dresses up as a female and is revealed to be Nadeshiko. It is the Fujisaki family`s tradition for the males to be raised as females as part of their dance training.\nSource: crunchyroll",
