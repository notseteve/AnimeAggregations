  "description" : "After becoming a Blacksmith, Yotsuya developed two new tactical weapons to use against the orcs: the Storc for close-range combat and the Orc Eater for shooting from a distance. Although they successfully use these to fight off the orcs attacking the stronghold, the orcs learn how to throw projectiles by observing the long-range weapon. Both the humans and the orcs have suffered substantial damages as the battle enters its final stages.\nSource: crunchyroll",
