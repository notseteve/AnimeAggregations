  "description" : "Souta is sleeping with a tossing and turning Poco when his longtime friend Nakajima Shinobu shows up for an impromptu fishing trip... at 3 AM. The trio cast their lines under the Red Lighthouse, but the fish just aren’t biting. With a bored Poco playing nearby, Souta and Nakajima have a heart-to-heart about their thoughts on marriage and the future. When Souta sadly reveals that he might sell his childhood home and restaurant, Nakajima presses him to take over the restaurant, but Souta won’t give him a clear answer. Will Souta go through with selling the house? And what about Poco?\nSource: crunchyroll",
