  "description" : "Isana is coming over to the Irido house this weekend to hang out with Mizuto. Suspecting that she may not know how to properly dress for the occasion, Yume and Akatsuki invite Isana out to go clothes shopping the day before. Unfortunately, however, every outfit she tries on ends up looking inappropriate due to the size of her breasts. Akatsuki suggests that she try on something with a softer silhouette similar to Yume`s usual style, seeing this as an opportunity to pick out new clothes for Yume to try on too. Yume then reminisces about a date she had in middle school.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
