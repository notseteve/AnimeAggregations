  "description" : "Conan, Ran, and Kogoro encounter some men arguing at the hospital. They are Ryoichi and Reiji, the sons of Kenzo, president of Aizawa foods, and senior executive director Bando. Kenzo, who is inside the treatment room, is the cause of their argument. The three men begin telling Kogoro about the circumstances when Kenzo collapsed in the refrigerated warehouse when the doctor finishes treating Kenzo. Kenzo, who is now awake, tells the others that he simply fell asleep from exhaustion. However, Conan senses there is something off about Kenzo`s words and behavior.\nSource: crunchyroll",
