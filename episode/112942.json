  "description" : "Wanting to leave her name in history, Phantom Thief Reinya tries to come up with a memorable special ability. Inspired by the book \"How to be a Ninja\", she begins training in ninja techniques. However, the electric fan of her \"Hidden Leaf Technique\" leaves her in a mess, and she nearly drowns when a dragonfly perches the straw of her \"Hidden Water Technique.\" Realizing the plastic straw is too thin for the \"Hidden Water Technique,\" she replaces it with a bamboo tube just as a sparrow approaches.\nSource: crunchyroll",
