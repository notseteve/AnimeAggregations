  "description" : "Tsukuyo falls into the hands of Jiraia, her former master, and is held captive. Meanwhile Gintoki manages to survive the attack thanks to Zenzo, and he learns about Jiraia’s past. During the Amanto attack twenty years ago, Jiraia is said to have killed his own people within the Oniwabanshu, all for the sake of his devotion to the previous shogun. In the end Jiraia himself was the one to be terminated, but he managed to escape. Now his devotion is directed toward his own creation, Tsukuyo. Jiraia’s motive is to eliminate the bond that she has come to rely upon. And he intends to achieve that goal by setting fire to Yoshiwara and burning down everything!\nSource: crunchyroll",
