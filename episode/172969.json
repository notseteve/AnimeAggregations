  "description" : "Once restored, Freeza plans revenge against Goku and Future Trunks. Tagoma objects to Freeza`s plans, but Freeza promptly subdues him. When Freeza finds out that Goku has gotten much stronger since they last met, he decides to train in order to become more powerful. He reveals that, since his power was inborn, he had never felt the need to train a day in his life before now. Four months pass before Freeza and his army head for Earth. All the while, Goku and Vegeta continue their training under Whis. Jaco the Galactic Patrolman travels to Earth to inform Bulma that Freeza had been revived and that he will be approaching Earth shortly with an army of one thousand soldiers. With Freeza`s army fast approaching, Bulma gathers the remaining Z fighters to face Freeza`s army in hopes of holding out until Goku and Vegeta make it back to Earth.\nSource: Wikipedia",
