  "description" : "A dying Alucard envisions his past as Vlad the Impaler, recalling the atrocities committed against him as a child, and those he committed himself during his war against the Turks. He is shown eventually being carried off to execution, but before being beheaded, he drinks the blood of the battlefield and becomes a vampire. He is then awoken by the pleading of Seras, who is trying in vain to help him against Priest Anderson of the Vatican. Alucard manages to rip Anderson`s heart out, and crushes it, removing Helena`s Nail. The priest hears the laughter of children, and says a final \"Amen\" before dying. Suddenly, Walter appears, crushing the remains of Anderson. Shocked at the newly vampirized Walter, Integra and Seras question him, to which he replies that he now stands alone as the Angel of Death. Alucard and Walter prepare to fight, while Integra and Seras are invited aboard the Major`s zeppelin to face him. As their fight goes on, Walter is growing unstable from the vampirization procedure but Walter pierces Alucard`s heart with a pipe, only for the body to be revealed as a decoy. Alucard then appears from behind and punches Walter, the damage forcing his body`s age to regress to the young boy from 60 years ago. Alucard fully reveals himself in the form of the girl he assumed during the war, calling Walter a child who hasn`t changed in 60 years.",
