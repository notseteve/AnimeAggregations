  "description" : "MooNs has arrived at a campsite in the mountains to shoot a commercial for \"Star Curry.\" Because this is the first time one of their songs will be used in a commercial, the members are exited and getting along well. The director Ninomiya expects much from the boys, but the rest of his staff are skeptical. When Tsubasa hears them talking about MooNs, she hopes the job will teach them just how great MooNs is. However, while the shoot starts off well, a problem suddenly occurs.\nSource: crunchyroll",
