  "description" : "Shiryu and Death Mask have the ultimate showdown between good and evil. Although believing the actions he takes are for justice, Death Mask doesn`t realise the truth of his evil ways. Through damaging blows struck for purity and goodness, Shiryu manages to strip the gold armour from Death mask`s body leaving him helpless and afraid.  Unwilling to fight an unarmed saint, Shiryu removes his own protective armour to even the stakes and prepares for a battle to the death. During the battle, Shiryu discovers his own seventh-sense and defeats Death Mask; delivering him to the mouth of death. When he returns from the gates of death, Shiryu is met by Shun and discovers he has regained his sight. Together Shiryu and Shun run on to the next house to face the next gold saint who stands in their way.\nSource: crunchyroll",
