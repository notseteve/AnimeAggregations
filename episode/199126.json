  "description" : "A meeting is underway at the Free Planets Alliance Navy Integrated Tactical Operations Center to plan the Alliance`s large-scale invasion into Imperial territory. Commodore Falk, an operations staff officer, proposes a plan, but Vice Admirals Bewcock and Yang raise concerns about the dangers of invading with widely separated forces and an excessively long supply line. Meanwhile, Reinhard is concocting a plan to draw the Alliance Navy deep into Imperial territory and destroy them in one fell swoop.\nSource: crunchyroll",
