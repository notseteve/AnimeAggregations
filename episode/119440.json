The letter she left for Agnes mentioned something called the `Waterwheel of the Heavens`, and how it was related to the mysterious meteor shower activity. Carina and Agnes research this mysterious artefact, but find nothing new.\nMeanwhile, Minette meets with her friend Miriam again, and she says that she wants to give a present to her cat. Leicester suggests they give it a bell that uses an Ale Crystal. The two of them help Leicester make these bells, but as they are finishing Miriam collapses just as a meteor shower falls on the city.
