  "description" : "While they were practicing for an upcoming marathon, Meiling ended up losing to Sakura. Enraged, she began to train intently for the difficult race. And when the day of the race arrived, Meiling and Sakura found themselves quickly in the lead. However... they soon realized that they`d been going around and around in circles with no idea why! Sakura and Xiaolang then both sensed the Loop card, so they tracked it down and sealed it away. In the process, Meiling had hurt her leg and had to be carried on Xiaolang`s back.
