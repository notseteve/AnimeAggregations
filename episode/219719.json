  "description" : "After being touched by Mamako’s motherly kindness, Pocchi and his friends changed their ways and went home to their mothers. As a way of saying thank you, the mothers agree to join the With Mommy guild, and help the party clear the tower. There are still a lot of children who are working for Amante. And so the party, now filled with mothers, heads off to the tower, gossiping and chatting all the way. When this not-very-adventurous party makes it inside the dungeon, they’re met by Amante,  who’s gotten sick of waiting for them. She challenges Mamako to… a washing and cleaning contest?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
