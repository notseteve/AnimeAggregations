  "description" : "As Nonoha visits some kindergarten students, their teacher, Madoka, gives Kaito a letter, which the others suspect to be a love letter. Suspicious about the contents, Nonoha and Gammon follows Kaito to the meeting point, where it`s revealed Madoka is a Giver following in her late fiancée`s footsteps. Kaito, Nonoha, Gammon and Madoka, along with some children, become trapped in a Kenja Puzzle inside an abandoned building, which wasn`t what Madoka expected. Nonoha works to calm the children down while Kaito solves the puzzles. When the last puzzle gets destroyed due to falling debris, Nonoha`s photographic memory allows her to recreate the puzzle, allowing Kaito, Gammon and the children to solve it, revealing a statue of Florence Nightingale which Nonoha donates to poor children. As a result, Nonoha ends up with the title `Nightingale`, which doesn`t exactly please her.\nSource: Wikipedia",
