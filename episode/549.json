  "description" : "While Chiharu is cramming for her university application, Kyouichi has traveled to Hokkaido in his summer holidays. Right after his arrival he literally runs into an attractive blond girl who offers him to take him along on her motorbike.\nKyouichi soon learns this girl is creating and selling wooden carvings. She constantly teases the naive boy, inventing ever new stories about her former boyfriend, and inviting Kyouichi to stay at her studio. But at the same time she can understand him very well, being a fellow artist - and she can read his drawings in a way Kyouichi couldn`t do by himself. And her name is \"Chiharu\".",
