  "description" : "The Galactic Imperial Navy, led by High Admiral Reinhardt, launches an attack on the Free Planets Alliance. The latter has surrounded them on three sides with forces that double the Imperial Navy`s in number, but it has divided into three fleets for its encirclement, so Reinhard executes a strategy to destroy two of the fleets individually. During the battle, the flagship Brünhild taps the Free Planets Alliance`s communications and intercepts a message saying \"All that matters is that we win in the end.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
