  "description" : "Yuta and Rin take a fishing boat and capture a mermaid to save Rin`s father. The Sakagami islanders, who followed them to sea, kill the mermaid and Yuta, taking Rin to Sakagami. Rin sees Isago there and realizes Isago is immortal. Isago reveals that she has been pregnant for three years by her previous husband, whom the Sakagami islanders killed, and that she needs mermaid flesh so she can finally give birth. A revived Yuta arrives to save Rin. The chief and his men alternately fight Yuta and Rin and eat mermaid flesh. Those who don`t die from the mermaid flesh, including the chief, become Deformed Ones. She also tells the chief that she too is a mermaid. Isago runs away and jumps off a cliff into the ocean. Yuta and Rin think Isago did it in desperation, but Isago, now in mermaid form, swims away trailed by two smaller forms. On Toba, Rin`s father recovers on his own, without mermaid flesh. Back in the present, Mana asks Yuta how far the ocean goes.\nSource: Wiki",
