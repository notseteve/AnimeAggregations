  "description" : "In the middle of the battle against the demons on the artificial island, Kisara was stabbed by a spear before Shu`s eyes. Saved by Ayano and Sharon, Shu helplessly evacuates from the fight when he sees the person he`s been looking for—his younger sister, Kanna. Then, humanity`s desperate resistance, backed by the focused efforts of Bayron City, proves futile as the extent of the large-scale disasters caused by Kanna, now certified as an S-Class demon, expand. Kisara collapsed due to her injuries and lost consciousness as her vitals disappeared. Unable to move, Shu just stares at her. And as if responding to his heart, Kisara gently awakens.\nSource: crunchyroll",
