  "description" : "Souta`s made his decision: he`s quitting his job and moving back to Kagawa, where he`ll work freelance while taking care of Poco. What with all the cooking and trying to keep his little charge out of too much mischief, though, he quickly remembers that parenting a small child is easier said than done. Thankfully, he has a \"senpai\" to turn to in Manabe-san. Can Souta handle a trip to a Gaogao-chan show in Ritsurin Garden with both Poco and Manabe-san`s daughter in tow?\nSource: crunchyroll",
