  "description" : "On a hot day when mirages are appearing, Hajime and the others are searching for the remote control for the air conditioner. After they search through \"Hako-bune,\" they find a pile of remote controls and start testing them. The one for the air conditioning is nowhere to be found, and it gets hotter and more uncomfortable. As it gets hotter, Kaya notices that Arashi is acting funny, and she becomes scared of her. As the number of remotes to test dwindles, Arashi can no longer bear the heat and goes crazy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
