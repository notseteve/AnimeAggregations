  "description" : "It turned out that the new Clow Reed was really Eriol! We were all so confused. Eriol told us that he was actually the incarnation of Clow Reed. He used his magic to darken the sky and put everyone without magical powers to sleep! When I woke up, Sakura said that to save everyone, she had needed to change the rest of the cards to Sakura Cards. I`m glad that she`s so strong! Eriol disappeared though, so we didn`t get any answer from him, but Xiaolang finally told Sakura about his feelings!\nSource: crunchyroll",
