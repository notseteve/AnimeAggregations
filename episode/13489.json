  "description" : "Although upset, the remaining bronze saints realize they don’t have the time to grieve for their brave friend Shiryu, and they hurry off to the next house, the house of Aquarius. Inside, they encounter the gold saint of Aquarius, Camus. To prove his great mentor worng (for freezing him in the large block of ice, bexause he felt Cygnus could never achieve his seventh sense) Cygnus Hyoga wants to fight Camus alone. So, he tells Shun and Seiya to go on ahead to defeat Arles without him. Camus’s powers are great; he is far superior to Cygnus and easily defeats him. But respecting his prodigy, Camus again chooses to freeze Cygnus inside a large block of ice rather than killing him ruthlessly. This time, however, to Camus’s surprise Cygnus is able to summon his seventh sense power and break out of the ice coffin. A greater battle ensues and both saints destroyed one another, altering the number of fallen bronze saints to three.\nSource: crunchyroll",
