  "description" : "Shokei is saved by a man named Kantai.  Kantai tells her about Shoko and Gao, and Shokei feels obligated to report them to Kei-o, so Kei-o won’t repeat the same mistake of being ignorant as she did.  Suzu and Kosho talk about the two tyrants and completely agree on negative views on them.  Suzu tells Yoko about Kokan’s good reputation among people and Yoko gets frustrated about her decision she made on him in the past.  Yoko goes back to the Rike to find dead Rangyoku and injured Kei-Kei.\nSource: crunchyroll",
