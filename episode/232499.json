  "description" : "Yuzaki Nasa was preparing for his high school entrance exams one snowy night when he spots a beautiful girl on the other side of the road. Feeling somewhat drawn to her, he walks towards the girl and is severely injured after getting run over by a truck. Despite hanging on for dear life, Nasa still walks over to the girl and knowing this may indeed be his last chance, confesses his feelings for her. She replies, “I’ll go out with you if you marry me.” Nasa immediately agrees but then loses consciousness. A few years later, he keeps busy at his part-time job, believing they’ll be reunited again someday. One day, someone randomly shows up at his doorstep. It happens to be the girl he shared that fateful encounter with.\nSource: crunchyroll",
