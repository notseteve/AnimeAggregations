  "description" : "Maki`s strength is fully tested by the Fukamichi Ranking. Maki easily defeats the 17th ranked fighter but waiting at the side is a dangerous looking fighter, her opponent. He says \"Welcome to the Sniper Karate course.\" There is also a man who has come to Tokyo after hearing of Maki`s spectacular fights. The leader of the Ranking, Fukamichi himself, invited him and it`s none other than Kinjiro Kitaeda. Instead of fighting a rematch with the Air Master he opts to join the Fukamichi Ranking. Nagato overhears Fukamichi say \"Kinjiro Kitaeda, I want you,\" while recruiting him. Nagato says \"What did you just say to Kin-chan?\" Nagato is in a blind rage of jealousy due to those words. Fukamichi, who just came to recruit him, is unfazed and taunts Nagato. This doesn`t look like it`ll end smoothly!\nSource: crunchyroll",
