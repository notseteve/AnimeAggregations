  "description" : "As each of Rintaro`s attempts to save Mayuri keep ending in failure, he learns that from Moeka that the lab was targeted by SERN due to their creation of a time machine and their plan to publicly announce it. Falling into despair over his repeated failures, Rintaro is approached by Kurisu, who gets him to reveal his situation and gives him key trigger phrases to get her past self to cooperate with him. After being sent to just before the time leap machine`s completion, Rintaro manages to obtain Kurisu`s aid before they are both approached by Suzuha. She explains that in order to save Mayuri, they need to escape the \"Alpha World Line Attractor Field\", where Mayuri is doomed to die, due to the converging nature of world lines, and cross the 1% Divergence point to the Beta World Line, where the outcome might possibly be different. Suzuha then takes Rintaro and Kurisu to the crashed satellite, which turns out to be a time machine, and reveals she is in fact \"John Titor\" and has come from the year 2036. \nSource: Wikipedia",
