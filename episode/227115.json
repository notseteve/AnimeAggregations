  "description" : "When Goh’s Darmanitan challenges Scorbunny to use a Fire-type move, Scorbunny tries as hard as it can but comes up short. It begins training hard so it can use the move Ember, but Goh sees things differently and thinks Scorbunny should focus on the moves it already knows—much to Scorbunny’s sadness and anger. Later, during a run-in with Team Rocket, Goh devises a way for Scorbunny to use its own version of Ember. The move works, and Scorbunny defeats Team Rocket…and also evolves into Raboot! Goh is thrilled, but Raboot seems aloof and walks past its Trainer. What could be wrong?\nSource: Official Website",
