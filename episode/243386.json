  "description" : "Normally Paula visits Kirio Drugstore every day in hopes of scoring a free meal, but for the past week she hasn`t been showing up. Reiji is concerned and goes to her tool shop to check on her, where oddly enough, she is studying. Reiji is surprised, so Paula explains that the exam to renew the license she needs to make her customers comfortable doing business with her is tomorrow, and she is currently studying for that. However, the results of her practice test were terrible, and Paula begs Reiji for help.\nSource: crunchyroll",
