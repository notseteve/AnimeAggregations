  "description" : "Yucie and Glenda are sent off to find the next crystal flower. With the help of Gaga, the two are sent into the Demon World where they have to work together and figure it out with no real help. For Glenda, returning to the Demon World puts her firmly in her element, but not as she`d like. For Yucie, it`s seeing all those things you normally fear being brought to reality. Unfortunately for both, the Demon Realm isn`t what it used to be by a long stretch. One of the reasons Glenda wants to take over in this world is that her father is set on a remodeling project of the entire world that`ll make it more tourist friendly. So things like the evil looking range of mountains have blue bows and candies across it. The sky has pastel flowers littered through it. It`s just far too cute. And even getting to meet the lord of the demon world is amusing since he`s thrown his back out while doing all the redecorating.\nSource: tv.com",
