  "description" : "The Vatican forces led by Enrico Maxwell begin to attack the remaining Millennium forces along with the surviving citizens of London. Walter, now a vampire, joins forces with the Major. Alexander Anderson is enraged because he believes Maxwell has become drunk with power and is abusing God`s power. The armed priests led by Heinkel Wolfe and Yumie Takagi come close to capturing Integra, but Seras saves her. Alucard, appearing in the Eagle, now returns to London and joins the battle encountering the two other trump cards Anderson and The Captain. Integra releases his Control Art Restriction to Level Zero allowing Alucard to summon millions of Familiars to the battle. Enrico Maxwell and Anderson realize that Alucard is in fact Count Dracula/Vlad the impaler. Alucard`s forces easily overwhelm all of the Iscariot and Millennium forces and Maxwell is killed shortly after. Alucard meets up with Integra and Seras. Anderson and Alucard fight each other but Alucard has the upper hand and the remaining priests come to aid Anderson against Alucard. Anderson uses Helena`s Nail to become a monster against Alucard, setting him and his familiars ablaze.",
