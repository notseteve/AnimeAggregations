  "description" : "Kawasaki Frontale takes on FC Tokyo in the J League 30th anniversary match. Conan and the Detective Boys have fun participating in the special event. However, once the event ends and they return to their seats, for some reason Haibara is in a bad mood. She wanted to enter the pitch holding hands with her favorite player Higo of Big Osaka, but she showed up on the wrong day. Haibara expresses her disappointment over her team`s loss and Sanada`s poor play... only to realize Sanada is standing right next to her! While watching the match together, Haibara notices something odd in the stands.\nSource: crunchyroll",
