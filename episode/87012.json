  "description" : "Lawrence enlists the help of the Milone Company to counter Zeelen`s scheme. However, men from the Medioh Company, Zeelen`s associates, try to ambush Lawrence and Holo at night. Holo and Lawrence flee to the Milone Company but Holo acts as a diversion so Lawrence can escape to safety. After arriving at safety, Lawrence is told that Milone Company has all the information needed to defeat Zeelen and the Medioh Company`s plan and no longer needs Lawrence. To compound Lawrence`s problems, a letter arrives from Medioh informing him that they know Holo is a wolf and are prepared to hand her over to the church.\nSource: Wikipedia",
