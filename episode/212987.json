  "description" : "Kaguya and Shirogane had an argument over the \"home visit incident\" and as they`re both unable to be honest about their feelings, a hostile mood pervades the student council room. Since Kashiwagi has a boyfriend, Kaguya goes to her for \"romantic advice,\" although she lies, saying she`s \"asking for a friend.\" Meanwhile, when Shirogane asks romcom fan Ishigami how he can make up with the \"person of the opposite sex\" he had a fight with, the class treasurer goes off on a heated rant... After getting an earful of various advice, Kaguya and Shirogane begin to realize how they really feel about each other.\nSource: crunchyroll",
