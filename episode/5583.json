  "description" : "A man named Goson captures Taiki to be a king in a wrong way, but Chief Shin saves Taiki.  Now the lady priests are worried about two things: Taiki cannot transform into Kirin’s original shape to choose a king; he does not have Shireis(servants) to guard himself.  Lady Gyokuyo invites Keiki to see Taiki.  They have trouble communicating at first but later become friends.  Keiki motivates Taiki to practice transformation and catching Shireis.  Keiki also learns to be understanding people’s feelings instead of being right, which improves his relationship with Kei-o.\nSource: crunchyroll",
