  "description" : "Hibari’s Vongola Box Weapon is shaped like handcuffs. Daisy is surprised to see a Vongola Box Weapon for the first time. The real six Funeral Wreaths know about Tsuna and the gang’s special attacks because Byakuran provided them with information from the parallel worlds. However, the Vongola Boxes only exist in this world, so they have not obtained any information on them. But Daisy laughs and says these weapons are very suitable for him. What does he mean by that? Tsuna and his friends are hiding at Kawahira Real Estate, and when Dino stops corresponding from Nami Middle, they find themselves completely in the dark about the battle going on there.\nSource: crunchyroll",
