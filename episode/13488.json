  "description" : "Shiryu manages to break Shura’s arm, but is badly wounded in the process. Just like at the beginning of our story, when Shiryu battled Seiya in the Galactian Wars Tournament, as Shiryu attacked Shura with his “Rising Dragon” Technique he left his heart unprotected for a split second, and this is all Shura needed to deliver his damaging blow. Realising that Shura must be defeated in order to save Athena, Shiryu uses his most powerful technique the “Ultimate Dragon”. Although this technique will kill any one it is used against, it will also ensure Shiryu’s own death. So, Shiryu chooses to sacrifice himself for the cause of saving Athena, and he defeats Shura of Capricorn. But is Shiryu really dead?\nSource: crunchyroll",
