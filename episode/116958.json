  "description" : "Mom and the family head to Cambodia over spring break. Dad is supposed to meet them there, but he`s not at the designated meeting spot. The three begin to head to their destination, Angkor Wat, alone... As they walk on the road to Angkor Wat, some young boys greet them, selling coconut milk. Arriving in Angkor Wat, confused as to how to find their hotel, Dad suddenly shows up sporting a surprising look! He quickly scurries them off to show them Tonle Sap Lake. One thing about Cambodia you should know, is that children have to work very hard there. The working conditions are very poor. However, the smile on their faces is more beautiful than anywhere else. Mom and Dad both love that part of Cambodia.\nSource: crunchyroll",
