  "description" : "The final episode uncovers the origin of Project Robin. It is here that Amon and Robin confronts Zaizen in a final showdown to uncover the truth behind Todo`s project. The episode ends off with the Factory destroyed, and most of the STN-J escaping unharmed. The only exceptions are Amon and Robin who have either escaped or been killed in the resulting collapse of the Factory. At the ending, the reactions of the various other characters hinted at them being alive but are said to be dead for their own safety. After the ending song, there is a scene in which a woman wearing similar clothes like Robin comes out of a taxi as a new hunter for STN-J.\nSource: Wikipedia",
