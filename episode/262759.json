  "description" : "Wendy Sato has determined that she is going to walk the path of solitude, just like her father she admired. But it`s not so easy. Despite herself, she`s late for work from oversleeping, and gets hammered at Finn`s welcome party. At this rate, she will not be anything like her father, let alone mastering the power of the ace of spades inherited from her father, \"Love and Peace.\" That`s when High Card is put in a tight spot by a player from the Klondike family.\nSource: crunchyroll",
