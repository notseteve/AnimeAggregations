  "description" : "In Asgard, Hyoga is escaping with a young girl named Freya, Hilda`s younger sister. Asgard soldiers trap Hyoga and try to convince Freya to come back to her sister, but she refuses, hoping that Athena will save her sister. Hyoga defeats the soldiers. Then, Saori appears before Hyoga and Freya. Seiya, Shun and Kiki arrive, and Freya explains that Hilda is not acting like herself. The worst part is, the world is now in danger. Hilda was praying to stop the Polar ice caps from melting, but since Hilda stopped praying, the ice caps are melting and will flood the Earth. Hilda and her God Warriors suddenly appear before them. Saori notices the ring on Hilda`s finger. The ring is known as the Nibelung Ring, which turns its wearer evil. The Bronze Saints set out to reach the Valhalla Palace and remove the ring from Hilda`s finger in order to bring Hilda back to normal. Saori decides to stop the Polar ice caps from melting, but with her power, she can only contain the caps for 12 hours, before the sun sets. Hilda and her God Warriors leave, while Phecda Gamma Thor volunteers to stop the Saints.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
