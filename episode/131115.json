  "description" : "Taiki, Nene, and Kiriha are once again bound tightly by their strong friendship, giving rise to Shoutmon X7! With his ultimate attack, Shoutmon X7 at last defeats Gravimon... but he is reborn again thanks to a \"heart\" hidden somewhere in his castle. As long as his heart survives, Gravimon can come back to life infinitely. So Nene slips into the castle to destroy the heart while Taiki and Kiriha engage Gravimon in battle to draw him away from her search. Taiki attacks with a new seven-way Xros based upon Cutemon... but can they hold Gravimon off long enough for Nene to find his heart?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
