  "description" : "Kaito is contacted by Genius Okudera, a man he once saved from a ruin, who invites him, Nonoha and Ana to a puzzle-themed hotel resort in Hokkaido to solve an alleged Kenja Puzzle being displayed as the centrepiece. After spending a day of activites, Kaito starts to solve the puzzle the next day, becoming suspicious that there aren`t any traps involved. As Kaito comes close to solving the puzzle, which he deduces to not be a Kenja Puzzle, he almost succumbs to sabotage but is saved by Nonoha and Ana. Upon solving the puzzle, they find the treasure is a view of nature which has become ruined because of construction of an amusement park. Having painted a picture of what the landscape originally looked like, Ana helps the hotel owner remember the times he spent with his grandfather who created the puzzle, deciding to cancel construction and work on rebuilding the forest.\nSource: Wikipedia",
