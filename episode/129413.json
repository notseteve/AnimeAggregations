  "description" : "The Devil Snake`s cries cause the entrance to the cave to cave in, and its acid spitting and regenerative abilities prove difficult for Toriko and Coco. Meanwhile, Komatsu is taken captive by another hunter looking for the Puffer Whale. As Coco tries to distract the Devil Snake so Toriko can gather power, he is injected with its venom. However, he manages to make some antibodies for it and inject them into the snake along with his own poison, allowing Toriko to unleash his 5-Fold Spiked Punch on it. As Toriko contemplates what to do with the meat, Komatsu and his kidnapper encounter another Demon Devil Snake.\nSource: Wikipedia",
