  "description" : "While Ash and Goh eat delectable treats (thanks to Greedent’s eating contest victory), Team Rocket plans to steal Pikachu by switching it with a lookalike called “Practically Pikachu.” When they appear to succeed and make their getaway via bicycle, Lucario and Cinderace chase after them! In response, Meowth shoots a bouncy glue at the two Pokémon, and they end up stuck together. Although this presents real challenges, Lucario and Cinderace figure out a way to work together and send Team Rocket flying. But when they return to Ash and Goh, the two Pokémon are shocked—the real Pikachu had been safely by Ash’s side all along!\nSource: Official Website",
