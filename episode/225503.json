  "description" : "I`m Mazama Jin, a first-year at Secon Academy. It`s been nothing but smooth sailing in the cooking club I started with my beloved Hitomi-chan, and all kinds of rumors have been going around about what we do there! Will this draw in some more new members? Right after I asked that, two unfamiliar students showed up for a surprising reason! An exciting incident is in store for me and Hitomi-chan! Or... that`s what would`ve happened if those two students weren`t a dumb lion and a dumb naked mole-rat.\nSource: crunchyroll",
