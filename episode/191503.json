  "description" : "The Akudarma Trio go to early 20th century London in order to find Arthur Conan Doyle. When they get there, they hear a sudden scream. A man says that someone had stolen his ring that was locked up in his safe. He suspects that the trio might be the culprits, and then Doyle suddenly appears. He solves the case the same way that Holmes would have, but apparently he’s looking for new stories. Tokio and Calen also get involved and they start a case-solving battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
