  "description" : "While in the town of Patzuille, Lawrence decides to purchase a better set of clothes for Holo. However, Lawrence only has a gold piece, too large denomination to purchase clothes. They return to Weiz, intending to exchange it for silver and agree to meet later at a tavern for drinks. Lawrence uses a \"secret technique\" to buy clothes for Holo that were once worn by a noble. He first buys cheap blankets at an inflated price to buy the expensive clothes at an extremely cheap price, made even cheaper by Holo`s charm. Though the clothing merchant makes a profit on the blankets, he loses money on the entire deal because of the more expensive clothes.\nSource: Wikipedia",
