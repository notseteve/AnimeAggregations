  "description" : "With the Sowing of the Fool, Juudai`s deck is whittled away quickly, leaving him in a bind. Just then, he hears the voice of the Winged Kuribo and manages to counterattack, the upright position of the Dark Ruler allowing him to attack twice during battle phase 2. Cornered and left with only 13 cards, Juudai hears Mizuchi`s voice asking him to save Saiou. Knowing that the only way to save Saiou is to defeat him, Juudai steels his nerve and confronts Saiou.\nSource: crunchyroll",
