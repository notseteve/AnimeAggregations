Team 7, along with Katasuke and Chamaru, the Ninja Hound, go to the location where their communications cut out and they are attacked by mysterious puppets. Believing these puppets to be advanced Scientific Ninja Tools, Katasuke fights them with tools of his own. After disabling the puppets, Chamaru helps Boruto and the others pinpoint Konohamaru and Mugino’s location. But when they do, Ao appears before them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
