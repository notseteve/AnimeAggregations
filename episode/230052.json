  "description" : "Continuing their Galar region trip, Ash and Goh are perplexed when their food disappears in front of their eyes! It’s the work of a timid Pokémon named Sobble, who becomes invisible whenever it touches water. And when it cries, everyone cries! Goh catches it, but when he sends it into battle, Sobble becomes overwhelmed and runs away. It gets captured by Team Rocket, who can’t resist crying along with it. Luckily, Goh thinks of a way to block the effects of Sobble’s tears, so he and Ash send Team Rocket blasting off again! Goh apologizes to Sobble, and the little Pokémon is once again overwhelmed—this time with joy!\nSource: Official Website",
