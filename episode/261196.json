  "description" : "Gaojun uncharacteristically appears lonely. Though Shouxue is concerned, she is unable to ask why. Several days later, Gaojun visits Ye Ming Palace to show her a haunted mask. The ghost haunting the mask apparently responds to a type of foreign lute. The problem is solved when Gaojun is able to provide such a lute. Gaojun tries to leave, but he is stopped by Shouxue.\nSource: crunchyroll",
