  "description" : "After finding that Guilmon has no intention to kill him, Takato is in awe of the fact he is now partner to a real Digimon, in spite of the difficulty he has in sneaking the dinosaur past his parents. All the while, Rika Nonaka (notably the girl from Takato`s dream in the first episode), a digimon tamer and her digimon, Renamon, easily defeat a Goblimon. Takato leaves Guilmon alone while he goes to school, but Guilmon follows him and causes chaos in the school, leaving Takato in a panic. Whilst searching for his wayward partner, Takato meets his friend Henry Wong and his digimon Terriermon. Takato`s concerns about lacking worthiness to tame Guilmon are subdued when he finds Guilmon again. While looking for a place for Guilmon to stay, they`re attacked by Renamon and Rika, to Takato`s horror.\nSource: crunchyroll",
