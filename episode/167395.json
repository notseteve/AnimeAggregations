  "description" : "New jobs are assigned to the group, and Isla and Tsukasa are given a job that involves retrieving a giftia that raised a young boy after the deaths of his parents, one of the so-called \"android children\". They are greeted warmly by the giftia, called Marsha, and meet the boy, Wakanae Souta, who is deeply troubled by the impending loss of Marsha, telling them that everything she tells them are all lies. They cannot accept his signature that way. The next day, Michiru hears about the story and offers to help since like Souta she was also an android child herself. They go over some old family pictures with Marsha and they tell him that the next day is the boy`s birthday, and they find the secret recipe for the strawberry tart that his mother used to make. Michiru suddenly shows up, changing her mind yet again, and with her help they manage to throw a birthday party for Souta that helps him to accept what will happen to Marsha.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Yamanobe is called to a meeting with upper management and is told that his section`s overhead is the highest in the terminal services division, and he needs to come up with a plan to cut their costs or else one will be dictated upon him.\nThe day before Marsha is scheduled to be retrieved a man impersonating SAI`s terminal services personnel shows up at the Wakanae house, and tries to convince Souta to give her up to him.",
