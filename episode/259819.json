  "description" : "\"This was around the time I made my debut. For a while back then, I didn`t have anything to smile about at all.\"\nThe twelve members of VAZZY and ROCK DOWN gather to talk on a special TV program being made in anticipation of December`s VAZZROCK Live Flawless concert. Part way through, the topic shifts to Takaaki, Ouka, and Yuma`s roles in the upcoming TV drama Shuten. The new show is a spin-off of Sokai, an earlier feature film about the life of Shoin Yoshida. On set, the three are reunited with two of their former costars; talented actors Yusho Toi and Yuzuru Mikaduki. While Ouka grumbles about working with the difficult Toi again, Takaaki keeps smiling and tries to lighten the mood.\nSource: crunchyroll",
