  "description" : "While walking on the street Takumi bumps into a strange girl carrying a sword that others can`t see but Takumi can see it. Kishimoto Ayase, the real name of FES, transfers into Takumi`s school. On the way home, Ban Yasuji and Suwa Mamoru, two detectives of the police department, ask Takumi about the recent murder cases. Takumi buys a new figurine of Seira so Rimi comes by to visit. Ayase tells Takumi that something called a Di-Sword can save him so he goes to find and buy one, though later recognized as a counterfeit. Nanami stops by for a visit but leaves angrily, breaking the sword. Orihara Kozue, the girl who was moving to Tokyo from the last episode is now a transfer student at Takumi`s school. Takumi wanders the streets of Shibuya and has a delusion that he and an old man in a wheelchair are the only ones left in the world. The man claims he is Shogun and tells Takumi to hurry up and awaken, or else more people will die. Rimi snaps him out of it and Takumi heads home, thanking her. \nSource: Wikipedia",
