  "description" : "The magician reveals that his name is Stiyl Magnus and explains that his partner Kaori Kanzaki unintentionally hurt Index as her magical garb was supposed to stop the blow. His mission was actually to protect Index, who possesses photographic memory of the 103,000 grimoires implanted in her mind called the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Angered by Stiyl`s harsh treatment of Index, Touma attacks him, to which Stiyl responds by using fire magic and is surprised when Tōma nullifies the spell. To stop Touma, Stiyl summons a fire creature known as Innocentius. When Touma finds himself unable to negate the creature, Index activates John`s Pen, her self-protection system personality, to reveal that Innocentius` power comes from runes placed around the building. Touma defeats Stiyl and Innocentius by setting off sprinklers to wash away the runes. However, because of Index`s wounds and Touma`s inability to use magic, he brings Index to the only non-esper he knows, that being his teacher Komoe Tsukuyomi.\nSource: wikipedia",
