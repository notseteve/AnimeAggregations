  "description" : "Walter Park is filled with so many fun things! All of the students do their best to have the most fun so that their team can win their competition. Clara and Opera`s team has fun trying on cute clothes, and Jazz and Kalego`s team tries their hand at shooting games. Each team happens to meet members of the Walter Park staff and continue to have fun. Iruma and Balam`s team is joined by Ronove but Iruma ends up having too much fun and getting lost and ends up going down a shady looking alley!\nSource: crunchyroll",
