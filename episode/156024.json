  "description" : "After Masato, it`s time to recruit Kengo into the Little Busters. But Kengo seems to know something and tries to stop Riki from recruiting members, telling him that if he continues, he`ll only find darkness in the end. Riki, Rin and Masato ponder whether there`s a way to bring Kengo into their group and continue rebuilding the Little Busters. But Riki is determined to become the leader that Kyousuke once was, and resolves to convince Kengo using force. At that moment, Rin holds up a ball and suggests that they challenge him in baseball.\nSource: crunchyroll",
