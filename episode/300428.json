  "description" : "Eren finds himself alone on a roof with Armin, burnt near death, and the unconscious Bertholdt. The Cart Titan arrives, and the blond man asserts that Eren`s father lied to him. He promises a confused Eren that he will save him before fleeing. Hange takes Ymir`s letter from Reiner`s possession but the Cart Titan rescues Reiner before she can kill him. Mikasa finds Levi about to inject Armin with the serum to save him. However, when Floch Forster, the only surviving recruit from the suicide charge, arrives with Erwin, also close to death, Levi chooses Erwin instead, causing Eren and Mikasa to defy him and attack him in grief. Hange calms them down and takes them away. Alone now, Levi remembers a conversation with Erwin and ultimately chooses to let the Commander finally rest in peace, injecting Armin instead. Armin becomes a Titan and eats Bertholdt, gaining the power of the Colossal Titan. Levi and Hange mourn the deceased Erwin while the squad extracts a healed Armin from his Titan form.",
