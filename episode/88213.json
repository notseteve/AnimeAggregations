  "description" : "On the way home from a park, Amu`s parents get into an argument about when they first went on a date. Eventually, they make up, but when they search for the photo Amu`s father took when he first met with Amu`s mother, they discover that it was missing. Amu`s parents get into another argument because Amu`s father placed the photo in a bird magazine and Amu`s mother donated the magazine to a bazaar. With the help of Nadeshiko and Yaya, Amu searches the bazaar for the magazine and eventually finds it. However, Yoru steals the magazine thinking it contains a clue about the Embryo. Amu chases after Yoru in order to get the picture back, but the picture is torn in the process. Amu and Su transforms into Amulet Clover and use Remake Honey to repair the picture and a broken clock.\nSource: crunchyroll",
