As this rumor spreads, Yuuto comes to Mana with a story about his friend saying he will become a ghost, then disappearing. Kitaro has received a lot of letters about exactly the same thing. Apparently, if you speak an incantation at the graveyard on Third Street, Fourth Street, which shouldn`t exist, appears and you can go to the ghost school. In the middle of the night, Kitaro goes to try the incantation, and another dimension appears before his eyes. As he advances deeper into the space, he finds a school where children seem to be happily taking classes. The teachers there are yokai Kitaro had already defeated.
