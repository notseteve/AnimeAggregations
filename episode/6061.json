  "description" : "The peace of a routine day is shattered by violent explosions. With the citizens of the world trembling in terror, Goku knows that he is the target of the vicious assault - and the devastating power of the attacks can mean only one thing: Androids. A mysterious fiend is creating Androids that are faster, stronger, and far more deadly than anything ever devised by the deceased Doctor Gero. Goku and the rest of the Z fighters will have to find the identity of the murderous mastermind if they are to halt the onslaught of his lethal inventions.\nSource: crunchyroll",
