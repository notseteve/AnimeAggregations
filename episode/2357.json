  "description" : "We all took a school trip to the aquarium, where Sakura witnessed the spirit of the Watery card! Afterwards, she wound up there again when she went on her lovely date with Yukito, her brother`s best friend (which I caught on film!). Later that night, she, Kero and I all snuck into the aquarium and put our plan into motion! Sakura managed to lure Watery into a giant freezer, where it quickly turned to ice, allowing Sakura to capture it with no trouble!\nSource: crunchyroll",
