  "description" : "Lin and Maoto announce the Release Battle, and the three idol groups, PROTOSTAR, LEGIT, and JAXX/JAXX discuss what motif they plan to use for their live performances. As is normal for LEGIT, Daiki and Eishiro argue due to their different opinions concerning the direction of the band, but Fuga says something offhand that settles the matter. With that, Fuga finally feels like he`s contributing to the band for the first time, but he realizes something as he reflects upon himself for the motif.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
