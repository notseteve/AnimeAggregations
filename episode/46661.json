In contemporary Japan, however, nobody would believe that she has been attacked by Dracula. So the residents who have found her take the assault to have been by an animal when they see the wounds, made by sharp teeth, on her neck. Moreover, it has been in the news that a tiger and a panda have escaped during transport and are wandering about the neighborhood. People think it is the tiger that has attacked her, and try to capture the panda and shoot the tiger. As Chocola has become friends with the animals, she gets angry with the people, wondering why they do not try to save both animals.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
