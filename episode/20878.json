  "description" : "It`s wintertime, and Laura and Kana bump into their teacher, Mr. Yoshi, while ice-skating in the mountains. Mr. Yoshi invites them back to his mother`s house. His mother, the gifted ghost-story teller who gave Laura and Kana shivers in the summertime with her story of hamster-hunting ghosts, has more tales to entertain our friends. This time, Laura, Kana, and the Ham-Hams tremble as Mr. Yoshi`s mother tells them about a mysterious snow woman who haunts the mountain. On the way home, Laura, Kana, the Ham-Hams, and Mr. Yoshi all get separated in the woods. \nSource: Wikipedia",
