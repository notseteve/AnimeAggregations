  "description" : "Teenage boy Masato Oosuki was chosen to beta test a new MMORPG, where you’re actually teleported inside the world of the game. After Masumi Shirase comes to give him a brief explanation, he’s off to start a new life inside a video game! But once he gets there, he finds his mother, Mamako, has followed him.  He’s bewildered, but Mamako is overjoyed at the idea of going on an adventure with her son. And her regular attack skill is incredibly strong, too. Masato’s attack skill only has regular power, and as a normal rebellious teenager, he’s more than a little upset to find his grand fantasy adventure ruined. And thus begins a new RPG journey, with mom in tow!\nSource: crunchyroll",
