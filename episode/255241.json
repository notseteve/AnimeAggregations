  "description" : "After Kanade rejects his confession of love, Shikijou presses her for a reason, grabbing her arm and saying, \"This isn`t normal. This isn`t like you.\" Kanade throws him by reflex, then Shikijou flies into a rage and turns a stun gun on her!\nWhen Kanade slowly regains consciousness, she finds herself in a dimly lit abandoned warehouse where a group of delinquents are chatting and laughing. Kanade`s hands and feet are tied with rope, so she can`t move. Shikijou moves closer to her saying, \"Kanade-san, you aren`t normal right now. We have to reform you.\"\nSource: Crunchyroll",
