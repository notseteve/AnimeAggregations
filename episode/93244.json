  "description" : "Amu is walking along when the Guardians meet up with her. Yaya praises Amu for her powered-up Humpty Lock. With her classmates, Amu goes to visit Manami`s flower shop. Manami tells Amu that she dreams of being a florist some day. While Amu is leaving, Lulu de Morcerf shows up to see Manami. The next day, Amu brings Manami cookies for thanks when Miki and Su sense a Guardian Egg (Ran doesn`t sense it, but plays along). Amu meets Lulu, and she learns that Lulu can see Guardian Characters. Ikuto sees Lulu walking up the Easter building steps and, after she passes him, stares at her with disdain. Later, Lulu meets Manami again and turns her Heart`s Egg into a Mystery Egg using a special ruby necklace. The Guardian Characters sense this, and the Guardians go to Manami, who Character Transforms into Flower Dream. Amu transforms into Amulet Heart. She almost gets squashed by Manami, but gets powered up pom-poms to deflect her attack. After reasoning with Manami, her Mystery Egg turns into an X Egg, allowing a stronger Open Heart to purify her. At the end, Amu is with the Guardians, wondering if Lulu was connected to Easter and the events.\nSource: crunchyroll",
