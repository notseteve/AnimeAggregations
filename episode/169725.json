  "description" : "In the match against the Genius 10`s No. 2 Tanegashima and No. 6 Omagari, Sanada chooses Akutsu for his partner. The middle schoolers express concern over Akutsu`s break from tennis, but it`s Sanada who can`t handle Tanegashima`s slippery style. Sanada`s wildly swinging racket strikes Akutsu on the cheek! Akutsu rises to his feet amidst a tense atmosphere. However, there`s no rage in his expression... Akutsu can`t afford to lose this match, either. \"Play your own style.\" Receiving Akutsu`s words, Sanada regains his focus.\nSource: crunchyroll",
