  "description" : "The Ghost Detective Club has a new case. The client is a professor that uses Deco overlays to create artificial animal that he has on display at his Neo Animal Museum. His self-proclaimed masterpiece, the Nue, has an appearence that doesn`t match the listing on Decopeedia, and hires the detective club hoping to clear up the confusion. After getting a glimpse at the professor`s Nue, it looks nothing like the cute creature whose picture is on the Decopedia page. Even so, the professor insists that his Nue is the accurate version.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
