  "description" : "Benio has moved into the Seika dormitory, which puts her into conflict with Rokuro after their unpleasant first encounter. Soon a strange individual arrives at the dorm clad only in a pair of underpants. This turns out to be the leader of all exorcists, the Chief Exorcist Tsuchimikado Arima. After inviting the members of the dorm to the Five Mirror Chamber, he asks Rokuro and Benio to battle in front of exorcist authorities from around Japan. Benio wants to test Rokuro`s strength, but he still wants nothing to do with being an exorcist.\nSource: crunchyroll",
