  "description" : "Kitaro arrives with a clip-clop in a lonely village deep in the mountains where Masae lives. The one who called Kitaro is Masae`s only son, Sho, who lives in Tokyo. Sho says that Masae is possessed by yokai, but after Sho willfully flew out of the house, she won`t listen to anything he says. But Masae`s body grows steadily weaker, and if things are left like this, it will soon be a matter of life and death. Will Kitaro be able to get rid of the yokai that clings to Masae...?\nSource: crunchyroll",
