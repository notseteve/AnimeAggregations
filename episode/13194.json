  "description" : "Just when you`d think Shun is sure to be destroyed, someone interferes with ArIes\nconcentration, infiltrating his forbidding mind control powers, and he loses control of his death-grip on Shim, saving him for the time being. That someone is Ikki, the bronze saint Phoenix, who is recovering from wounds sustained during his last battle far away from Greece. Since no one has ever been able to break into his mind before, ArIes is surprised that Ikki was capable of such a feat. But ArIes quickly shrugs it off and returns to trying to destroy Shun, by sending him into another dimension to join his friend Cygnus. But, like Seiya discovered fighting Alderbaran, Shun finds his seventh-sense and shocks saint Gemini (ArIes mind control) with a powerful attack. Shun saves himself, and angers ArIes, or is it ArIes?! After Shun`s desperate attack, another ArIes appears beside the old one? Are there two of them? Are they twins? Stay tuned.\nSource: crunchyroll",
