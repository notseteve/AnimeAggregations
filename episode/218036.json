  "description" : "Lately there has been a string of thefts targeting Azpire`s local specialty - melila fruit. As a result, prices within the city are steadily skyrocketing. Taichi and the others accept a quest to guard the melila orchards, but when the monsters attacking the fields prove to be monsters that don`t live in that region, they begin to suspect that someone else is responsible for setting up the attacks. Shortly thereafter a new threat begins closing in on Rin and Taichi.\nSource: crunchyroll",
