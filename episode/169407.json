  "description" : "Ayame once again gets Tanikuchi to assist her in her terrorist plots, first finding a cache of pornographic magazines, surreptitiously duplicating them and hiding them in various places around the school for students to find. The student council secretary Gouriki distrusts him (despite being the one he saved from accusations of molestation at the train), and he tells them that his father was, like Ayame`s, an activist against the new laws that created the censorship state, and was arrested and imprisoned as a result. He was ostracised for much of his childhood and only Anna, whom he met in kindergarten, showed him any kindness, so ever since he distanced himself from his father`s ideology. This convinces the council of his sincerity.\nThere is an upcoming health examination at the school, and Anna`s mother has a new bill in the wings that will tighten social control still more. Ayame performs another terrorist plot that involves conducting an \"eye exam\" that will make the students read individual letters and explain the actual process of making babies using what is considered obscene language, without tripping off their collars. He is chased by Anna and Gouriki and very narrowly escapes capture, but from a distance a student sees him remove his disguise.",
