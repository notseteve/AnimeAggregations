  "description" : "The SOS Brigade continue filming, though Haruhi is displeased with the battle sequence. Haruhi conjures the idea of the \"Mikuru Beam\" from her blue-contact lens on the left eye. With Haruhi`s powers, the beam turns out to be real and fires dangerous invisible beams. Yuki protects Kyon from the laser shots before tackling Mikuru and removing the contact. While Haruhi changes Mikuru into a bunny girl outfit, the others discuss the situation. After filming for the remainder of the day, Haruhi leaves insisting on a tight filming schedule until the festival, including working on a Sunday. Yuki uses bite-injected nanomachines to counter Haruhi`s effects on Mikuru. The next day, Mikuru shows some unwillingness to resume prompting Haruhi to pick her up. Also, Haruhi adds Taniguchi, Kunikida and Tsuruya to be extras in the film.",
