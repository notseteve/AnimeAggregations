  "description" : "Nomiya tells Miwako that the firm will split into two locations. One will stay in Tokyo, while the other will move to Tottori. Nomiya intentionally wants Mayama to go to the firm in Tottori. At the same time, Asai is still in the hospital and Rika hasn`t been able to find a replacement for him. Hence, Mayama decides to leave the firm and comes back to work with Rika at the Harada Design Office, without much of asking for her permission. Yamada was acknowledged about this two weeks later through Nomiya, resulting in her depression. Later on, Yamada tells the others that four guys, who were childhood friends of hers, proposed to her at a shopping district, but she chose to run away from them. Professor Hanamoto later on explained to Yamada that her situation with Mayama was similar than that of the four guys who proposed to her. Professor Hanamoto tells her that in the case of one loving someone who doesn`t love another, people could just choose either to try or give up. He advises her to tell the four guys her true feelings. When Yamada leaves, Professor Hanamoto`s thoughts reveal a third choice, but he would never say it aloud. \nSource: Wikipedia",
