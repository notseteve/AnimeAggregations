  "description" : "Summer vacation continues, and Haruhi has many activities lined up for the club when she meets with them at a café. It rains and Yuki shares an umbrella with Kyon. Over the next several days Haruhi has them doing batting practice, bowling, and so forth. Kyon continues to be awkward, until the summer festival. He comments to Ryoko that he must seem very indecisive, and she agrees and says that the current Yuki must be wondering why he is keeping his distance. As the festival fireworks start, Kyon decides to take Yuki aside, pulling her along, until he reaches a secluded spot. Yuki can`t hear what he`s saying amid the fireworks, but the other Yuki hears him as he confesses that he would have fallen in love with her too. Haruhi seems to be discontented by what Kyon and Yuki seem to be doing. Kyon, having said what he had to say, begins to treat Yuki normally again.",
