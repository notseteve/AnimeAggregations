  "description" : "Sakura and the rest of us happened to meet Ms. Maki Matsumoto, the owner of a fancy toy store called Twin Bells. Chiharu decided to buy a cute and cuddly toy, but not long after she got it home, it went missing! As it turned out, there was a rumor going around that whenever someone brought something from Twin Bells, whatever they bought would go missing not long after. Thanks to that rumor, business wasn`t going so great for Ms. Maki. How sad... but Sakura, Kero and I decided to go investigate the store. And lurking among the cuddly toys, we uncovered the Jump card! After a very cinematic struggle, Sakura managed to seal the card away again, and the next day, Twin Bells found itself overflowing with new customers.\nSource: crunchyroll",
