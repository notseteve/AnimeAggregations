  "description" : "Umaru welcomes her brother home as if he were coming into a store or restaurant. When he asks why, she says that this is a parallel world. In this world there are three versions of Umaru, one of which is Umaru as she appears in Sankaku Head`s original two-part short manga. Umaru`s duplicates pester Taihei for comics, money, and soda. Taihei remembers that main characters from parallel worlds usually fight until one is left alive, but the Umarus already playing games. He comments that \"even in a parallel world, himouto is still himouto\".\nSource: ANN",
