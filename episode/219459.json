  "description" : "While giving the gravely wounded Lord El-Melloi II an arduous treatment, Gray and the others harbor doubts about an existence of a Servant whose Master is nowhere to be seen. Shishigou and Luvia are continuing their investigation in London where they visit Jean-Mario Supinerra and inquire about a serial murder that took place seven years ago. The respite was momentary as the course of the Rail Zeppelin has been altered, and the train plunges into the Forest of Dead Apostles, the Child of Einnashe. Gray, worried about the weakened Lord El-Melloi, decides to assist Karabo`s group that is acting to resume the train`s progress. Furthermore, Melvin, who has arrived at the Mystic Eyes Collection Train after hearing of rumors, joins the entourage. Olga Marie, barricading her lonely self after refusing to help Gray, finds a \"certain something\" in her own room.\nSource: crunchyroll",
