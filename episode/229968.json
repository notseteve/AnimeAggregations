  "description" : "\"One last thing, I`m glad I got to meet you.\" Without being able to understand Sasha`s true intent behind these final words, much time has passed, and Ivis, one of the Seven Elder Demon Emperors, holds a special class at the Demon King Academy called the Great Magic Training. The Seven Elder Demon Emperors are seven demons that Anos, the founding ancestor, created from his own blood. Emilia implores Anos to act respectfully to Ivis, but without hesitation, he speaks to Ivis in a condescending tone.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
