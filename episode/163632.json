  "description" : "After working with the Literature Club members to make a personalized video game for July`s birthday, Takanashi Sayumi, who has the power to revert things to their original state, catches a cold. July pays Sayumi a visit at her house, where he meets her younger sister Maiya, though Sayumi attitude suddenly changes when July bring up how she was the student council in middle school. The next day, after July hears from Maiya about how Sayumi had originally wanted to join the student council during high school, Mirei theorizes she may have turned it down due to her powers. This leads July to recall an incident that happened ten months ago in which Sayumi, who suggested they use her \"Root of Origin\" ability to remove everyone`s powers, battled against July who was against it. The result of that battle showed that Sayumi`s power could not erase July`s Dark and Dark, as their powers were meant to be accepted as part of themselves. Sayumi later explains that her change in attitude was purely due to her medication, also stating she has no regrets turning down the student council for the sake of her fellow club members. \nSource: Wikipedia",
