  "description" : "Sukeroku`s parents are killed and the village is burned in a surprise attack by Tahomaru`s army. Sukeroku and Dororo are taken to Banmon with their companions to be crucified there. Sukeroku is shot dead with several arrows. Then it is Dororo`s turn, but Hyakkimaru saves her in the nick of time. Seeing Hyakkimaru save the enemy, Tanomaru tries to slay him, only to be killed by Hyakkimaru instead. Watching all this, the fox goblin of Kuo laughs scornfully, \"You have just killed your own brother.\" Now Kagemitsu, who is raging about his son`s death, begins to pursue Hyakkimaru. He finally loses hope to live as a man, for he has killed his brother, has turned from his mother, and has made his father pursue him. He is driven to so much despair that he closes his heart even to Dororo...\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
