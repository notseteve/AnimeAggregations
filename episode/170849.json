  "description" : "Renge goes to visit Natsumi, but she and her family aren`t home. She`s about to give up and leave when a hand starts talking to her from the other side of the fence! She thinks it`s a monster, and is relieved to learn that it`s the next door neighbor Konomi. But Konomi then tells her that she is, in fact, a monster... Later, the Koshigaya sisters tell Renge they were in first grade when they took off their training wheels, so Renge starts to practice riding her bike without the training wheels.\nSource: crunchyroll",
