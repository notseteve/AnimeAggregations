  "description" : "Warrior of the Dog, Dotsuku, is known for his powerful bite, \"Mad Dog`s Vise.\" However, he has a secret skill: the ability to create and secrete a variety of poisons from his body. This provides Dotsuku an advantage in a contest where all the participants have been poisoned to enforce a time limit. His plan is to let the other warriors kill each other, and wait while they thin out their own numbers... but his plan is interrupted by a certain under-the-radar warrior.\nSource: crunchyroll",
