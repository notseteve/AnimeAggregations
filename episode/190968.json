  "description" : "Vampires. That is the true form of Hideyoshi. Shinga is a world where non-human tribes of vampires and werewolves live. By chance it is discovered that Yuzuki blood has the ability to awaken the latent powers of Gegga Tribe members, much like the mysterious Himemiko who has vanished. While the ability of her blood makes Yuzuki valuable in a battle, it also has the potential to become a reason why she might become a target. Hideyoshi tells Yuzuki that he will protect her, but she has to marry him first.\nSource: crunchyroll",
