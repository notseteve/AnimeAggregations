  "description" : "A terrified Pidove flees at rapid speed, crashing into Chloe’s window with a thud! Then, to Chloe and her family’s surprise, Yamper drags the injured Pidove inside! The Cerise family wants to help the Pokémon recover, but Yamper becomes jealous of the attention Pidove receives, especially from Chloe. Meanwhile, Pidove is content to stay perched on Yamper’s back—which annoys Yamper even more! But when a menacing Fearow attacks, Chloe draws upon her bond with Yamper to defeat it in battle. Soon after that, Pidove’s Trainer arrives to take his beloved Pokémon home. The Cerise family will never forget Pidove…and Chloe’s appreciation for Pokémon has grown just a bit more!\nSource: Official Website",
