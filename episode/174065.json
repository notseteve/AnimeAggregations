  "description" : "Kogane`s enraged cry of \"I`ll gouge out your everything!\" rings out as she engages Matobai in battle, but her opponent`s attack power overwhelms her. When Azuma tries to help her, Matobai mercilessly fires his Bubuki gun at him, but the heart Bubuki shields him. Azuma tries to use the heart to call Oubu to fight, but it doesn`t respond... and Matobai sneers at their confusion as he takes out Entei`s heart Bubuki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
