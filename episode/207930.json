  "description" : "The slime Mikami and the Storm Dragon Veldora decide to give each other names. Veldora gives the slime Mikami the name \"Rimuru,\" and Rimuru comes up with a family name for both of them: \"Tempest.\" Then Rimuru uses his Predator skill to take Veldora into his body and analyze the \"Unlimited Imprisonment\" seal in hopes of breaking it... but this action sends a shock through the nations surrounding the Great Forest of Jura. With Veldora gone, there`s a chance that the larger nations could become bold and invade the smaller provinces. With no knowledge of this, Rimuru leaves the cave and meets some Goblins.\nSource: crunchyroll",
