  "description" : "With a singular goal in mind, Midge and the bugs, along with the frogs, work together to take down an antenna on Mars that allows all the robots in the universe to charge remotely. With the help of their new allies, the cockroaches, who once lived on Mars and were the first to try and resist them, they work together to take down the antenna`s strict security. Once through, they come face to face with the Great Consultant, an artificial intelligence put in place by the humans to make the critical decisions in the terraforming process. From the AI they find out the final missing pieces behind the fate of the all living things in the universe. Midge and the others flee Mars when the technology supporting the artificial atmosphere begins to fail. They make one last desperate effort to reach Earth, unsure of what they might find.\nSource: crunchyroll",
