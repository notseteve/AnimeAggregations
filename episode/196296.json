  "description" : "Yuzu promises Nina that she`ll support Sara`s love with her, but after learning that the girl of Sara`s destiny is Mei, she can`t help but feel shaken.  Nina ignores all the attention she`s drawing, desperately holding Yuzu back to keep her from going to Mei. During their conflict Yuzu gets a call from Sara on her smartphone, saying \"There`s something I need to give you.\" She quickly races to the overlook, but Mei isn`t there, only Sara greeting her with a slightly sad smile as she returns the student ID Yuzu dropped earlier.\nSource: crunchyroll",
