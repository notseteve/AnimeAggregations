  "description" : "We started a new term at school recently, Sakura and I are finally in the fifth grade! When Sakura met Yukito on the way to school, he gave her a birthday present- he`s so smooth! We all got to stay in the same class, but we had a new teacher who turned out to be Ms. Mizuki. Sakura was super excited about it; I think she really likes Ms. Mizuki. It started snowing a lot though, which was strange for spring. It snowed so much that the whole town was almost covered! Of course, Sakura realized it was the Snow card and went to capture it, btu she got caught in a snowy cyclone and lost the new watch Yukito had given gave her. She got really upset and used Firey to burn up all the snow. Luckily, Ms. Mizuki found the watch and returned it to Sakura!\nSource: crunchyroll",
