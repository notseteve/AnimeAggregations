  "description" : "Deciding Yuki needs a familiar for her role, Haruhi picks up a stray cat and names it Shamisen. However, when Haruhi leaves that day, Shamisen starts talking as a result of Haruhi`s powers. The other Brigade members meet up, where Itsuki suggests a reminder to Haruhi that her movie is a work of fiction, before reality incurs further damage. Later on, both Mikuru and Yuki share their independent views about Haruhi. As Haruhi`s powers continue through filming, Itsuki calls out Kyon to hold back Haruhi`s powers. Kyon accomplishes this by convincing Haruhi to add a disclaimer over the credits saying it is a work of fiction. After the filming, Kyon and Haruhi remain at the club room to do the editing. Kyon falls asleep while editing the movie, but wakes up the next day to find the movie had somehow completed itself while he was sleeping. The episode ends with a flashback to May, where Kyon tells Haruhi the truth about the other Brigade members, but she does not believe him.",
