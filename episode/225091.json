  "description" : "Ash and Goh head to Ecruteak City in Johto to investigate rumors of a Ho-Oh sighting, and when they arrive, they see something that looks like Ho-Oh flying in the sky! But it’s actually an imitation created by a boy named Chad, whose grandfather Jaye has been unsuccessfully searching for the Legendary Pokémon for years. Jaye has become convinced that Ho-Oh isn’t real, but Ash knows otherwise. Our heroes accompany Chad and Jaye to the top of Bell Tower, where they call out for Ho-Oh. Nothing happens, but just as Ash, Goh, and Chad start to leave, Jaye takes one last look toward the sky…and finally sees Ho-Oh for himself!\nSource: Official Website",
