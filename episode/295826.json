  "description" : "\"Astro Boy the Movie: Hero of Space\" is a reconstructed film version of episodes 46, 56, and 71 from the \"Astro Boy\" TV series, with some scenes from episodes 1, 2, and 3 added.\nThe opening, the transitions between episodes, and the beginning and middle of episode 46 are all newly drawn, new scenes have been added for the theatrical release, and new audio has also been recorded.\nAdditionally, episode 56 was produced entirely in color, while episode 71 was produced partially in color, but because the series was broadcast in black and white on television, the vivid colors were shown on the big screen for the first time at the time.\nThis time, the black and white parts were colored using the latest technology, based on the partially colored parts. The original manga colors were used as a reference for the parts that were not colored, and all scenes were given vivid colors. This will be the first time it is shown on TV as a nostalgic yet new work based on the colors of the time.",
