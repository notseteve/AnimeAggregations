  "description" : "Tsuna has defeated Mukuro—or has he? It turns out that Mukuro is really Lancia, one of Mukuro’s associates. With an injured Yamamoto still unconscious, Tsuna and the rest of the gang charge into the building where Mukuro is. Standing in their way is Chikusa, and Gokudera insists on fighting him while Tsuna and the rest move on. When Ken barges in, Gokudera is injured and tumbles into the basement, where Hibari is being held! Meanwhile, Tsuna and the rest face off against the real Mukuro.\nSource: crunchyroll",
