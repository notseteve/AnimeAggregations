  "description" : "The world ended on February 29th. In the ruins of Tokyo, gravely wounded Cat-girl and Daddy Eyeball are surrounded by people who have turned into vampires. \"This is the end, Cat-girl...\" Looming over her, a vampiric Kitaro and Mana. Though the people dearest to her are right in front of her, there`s nothing Cat-girl can do. Daddy Eyeball steels his will and summons the Phantom Train. It`s a train that can only be called once, at the cost of Daddy Eyeball`s life. As Cat-girl jumps aboard, Daddy Eyeball says, \"Save the world... Save Kitaro, please...\" and then he`s engulfed by flames. Where will the Phantom Train take Cat-girl...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
