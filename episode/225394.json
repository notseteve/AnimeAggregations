  "description" : "For some reason, the glasses case Himuro gives Yukimura as a present is smashed to pieces. Shock sends Himuro racing away from the scene. Ibarada points out that it could have broken when Himuro fell on the stairs, but Yukimura estimates the force of impact based on the case`s mass, materials, and height of fall, and concludes that someone must have deliberately destroyed it. Finally, at dawn, Yukimura finds Himuro crouched alone, barefooted, on a bridge. Will they be able to reconcile? And will they be able to prove their love...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
