  "description" : "Still unable to get permission to perform in Opening Ceremony and now facing the prospect that they will be excluded from the Ayanagi Festival all together, Hoshitani and the others try to at least get their class performance time slot back. However, through their exchanges with Irinatsu and Kasugano, positive feelings for wanting to be acknowledged by the Kao Council have begun to emerge in the group.
