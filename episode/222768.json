Since Iruma is human, he can’t fly, so he’s riding on the back of the giant baby demon bird, but it seems to be flying off course. Meanwhile, Sabnock decides to go through the treacherous Cutthroat Valley and ends up having to battle it out with the Guardian there. Sabnock is obsessed with becoming the next Demon King, but why is he so obsessed? Are Iruma and Sabnock going to be able to make it out of Cutthroat Valley alive?\nSource: crunchyroll",
