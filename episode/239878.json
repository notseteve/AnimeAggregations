  "description" : "Emden`s Decapitator is a literal killer technique. Cestvs` muddy consciousness recalls the single knockout blow his master Zafar taught him. Furthermore, Emden has been injured by Cestvs` attacks so far. He could win by trading blows... But in the next moment, Emden`s fist cuts Cestvs` brow, which begins bleeding into his eye. It`s kill or be killed. While one of Cestvs` eyes is blinded, Emden attempts to finish him off.\nSource: crunchyroll",
