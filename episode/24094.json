  "description" : "Burning with the desire to know his destiny, Triton heads for the Atlantic Ocean by himself despite Ruka`s warning. In the Atlantic Ocean, the Poseidon family that rules the sea is waiting for Triton. Triton is caught in their trap, and ends up in the sea graveyard fighting against one of the leaders of the family, Doriate, who is also the commander of the North Pacific Ocean. Triton has a hard fight because it is his first real battle, but Medon sacrifices his life for Triton to win. The Poseidon Family had killed the Triton Family, but there might be some survivors. Triton and Ruka head for the North Sea to look for his fellows.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
