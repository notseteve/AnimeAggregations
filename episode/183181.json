He follows her eyes and sees that she seems to be looking at their good-looking classmate, Mikasa. After school, Yuu ends up on pool-cleaning duty with Fuuka and Mikasa, but he can`t stop wondering about their relationship. Meanwhile, Koyuki Hinashi, a childhood friend that Yuu lost contact with after she became a popular singer, finally calls Yuu for the first time in years.\nSource: crunchyroll",
