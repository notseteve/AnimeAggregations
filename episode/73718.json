  "description" : "Mutsu`s Pleasure Support Club tries to deliver batteries so powerful that one can power a space battleship to Aoki and Co. But a group of men dressed in black shows up and steals the batteries and the money. Mutsu asks the Odd Jobs to recover the batteries and the money and capture the Pleasure Support Club’s missing leader, Sakamoto. Gintoki and the others easily capture Sakamoto and go to Aoki and Co., but find no clues. Gintoki and the others are forced to go along with Sakamoto`s plan to go out gallivanting and drinking. As they totter down the night road, heading home, a group sneaks up behind them. Gintoki and Sakamoto realize the danger they`re in and reminisce about the past as they confront their attackers. Sakamoto fires a gun and bluffs the enemy into retreating so no one gets hurt.\nSource: crunchyroll",
