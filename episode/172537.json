  "description" : "Goku and Vegeta continue their training under Whis on Beerus` planet. Meanwhile, Sorbet and his assistant Tagoma depart their ship and head for Earth in order to find the Dragon Balls, with which they intend to resurrect their leader Freeza. They run into the Pilaf Gang who had collected all seven Dragon Balls just before their arrival. Sorbet coerces Pilaf into summoning Shenlong. At first, Shenlong refuses to revive Freeza, seeing it as pointless given his current state – cut in pieces, just as he was when Future Trunks killed him. Tagoma suggests using their advanced healing technology to make Freeza intact again. Sorbet has Freeza resurrected, and they return to their ship. Freeza is completely renewed shortly afterwards.\nSource: Wikipedia",
