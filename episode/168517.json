  "description" : "Kurusu Kimihito has found himself host to a beautiful lamia named Miia under the Cultural Exchange Between Species Act. She has taken quite a liking to him, despite the prohibition against interspecies breeding in the law. Life with her is rough in more ways than one, as she many times inadvertently strangles or knocks him about, and she constantly tries to seduce him, which would be prohibited by law. There is still a lot of prejudice against monsters in the human population. One day, as they go out into town, a pair of bigots insults Kimihito for his hosting a monster like Miia, which angers her, and she tries to attack them, but is stopped by Kimihito, who receives the blow instead. This attracts the attention of a crowd, and so the two are chased into a love hotel, where they are stopped from having a sexual liaison by Ms. Smith, the government official overseeing them. As they leave they see the same pair of bigots again, who this time insult Miia, which leads Kimihito to punch them.",
