  "description" : "A year passes and Kakeru and Nana are now students in Enoshima High school. They enroll in a soccer club, discovering that their club is the school`s unofficial soccer team dubbed FC. They learn that before nationals tournament, FC competes with the official soccer team, dubbed SC, to determine who represents the school. Kakeru and Nana remain on the team after realizing FC`s unconventional training is more effective than SC`s. Meanwhile, Kakeur attempts to persuade Ryuichi to rejoin FC, who quit soccer after losing to SC. Ryuichi explains the same frustration he felt as Suguru about the lack of skilled forwards to accept his passes but is inspired by Kakeru who offers to accept that position.\nSource: Wikipedia",
