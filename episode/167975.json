  "description" : "Makina gets Kagami to visit certain truant students in his class and convince them to go back to attending school, but as expected, he dodges this duty and goes to Akihabara to buy a new manga. He meets a girl in a Gothic Lolita outfit, whom he later learns is Tenjouin Kisaki, the author of his favourite manga. Makina is insistent and emails him a photo of one of the truant students named Tanaka Sachiko, and it turns out that she is also Tenjouin Kisaki herself.\nKagami gets Kisaki to attend school long enough to irritate Makina enough that she`ll feel that Kisaki is too much trouble. Kisaki thus follows Makina around, saying that she needs to observe her as a character reference for a new manga about a student council president she is writing, and she observes her everywhere, including in the toilet and even following her home, but even this fails to really faze Makina. Eventually it is seen that she used to be friends with Kisaki until she dropped out to concentrate on her manga work. Makina displays an otaku-like dedication to getting people to attend school which impresses Kisaki so she decides to go back.",
