  "description" : "Yuki completes her explanation of the Integrated Data Entity and how it relates to herself and to Haruhi. Furthermore, she discusses Haruhi`s powers, and how she could destroy and recreate the world on a whim. Kyon, while simply trying to understand all of what Yuki had told him, is initially skeptical of her story. The SOS Brigade gets a new member — a mysterious transfer student by the name of Itsuki Koizumi. On a day off from school, the SOS Brigade searches the city in groups to try to investigate mysteries, during which Mikuru reveals to Kyon the existence of time-travelers. Kyon later confronts Itsuki, revealed to be an esper, and learns of the Agency.",
