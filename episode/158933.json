When his senpais decide to throw a party for the ailing master of Raijin stable, Matsutaro is not invited; though Tanaka is invited, he decides to stay with the rejected outcast, not because he feels sorry for him, but because his master told him to keep Matsutaro out of trouble.\nSource: crunchyroll",
