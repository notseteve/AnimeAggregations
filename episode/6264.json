  "description" : "Having survived his weird trip to the Real World, Takuya returned to the Digital World on a mission. He realized that being a Digimon may be fun but it isn`t a game, it’s serious. As was the trouble that J.P., Zoe and Tommy were in, they were being tickle-tortured by Mercurymon & Ranamon. Then, out of nowhere, Lobomon appeared to try and save them but he was still too weak from the battle with Duskmon. When it seemed like it was all over, a new and more powerful Agunimon arrived with the power of nature as his ally. He saved his friends and sent the bad guys packing.\nSource: crunchyroll",
