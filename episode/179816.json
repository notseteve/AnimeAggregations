  "description" : "\"I love seeing guys get along more than anything!\" Serinuma Kae is a second year high school student who`s always entertaining such wild thoughts and pairing boys up everywhere. Everyday, she enjoys discussing her fujoshi flavored fantasies with her like-minded friend, A-chan. But one day, Kae`s favorite anime character dies, and she suddenly loses a lot of weight in shock. She becomes a head turning beauty, and because of that, gets asked out on a date by four hot guys from her school.\nSource: crunchyroll",
