  "description" : "As far as Shinnosuke is concerned, Yotaro is his beloved father, and now that he`s become a popular storyteller, Yotaro is even appearing on TV shows. After he performs \"Jugemu\" on a children`s program, all the kids begin reciting it. Meanwhile, he`s also getting steady work at the theater, while Konatsu plays shamisen in the wings. Higuchi is overjoyed to see it to see Yotaro satisfy so many people, but his desire to create new rakugo works hasn`t changed. That`s when he decides to entreat Yakumo for aid.\nSource: crunchyroll",
