  "description" : "Just before Lawrence departs, the shepherd, Nora, asks him if he would hire her as an escort to protect the party from wolves. After a conversation with Holo, Lawrence does so and the group heads off towards Rubenhaigen. Upon arrival, Lawrence parts ways with Nora to sell the armor in his cart. As Lawrence passes the initial inspection and pays the tax for the two armor sets, he finds the city government reluctant to receive armor as payment. Lawrence and Holo head to the guild of which he is a member and are greeted warmly inside.\nSource: Wikipedia",
