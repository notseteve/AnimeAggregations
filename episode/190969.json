  "description" : "One day, Yuzuki is enveloped by a mysterious light and taken to an unfamiliar world. It is a world like that of the Sengoku Period, where warlords are fighting for domination. In the midst of the chaos, Yuzuki encounters a warlord named Hideyoshi Toyotomi. Hideyoshi commands the Toyotomi Army, and, along with his retainers, Hanbee Takenaka, Kanbee Kuroda, Toshiie Maeda, and Mitsunari Ishida, fights for the unification of this world at war. This world is known as Shinga, where non-human Gegga Tribes fight against one another.\nSource: crunchyroll",
