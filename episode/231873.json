  "description" : "Julius orders the Black Bulls to save Nero and Marie, so Captain Yami, Noelle, Finral, Gordon and Gauche travel to a certain town along with the captain of the Silver Eagles Nozel, to see if they can find any clues. They try to ask the townspeople for some clues, but it appears that they are less than willing to cooperate because they seem to hold a grudge against the Magic Knights who weren’t able to come to their immediate aid after they were attacked by the elves.\nSource: crunchyroll",
