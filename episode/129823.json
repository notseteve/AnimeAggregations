  "description" : "Rintaro discovers that a CRT television in the electronics shop below the lab has been serving as the \"lifter\" from the PhoneWave, as the D-Mails can only be sent when it is turned on. Kurisu then theorizes that it might be possible to send frontal lobe memories back in time through the PhoneWave, allowing the consciousness of a person to \"time leap\" into the past. As Rintaro goes into town with Mayuri to look for parts Kurisu needs, he explains to her that a time leap may be safer to conduct than simply sending D-Mails due to the nature of chaos theory, as the D-Mails can produce unexpected consequences once sent. They run into Moeka along the way, as well as Suzuha, who tells Rintaro that Kurisu allegedly works for SERN. As Kurisu denies this, she tells Rintaro about the problems she has with her father, who grew to hate her because she surpassed him in scientific prowess. Later on when out shopping, Okabe receives another threatening text message with a picture of a severed doll`s head attached, causing him to return to the lab, fearing for Mayuri`s safety. Later, Daru informs the group that the lab has been connected to the SERN network without them knowing. \nSource: Wikipedia",
