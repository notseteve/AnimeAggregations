  "description" : "The battle between Ryuuji and Rikuo begins. Ryuji uses his ultimate weapon, and challenges Rikuo that if he manages to survive in three minutes, there might be a chance that Rikuo might win. Rikuo manages to survive but he is severely injured. Believing that Rikuo can`t move as fast as before, Ryuji attacks him but he gets tricked by Rikuo, who slashes him. Mamiru suddenly attacks in order to protect Ryuji, but Rikuo`s trusted comrades appear to protect their master. Surprisingly, Ryuuji gets up and asks himself why he isn`t wounded. He realizes that Rikuo uses a sword that only slices a youkai. He decides to leave the battle between them and told Yura why he was there. After the battle, Yura asks Rikuo whether he is a human or not. He replies that he is a human by day and a yokai by night but still the same Nura, even if he does seem different.",
