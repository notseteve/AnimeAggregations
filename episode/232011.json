  "description" : "Glenn begins preparing for the surgery to get rid of the tumor on Skadi’s heart. Because Skadi is a dragon, Glenn goes to the Kuklo Workshop where many of the cyclops blacksmiths work to get special tools made for her surgery. The suture needles need to be strong and mass produced, and their apprentice Memé is put in charge of getting them made because of how skilled she is. Memé is usually rather hard on herself, but she wants to do everything she can to help Skadi out, so she does her absolute best. But because she overworks herself, she ends up passing out.\nSource: crunchyroll",
