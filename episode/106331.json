  "description" : "One morning, Miss Marimo told the story of “The first bad employee at Fushin” to the girls. However, for some reason, Saki was in a bad mood during this time. Finally, she got up and went to her room. Kana was concerned for her so she asked one of the girls what happened and they all seemed to know. It seemed to be related to an incident that happened a year before Kana arrived during the wintertime.\nSource: crunchyroll",
