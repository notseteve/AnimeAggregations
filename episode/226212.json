  "description" : "Mazama Jin here. Seton Academy has a campus by the sea. Just try to picture it: blue sea, white clouds... and the one you care about most by your side. In my case, of course, that`s Hitomi-chan. And in Hitomi-chan`s case, it`s me. I think. Look! The sea creatures are giving us their blessing with a beautiful performance! Maybe I could have immersed myself in that feeling... if the ones performing weren`t a stupid beluga whale and a stupid bottlenose dolphin.\nSource: crunchyroll",
