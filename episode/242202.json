  "description" : "The Nine Schools Competition begins, and Shizuku goes head-to-head with Shiori in the Speed Shooting tournament. Shiori utilizes the “Arithmetic Chain” magic sequence which allows her to perform mathematical calculations faster than a supercomputer. Shiori left her own broken family to join Airi’s team, and her determination to win drives Shizuku into a corner. Honoka and her friends nervously watch the match, but Miyuki says, “Who do you think Shizuku’s engineer is?” with a confident smile. Just as she has predicted, Tatsuya has a secret tactic up his sleeve to bring victory to Shizuku.\nSource: Funimation",
