  "description" : "Chrome and Tsuna are the only ones left to take their inheritance succession tests. But Tsuna hears from Kyoko and Haru that Chrome is nowhere to be found. Worried, Tsuna and his friends make their way to Kokuyo Land to see what is going on. The gang runs into Ken and Chikusa along the way, who say that Chrome is back but acting strange. They rush over to Chrome, who bursts into tears and says she doesn’t want to fight anymore. Tsuna feels bad for having dragged her into some tough situations, but he doesn’t quite know what to say to her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
