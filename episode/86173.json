  "description" : "A tremendous number of Mister Ts appear and surround Juudai. Juudai is left with nowhere to run. Suddenly a figure appears... it`s Saiou. He has important information to relay to Juudai, who has escaped from Mister T - Mister T`s target is Duel Academy. However, Saiou can`t let Juudai go to the academy, so he challenges him to a Duel. Juudai has no choice but to accept. Saiou uses a combo of The Fool and Tour of the Dead cornering Juudai by rendering him unable to summon monsters.\nSource: crunchyroll",
