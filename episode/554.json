  "description" : "Yoshihiko spends his time in the arcade instead of practicing, much to the annoyance of his baseball coach. Brought back to the sports field by the assistant coach, Yoshihiko suddenly faces a challenge by his exact counterpart, female team manager Horikawa who prefers baseball practice over a third meal every day. It`s just that no one had the guts so far to tell Horikawa that the finals at the Koushien stadium will be nothing but a dream for her as female players aren`t allowed in the league.",
