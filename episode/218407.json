  "description" : "Kitaro and the others celebrate the fishing festival with everyone from Sakaiminato. Then, Mana hears a strange voice calling her and disappears. At the same time, the door to the hidden village of Yumigahama opens. The voice calling to Mana leads her across a bridge and through that door. When she regains her senses, Mana is in a place overgrown with beautiful flowers. There, she meets children dressed in Japanese clothes. The boy who leads them, Ichinoshin, tells her she can`t return from that place. He also tells her that they are from the second year of Bunsei, which means they`re children from the Edo era. Will Kitaro and the others be able to find Mana? And what about the children...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
