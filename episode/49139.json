  "description" : "The Christmas season is just getting started, and Sayoko is anything but merry. She`s complaining of an \"empty\" feeling that consumes her. Unable to think of any other reason for her feeling, she blames Keiichi for it since he is the only man at the university who does not vie for her attention. She concludes that in order to fill the void in her heart, she must win Keiichi`s affection. Meanwhile, Urd hints to Belldandy that humans are easily affected by the cold weather and that Keiichi runs the risk of becoming ill. Belldandy knits all of her emotions and memories into a very special sweater for Keiichi. After Keiichi finds Sayoko drunk on the side of the road, Belldandy is accidentally sent on a search to find Keiichi`s sweater, Keiichi on a date with Sayoko, and Sayoko is forced to learn a lesson about feelings.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
