  "description" : "While on their way back to Resembool to have Edward`s automail arm repaired, the Elric brothers buy earrings as souvenirs for Winry to prevent her from getting mad about the broken automail. Later on, Edward fights an assassin and his automail gets broken again, and he buys more earrings for Winry to avoid her wrath. Winry explains that she decided to pierce her ears after meeting Hawkeye on the day Edward decided to become a state alchemist. Meanwhile, Hawkeye explains to Rebecca that she grew her hair long after meeting Winry that same day. Rebecca comments on how simple a reason that is, and Hawkeye says that reasons are always simple. To explain her choice, she remarks that they are all living in a simple world, one where when they pull the trigger and their enemies die.",
