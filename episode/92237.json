  "description" : "Kotoko is still learning the tricks and trades of becoming a nurse. Kotoko faints during an practice autopsy which results in Keita saving her. Naoki sees this and decides to confront Keita. Keita however strongly believes that Naoki treats Kotoko with no respect and ignores Naoki`s words. Meanwhile Naoki`s mother seems to notice that Keita is much more chivalrous to Kotoko than Naoki and decides to find out more about him. After gaining information from other students, Keita is just a nice guy and even Naoki`s mother believes that even she would choose Keita over Naoki. The end of the episode shows Keita concerned about Kotoko going back to Naoki, and asking her to leave Naoki for her own good, as he believes Naoki does not love her.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
