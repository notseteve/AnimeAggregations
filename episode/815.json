Haru runs and jumps onto Garein and aims for the Shadow Stone engraved in Lance`s sword, thereby destroying it. Haru defeats Lance afterward by knocking the sword out of his hands. Lance surrenders, begging for his life to be spared. However, he attempts to kill Haru, but to no avail. Haru then decides to destroy Lance`s sword. The Shadow Guard attempts to attack, but they are stopped by Musica. Then the Imperial Guards infiltrate Lance`s headquarters, only to find the Shadow Guard defeated.\nSource: wiki",
