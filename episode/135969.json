  "description" : "Muginami transfers into Madoka`s class, which causes worry for the organisation. Later, Youko and one of the organization`s representatives talk to Madoka`s teacher about her piloting Midori. Youko agrees to let Madoka continue piloting Midori on the condition that she is allowed to continue living at home and attending school. Soon afterwards, Madoka and Muginami participate in an open swimming contest whilst Lan keeps watch on a boat. Spotting her, Muginami decides to play a prank on Lan and tip her into the sea, unaware that she is unable to swim. Realising her mistake, Muginami helps Madoka rescue Lan and performs CPR on her. Afterwards, Madoka invites Muginami to join the Jersey Club, much to Lan`s annoyance. Both Muginami and Lan decide to help out at Madoka`s family restaurant, with their individual traits attracting many customers. After becoming jealous after Madoka allows Muginami to live with her, Lan also decides to transfer into Madoka`s class, join the Jersey Club and start living with Madoka. Meanwhile, a glitch in security allows Array to escape imprisonment and rejoin his allies, who are making a deal with another enemy.\nSource: Wikipedia",
