  "description" : "Ragyo uses Shinra-Koketsu`s powers to negate the effects of everyone else`s Life Fibers. She then revives the original Life Fiber to fuse everyone with it, but Senketsu, who is immune to Ragyo`s ability, manages to knock Rei out of Koketsu and restore everyone`s power. This allows the Elite Four and Nudist Beach to destroy the satellite uplink while Ryuko and Satsuki deal a critical blow to Ragyo. However, Nui fuses herself with the original Life Fiber and combines with Ragyo, enabling her to launch into space where she activates the satellite manually, covering the world in a Life Fiber coccoon. Ryuko absorbs her allies` Goku Uniforms to form Senketsu-Kisaragi and battle Ragyo, taking her attacks to provide Senketsu with the power needed to absorb Shinra-Koketsu and finally eliminate all of the Life Fibers. Refusing to surrender, Ragyo kills herself by ripping out and destroying her own heart. Senketsu uses the last of his strength to return Ryuko safely to Earth, where she reunites with her friends and family. With the world now free to wear whatever clothes they want, Ryuko begins a new life with Mako and Satsuki.",
