While escaping into the woods, Yuzuki is injured and loses consciousness but is found by Kenshin Uesugi and taken back to his castle to receive treatment. Kenshin entrusts Yuzuki`s care to his son, Kagekatsu but when her injury worsens Kagekatsu feels extremely responsible. It is during this time that information comes to light that the neighboring country is making suspicious movements so Kenshin decides to send a commander with reinforcements. He tries to task Kagekatsu with this mission, but having lost confidence in himself, Kagekatsu refuses and Yuzuki tries to get father and son to see eye-to-eye.\nSource: crunchyroll",
