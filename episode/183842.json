  "description" : "Fifth Force occasionally has a round-robin tournament in order to improve their combat capabilities. It`s Altair Torte`s first time participating in the tournament, and with their difference in experience clear, they quickly lose the first match. After the match, the members talk about the reason they lost, and come to the conclusion that they have to use novel tactics to make up for their lack of experience. Yuumi helps come up with a plan, but will their sneak attack succeed...?\nSource: crunchyroll",
