  "description" : "Tsumugi wants to throw a party: a gyoza party!  And a party means that she can invite all her friends, everyone she knows at daycare, and Kotori, and Shinobu, and even Yagi!  But she`s just a little girl, and doesn`t know that you have to get permission from Kotori`s mom before you can hold a party at Kotori`s house.  How can Kouhei resolve this sticky situation? And what`s the best way to make gyoza, anyway?\nSource: crunchyroll",
