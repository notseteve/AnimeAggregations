  "description" : "Gokuu gathers the Dragon Balls together and summons Shenron who is startled by Beerus` presence. Shenron quickly explains that the Super Saiyan God is not a person but a legendary transformation that only kindhearted Saiyans can achieve by fusing their power together. The Saiyans attempt to transform Gokuu but fail, as they are one Saiyan short. Growing tired of waiting, Beerus starts preparing his attack to destroy the planet. Suddenly, Videl jumps in front of the Saiyans. She says that there is one more Saiyan who might be able to help them – her and Gohan`s unborn child. The Saiyans and Videl attempt the transformation again and manage to transform Gokuu into the Super Saiyan God.\nSource: Wikipedia",
