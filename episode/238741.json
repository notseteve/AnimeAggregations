Inside the snake Zo Zo meets up with Keith, also a snake snack, and together they devise a hot-sauce escape!\nIsamu and Zo Zo call in Angel Zombie to help them with Uncle Zombo’s chores, but she is wise and calls in her own back-up team: the Payback Zombies, who teach them a lesson about laziness. Isamu and Zo Zo make friends with Bellow the Cloud, who shows them the ability to change shapes and transform water into rain or snow. Isamu has the bright idea to feed him donuts, in hopes that Bellow will rain donuts all over the land. Following a grocery shop, Uncle Zombo’s favorite hot sauce is stolen by the Lake Monster, who, as a water-based monster soon realizes he probably shouldn’t have left to see what the fuss was all about!\nSource: crunchyroll",
