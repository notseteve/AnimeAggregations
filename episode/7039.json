  "description" : "Suzu runs into a Shusei group she used to travel with in So Kingdom, and meets another Kai-Kyaku, Asano.  But he refuses Suzu’s offer to travel to Kei with her.  Suzu also saves a boy from falling off a ship, but he tells her he doesn’t like her, nor feels sorry for her Kai-Kyaku background.  Yoko goes to live with the people at a Rike to find out the ordinary people’s needs.  When she protects them from a monster’s attack, she sees Rangyoku struggle to save her brother, and wishes she had someone to care about, too.  Shokei cannot take working as a servant in the palace, so she steals jewels and runs away.  Kyo-o sends out the army to find her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
