Coincidentally, a man named Kohinata was being apprehended on suspicions of being part of the No Face gang, who robbed the bank and she says that she`ll represent him. Cecil believes his words that it was in self defense, but this also had to do with the fact that her mother was on deathrow on the charges of murder.\nSource: crunchyroll",
