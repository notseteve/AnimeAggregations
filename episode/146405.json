  "description" : "The next day Eita changes his plans to study and instead goes to the rendezvous where Chiwa is supposed to meet Sakagami, and is surprised to see Masuzu already there. Chiwa is made to wait over an hour, and it turns out Sakagami set her up as a bet at her expense, and humiliates her in front of his friends. Masuzu seems to have intended for this to happen so Chiwa would become as cynical as she and Eita are about love, but this infuriates Eita, who charges out to fight Sakagami and his friends in his chuunibyou persona \"Burning Fighting Fighter\", but winds up getting beaten bloody. They are about to attack Chiwa as well, but someone tosses her a pole which she uses like a kendo shinai, and gives them a sound drubbing. The shameful scene exposes Sakagami for the sort of person he is to the whole school.\nMasuzu doesn`t show up for school the next day, and Eita tries to visit her. She meets him out in the street, and as they talk, she suddenly kisses him. As usual her behaviour is ambiguous.",
