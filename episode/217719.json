  "description" : "After being pierced with the arrow, Silver Chariot becomes Chariot Requiem and goes berserk. As a result, everyone’s minds are switched. Among all the confusion, Polnareff reveals himself to Giorno and the others. If someone with power uses the arrow, they would be able to obtain the power to rule over the minds of all living creatures. Polnareff lets them know that there is more to their Stand’s usual Stand ability if they have access to the arrow. Giorno and crew reunite with Bucciarati and they all go to try to steal the arrow back from Chariot Requiem.\nSource: crunchyroll",
