  "description" : "This is the beginning of what is now known as the Winter Siege of Osaka. The Tokugawa army tries to assert its numerical advantage, but Osaka Castle and the Sanada Maru fortification stand firm against them. Yukimura Sanda, Keiji Maeda, Kiyomasa Kato, and Masanori Fukushima fight hard as part of the Toyotomi clan`s forces, refusing to give an inch to their enemies. With winter upon them, a cold wave saps both armies of their energy. That`s when Yukimura has to face off with Kanetsugu Naoe, who he had shared a vow of righteousness with, as an enemy. Meanwhile, as Osaka Castle continues to get bombarded by artillery fire, Nobuyuki Sanada charges in alone in a bid to negotiate a truce.\nSource: crunchyroll",
