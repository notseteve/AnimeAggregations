  "description" : "The club is caught making a disturbance at the infirmary after Himeka tries to seduce Eita, and finally Fuyumi Ai, the chief of the hall monitors, brings the hammer down on them and has their club shut down. Masuzu and Chiwa bait her by saying she`s jealous of their club`s goal of making girls popular, to which she brags that she has a boyfriend named \"Murata Michel Daigorou\" who is obviously completely fictitious, but they can`t actually prove it.\nThe club thus shut down, Eita goes to summer classes, where he finds Ai is in the same class as him. When Masuzu learns about this she orders Eita to try to prove that Ai is lying about having a boyfriend. Ai in the meantime sends clear signals that she likes Eita, and one day when he is having dinner with Ai and Kaoru, Ai is about to admit the truth, but Chiwa and Himeka see them and she is forced to keep up the pretence.",
