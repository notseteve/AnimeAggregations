  "description" : "A Jizo wanted a babysitter. It had been threatening the villagers that it would ruin the village unless they baby-sit it for it. Whenever they send a babysitter, however, the babysitter is eaten to death. So the villagers are forced to hire a traveler, who knows nothing about it, as a babysitter under good conditions. Unaware of the situation, Dororo happily offers herself as a babysitter when she sees the advertisement. Hyakkimaru senses an evil air filling the village. Then he finds out that the Jizo is possessed by a spider-monster. The monster attacks the babysitter tied to the back of the Jizo with a string, and feeds on it.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
