  "description" : "It`s been ten days since the showdown between Maki and Yuki Minaguchi. Maki has been out of it, not sure if she feels good or bad. At Maki`s father, Saeki Shiro`s dojo, a man calling himself Konishi shows up. He says he won`t use his bat and challenges Saeki. The truth is that Konishi is a judo master calling himself the Submission Hunter. The way he speaks is very odd. Honestly speaking, he`s a strange guy. The fight begins quickly but what is surprising is the rate at which he knocks out Saeki`s knees. When asked about his real background, Konishi admits to being in the Fukamichi Ranking. Wanting to know more, Saeki invites him out to a Korean barbeque restaurant. Konishi thought they`d talk while eating but Saeki isn`t letting him eat the meat at all. This irritates Konishi. Their conversation doesn`t work well either. Finally, Saeki admits that he can`t enjoy eating his meal to the max when dining with a guy. As their conversation creeps further into absurdity, Renge shows up, bedazzled by the smell of the Korean barbeque.\nSource: crunchyroll",
