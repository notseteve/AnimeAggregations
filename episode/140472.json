  "description" : "In order to get closer to Ichiko, Momiji transfers into her class, much to Ichiko`s displeasure. As Momiji continues to bother her, Ichiko meets Bobby, a perverted travelling priest with the ability to detect fortune energy, giving her an item called the Soumin Shourai, allowing her to manifest her good fortune into various creatures. Momoji responds by manifesting her own monsters out of her misfortune, but they turn out to be useless and she is soundly beaten.",
