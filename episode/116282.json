  "description" : "Irie and Spanner start up the base unit and try to escape as Kikyo draws near. They decide that the best thing to do right then is to escape, at least until Yamamoto defeats the opponents’ target, Daisy. However, the enemy’s base unit is guarded by a sturdy barrier, and they can’t get through. And Tsuna is still unable to break free of Torikabuto’s illusory space. Gokudera races over to hold Kikyo back, but without his Box Weapon, he is unable to stop her from breaking through into their base unit.\nSource: crunchyroll",
