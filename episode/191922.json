  "description" : "Yuzuki has fallen into the hands of the Oda Army. Rather than blazing ahead and recklessly going into Oda territory to rescue her, Hideyoshi decides to focus on rebuilding the town and his forces, all the while planning his next move. Many of the warlords are left feeling powerless as they worry about Yuzuki`s fate at the hands of Nobunaga Oda. Meanwhile, Yuzuki finds herself confused by Nobunaga`s motives and his actions. Both Hideyoshi and Nobunaga continue to investigate the increasing appearances of the yakuma and find that they seem to have something to do with Yuzuki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
