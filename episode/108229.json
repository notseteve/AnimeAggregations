  "description" : "Eve explains the plan to Lawrence: they will sell Holo to gain cash, which they will then use to buy the fur in town. The fur will then be sold in turn at a profit, and Holo will be bought back. After Lawrence explains it to Holo, she also agrees to the plan, hoping Lawrence will be more selfish and use the profit to achieve his dream. Later, Lawrence`s digging around town reveals that Eve is trading in salt and that the church in town is aiming to become more powerful in the region and Eve had a disagreement with the bishop but Lawrence and Holo resolve to go with Eve`s plan nonetheless.\nSource: Wikipedia",
