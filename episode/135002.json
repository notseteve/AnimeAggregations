  "description" : "Taiki meets his childhood friend Akari again, and the two of them find themselves attending a dinner buffet party at a luxury hotel. Tickets for this party are normally rare since the event is booked full all year round, but somehow Akari won the tickets from a supermarket giveaway. But, of course, Yuu is on the scene! It turns out the whole thing was a trap set by the super celebrity star Digimon, SuperStarmon, to catch the superstar Digimon Hunter, Taiki. When Taiki is taken to the Digimon world, DigiQuartz, Tagiru and the others set out to save him. How will their battle end...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
