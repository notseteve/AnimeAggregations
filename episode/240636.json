  "description" : "Kiyo`s day revolves around cooking and nourishing the maiko. In the morning, she gets ready quietly so as not to disturb the sleeping maiko, makes breakfast and goes grocery shopping after seeing the maiko off. Mid-day, she prepares lunch for the maiko who have returned from lessons, preps ingredients and serves supper to the maiko before they leave for entertaining. At evening time, Kiyo cleans up before going to the public bath and takes a stroll enjoying Kyoto at night.\nSource: crunchyroll",
