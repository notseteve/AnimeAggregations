  "description" : "The Akudarma Trio head to Heian Kyo in the 9th century to find the monk, Kukai, otherwise known as the Professor of Kanji. They find Kukai writing kanji with a giant brush, and on the brush, they also find the Dynamond! They tell him that they want the Dynamond, and he tells them he’ll let them have it if they pass a kanji quiz. That’s when Tokio and Calen show up to join in the kanji quiz. If you watch this episode, you might end up a kanji professor, too!\nSource: crunchyroll",
