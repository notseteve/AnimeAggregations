  "description" : "Eita is convinced that Ai`s boyfriend is real, remaining oblivious to her dubious behaviour towards him, though Masuzu remains sceptical. Nevertheless, after Kaoru invites Eita and Ai to the cinema with free tickets, Masuzu tells him get Ai to fall in love with him, so even if her boyfriend proves to be real they`ll have something to use against her to get the club reinstated. Chiwa tags along paired with Kaoru, while Masuzu follows behind them to observe. On the way to the theatre, Ai is trying to get Eita to remember kindergarten, as it seems they knew each other back then, but Chiwa interferes. The film allows audience interaction and as the relationships between the characters seem to parallel theirs, Ai and Chiwa get caught up, with Eita in the middle.",
