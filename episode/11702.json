  "description" : "In a flashback, Yuta remembers Rin, the daughter of the pirate chief of Toba island, and the ruthless rival pirates of Sakagami island. Isago, the wife of the Sakagami chief, convinces the chief to use his men to hunt mermaids. She also hires Yuta and some other men in a nearby port for the hunt. On Toba, Rin`s father is gravely ill, so Rin leads the raiding parties on passing ships, demanding a tenth of their cargo as a toll, but killing no one. Yuta, drowned in a violent storm while mermaid hunting for Isago, washes up on Toba. As Rin places flowers on Yuta`s grave the next day, he revives. For a time, Yuta lives and works with the Toba islanders. One day Isago sees Yuta and Rin in port. Surprised to see Yuta alive, Isago realizes he is immortal and believes he kept the mermaid she hired him to find. She follows them back to Toba and stabs Rin`s father, telling Rin that only mermaid flesh can stop him from dying. In retaliation, Rin kills Isago.\nSource: Wiki",
