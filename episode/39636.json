  "description" : "The Star Force resumes its quest for a new home for Earthers. Two months go by. In the Skalageck Star Cluster, the Star Force finds the wreckage of the Arizona. It had been attacked by Bolars. Both the Galmans and the Bolars learn that Mariposa is alive and on the Argo. Both dispatch fleets to retreive her. The Bolars want her dead. The Galmans want Mariposa so that she might lead them to Guardiana, which they believe posseses massive military might. Desslok orders his fleet, commanded by Admiral Gustav and already close to attacking the Star Force, to instead protect the Argo from the Bolars. After receiving this order, Gustav actually say -- in English -- \"Shit! That`s unfair! I could have destroyed that lucky ship!\" Well, Gustav, if it`s any consolation, at least you got to say \"Shit!\" on T.V. The Galman fleet is destroyed in the process, but the Argo succeeds in destroying the remaining Bolar fleet with the Wave Motion Gun. But, believing that their mission to find a new home for Earth has essentially failed, Wildstar agrees to take Mariposa home to Guardiana, provided that she lead the way.\n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
