  "description" : "\"Rauzaruk\" surrounds Zatch in a rainbow coloured aura but its effect is unknown. While trying to figure out the effects of \"Rauzaruk\" the rainbow aura disappears and the effects of the spell wear off. Kiyo and Zatch become overwhelmed by Kido`s army of clones. Kiyo realizes that the power Zatch wished for must be the spell`s effect. Casting \"Rauzaruk\" again, Zatch is able to defeat all of Kido`s clones. Zatch reveals that he wanted power to protect Kiyo. Kiyo realizes that \"Rauzaruk\" increases Zatch`s strength, speed, and defense greatly and with that power, they defeat Dr. Riddles and Kido. Dr. Riddles reveals that the latent powers inside Mamodos awaken when they mature spiritually or when the book owner`s feelings reach them. Dr. Riddles then tells Kiyo that the evil one is gathering up minions and that Kiyo`s help will be needed when the time comes.",
