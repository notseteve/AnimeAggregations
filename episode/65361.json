  "description" : "Tsuna suddenly becomes dizzy and a skull mark appears on his hand. According to Reborn, it is the symptom of an incurable illness known as Skullitis. The skull blurts out secrets and embarrassing things that the sick person cannot reveal to anyone until he/she dies. Tsuna panics. Reborn calls in a powerful doctor from Italy to take care of the disease, but the doctor, Dr. Shamal, turns out to be a womanizer who doesn`t examine men. Shamal ignores Tsuna’s pleas for help and chases after Bianchi. Will Tsuna catch up with Shamal and get his help before something disastrous happens?\nSource: crunchyroll",
