  "description" : "The Royal Knights destroyed another location and then made their way to steel town where Takuya and the gang arrive after escaping from the moon. Steel town is mostly buildings made of metal and the sun reflects off them. When the gang walks along the tracks, they run into the Archery-Centaur Digimon Saggitarimon who wants their possessions. When Takuya and the gang refuse, Saggitarimon begins to attack but four new kids appear with an Angemon to drive the Centaur Digimon away. Patamon says that he wants to be like Angemon. Katsuharu, one of the new kids, tells the gang how they arrived in the Digital World. They’re also told that Ophanimon sent most of the children back home since she feared that some of the children might not have what it takes to save the Digital World.\nSource: crunchyroll",
