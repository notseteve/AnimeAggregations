  "description" : "Ash and Goh head to the Galar region to see a phenomenon where Pokémon grow giant-sized, but it’ll be a while before their train departs. Making the best of the layover, they grab a snack, but a mischievous Scorbunny and a trio of Nickit distract them and make off with their food—along with Ash’s backpack! Our heroes pursue the Pokémon, but when Scorbunny gets caught by an angry shopkeeper, Goh tries to help the Pokémon by claiming to be its Trainer! The shop keeper knows the truth, but he lets the Pokémon go, and Ash and Goh eventually return to the train…with Scorbunny secretly trailing close behind!\nSource: Official Website",
