  "description" : "A desolate sand sea glimmering in golden light stretches as far as the eye can see. Albaz and Ecclesia press forward through the harsh terrain, slowly forging a bond through their shared journey. But soon, their journey is cut short by a surprise attack from flying machines. These steel-bodied beings, animated with hearts of soot, are the Springans―the treasure hunters of the Great Sand Sea. By a twist of fate, Albaz and Ecclesia ran into the very group they came seeking. They board the Springans` mobile fortress, the battleship \"Exblowrer,\" where they meet Kitt, a brilliant inventor and younger sister of Ferrijit. Kitt introduces them to the Springans` leader, Sargas, and Ecclesia pleads for Albaz`s protection. But Sargas decides to present the duo with an unexpected challenge.\nSource: Official English Website",
