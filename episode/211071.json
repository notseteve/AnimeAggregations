  "description" : "Subaru has begun living with a cat as a roommate. He realizes he`s run out of cat food and goes to a pet shop to buy more, but starts to panic when he`s surrounded by creatures he`s never been around before. Then Nana, a shop employee, starts to talk to him, asking him questions about the cat`s name and age. Subaru then realizes he hadn`t thought of a name for the cat yet.

As he`s pondering, he comes across a book in his room called \"The Moon and the Sun\"...\nSource: crunchyroll",
