  "description" : "When Shoma awakens from his accident he finds himself in a hospital bed. Kanba and Himari have been watching him overnight, and were glad to find out that he only suffered minor injuries from the accident - although just in case they are keeping him in the hospital for some tests. Meanwhile Ringo believes she doesn`t deserve to see Shoma again and is waiting in the corridor outside his room - it was after all her fault that he was involved in the accident.",
