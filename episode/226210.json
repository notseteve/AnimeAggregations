  "description" : "Mazama Jin here. I`ve been attending Seton Academy for a few months now. Popular people exist everywhere. We may get sick of them sometimes, but there`s always a reason for their popularity. We should not feel inferior or envious, but learn what we can from them and emulate the qualities worth emulating. As for me, I`m going to grow as a person for Hitomi-chan`s sake. Or... maybe I could`ve seen it that way if the new popular person wasn`t that stupid panda.\nSource: crunchyroll",
