  "description" : "Because of her mother`s unrelenting training, high schooler Yuuna can`t date anyone even if she does fall for a boy. Yuuna`s mother was betrayed by her husband, leading to divorce, and the experience has left her unable to trust anyone male. One day, Yuuna`s mother sees Yuuna with a boy she`s been friends with since childhood. Yuuna falls into a depression after her mother scolds her for the \"dirty\" association. Just then, the Child`s-cry Old Man, happens to pass by and drops a scroll. The scroll depicts an extraordinarily beautiful young man, and Yuuna finds herself entranced by the image. Then, the boy comes out of the painting into the real world!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
