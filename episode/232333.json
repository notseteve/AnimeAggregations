  "description" : "Ash and Goh are off to the Johto region, where Ash is hoping for a rematch against Bea. They find Bea training with Gym Leader Chuck at the Cianwood City Gym. Bea accepts Ash’s challenge, and their two-on-two battle begins! First up are Pikachu and Bea’s Hitmontop; Pikachu wins, but then Bea’s Grapploct overwhelms it with Octolock. Next, Ash sends in Riolu, but things are different from the last battle—this time, Riolu doesn’t struggle, and instead focuses its power so it can use Force Palm and break free! After a dizzying exchange of blows, both Pokémon are down, and the battle is declared a draw!\nSource: Official Website",
