  "description" : "Kiyo, Zatch, and Shion chase after Grisor but fail in retrieving the mirror from him in time. Hakase uses the mirror and causes Grisor to grow into a monstrous being which increases his spell power by a hundred fold. They engage in battle but are unable to cause damage to Grisor. When Grisor aims a spell towards Shion, Nya pushes her out of the way but Nya`s book is burnt in the process. Shion holds onto Nya as he disappears from her arms. Grisor then traps Kiyo, Zatch, and Shion on a patch of land by surrounding the area with magma from underground.",
