  "description" : "Waiting for Hiyori and her friends to reach the Tower are two giant KUGE statues. Kikka and Naomitsu tell Hiyori to go ahead towards Teruto while they gear up to take down the statues. However, standing before Naomitsu is his \"sibling,\" while in front of Kikka stands Kikka herself when she was King. Even as an illusion, Naomitsu cannot do anything because he does not want to fight his \"siblings.\" Kikka, blamed for the things she did when she was King, also is unable to demonstrate her usual strength. Will they both be defeated as they are? Just then, who appeared in front of Naomitsu...? And what came to Kikka`s mind...?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
