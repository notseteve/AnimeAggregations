  "description" : "The \"Smart Safe\" has come to the Greater Tokyo Bank. Created by the Hirameki brothers, a pair of inventors, it`s a safe that analyzes the \"brain power\" of anyone that tries to open it. Not only that, but unless the brain power reads as 0, it won`t open under any circumstances. Lupin is goaded by Fujiko and Jigen to try and crack the technological wonder, but his brain power is rated at 300! What can he do against this peculiarly secure safe?\nSource: crunchyroll",
