  "description" : "Akane is having a romantic summer date with male Natsuru at the pool. However, Mikoto, Shizuku and Kaede show up as well. At the pool, Shizuku sees 3 White Kämpfers when they walked past Kaede. Shizuku sends female Natsuru to walk alone somewhere and is attacked and surrounded by a group of White Kämpfer, who introduce themselves as Sayaka Nakao, Ryōka Yamakawa and Hitomi Minagawa. Akane and Shizuku rescue Natsuru and to his dismay, Shizuku essentially says Natsuru was used as bait to get the White Kämpfer to reveal themselves, who end up running away rather than fight them on equal terms. Later male Natsuru and the girls are having a fun time in the hotel. Akane and Mikoto are in shock that Natsuru went on a date with Shizuku, and Shizuku even goes so far as to kiss Natsuru in front of the others. Kaede then asks male Natsuru to come with her outside the room. Natsuru, captivated by Kaede`s sudden action, obliges without a second thought. Outside the room, Kaede manipulates the spellbound Natsuru into obeying her and they go outside to see the fireworks. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
