  "description" : "After the deadly battle, the Saints of the Sanctuary all swear their loyalty to Saori—Athena. Meanwhile, Eris, who was thought to have been sealed, had fused with her host, Kyoko, and multiplied her powers. Saori rises against Eris to protect Shoko, but receives the curse of the apple. The Gold Saints head to the Temple of Eris along with the Saintias to save Athena and to stop the evil god from scattering the Evil Seeds of war that fill people’s hearts with hate. That’s where Aiolia witnesses his own brother turning his fists against him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
