  "description" : "Holo, Lawrence, and Nora sit down to have dinner together, but Holo`s animosity toward Nora prevents her from enjoying it. Later, Holo falls ill due to fatigue and is forced to rest for a few days. She dreams and reminisces about her past and her journey so far with Lawrence, realizing her affection for him is intensifying. Lawrence treats Holo`s fever and fatigue by feeding her and balancing the four states, the hot, cold, dry, and wet. Over the course of her sickness, Holo grows closer to Lawrence, but Holo`s aversion to Nora continues to cause problems. Nora visits Holo, however, and makes amends after sharing a joke at Lawrence`s expense.\nSource: Wiki",
