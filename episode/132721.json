  "description" : "As the 2nd years` forces are dwindling, Minami and Akihisa enter the battlefield. After escaping from Miharu, Minami faints from fear. As a result, Akihisa lets her rest and goes with Mizuki. As Mizuki is telling off Akihisa for calling her a princess, the room becomes pitch black and Akihisa then pairs with Yuuji, while Mizuki finds Shouko. As the Tokonatsu duo prepare to battle the pair of girls, Mizuki screams at the seniors for degrading Akihisa and Yuuji, causing the girls to get eliminated. After hearing Mizuki, Akihisa and Yuuji battle the Tsunemura and Natsukawa. After outwitting the Todonatsu duo, Akihisa and Yuuji win. Afterwards, Akihisa apologizes to Mizuki, who forgives him, requests that he calls her by first name, and kisses his cheek, telling him that her crush from season 1 (Akihisa himself) is still strong. Afterwards, Minami comes and asks why Akihisa didn`t stay with her, causing misunderstanding and confusion, and Akihisa is chased by the girls. Yuuji also runs away from Shouko, who demands marriage for not finishing the challenge with her. Then, all the students and Iron Man run outside in a circle.",
