  "description" : "\"This might sound cocky, but I want to be my own person so I can stand shoulder to shoulder with you.\"\nVAZZY`s brothers Issa and Futaba Kiduku receive an invitation to co-star in an original drama series. At first, older brother Issa is asked to play the straight-laced big brother Ryo and younger Futaba is asked to play the reckless little brother Itsuki. However, on the advice of show planner Taiga Orihara—an old rival of Issa`s from his rock band years—the roles are reversed. While Issa`s genius-level acting skills allow him to slip into his role with ease, Futaba struggles to take on the persona of an `older brother.` Fellow Tsukino Productions members Haru Yayoi, Shiki Takamura, and Gaku Oguro then show up to form a new group called The Oniichans and teach Futaba what it`s like to be a big brother.\nSource: crunchyroll",
