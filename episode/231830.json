  "description" : "Round 2 of the inter-academy exams begins. After Revest`s deplorable defeat against Heine, Anos and his team battle with the students of the Hero Academy. Anos says that he will think of a strategy if it becomes necessary, and clashes head-on with his enemies using his vast Magic Powers. However, due to a magic barrier called De Igelia that is cast over the entire city, and a young girl named Zeshia who wields the holy sword Enhale, Anos` attacks prove to be futile. Anos and his team are unable to come up with their next strategy, but Misha proposes a plan that could help them win.\nSource: crunchyroll",
