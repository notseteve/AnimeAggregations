  "description" : "Fifteen years ago, a young Hameline, having been infected, was imprisoned in Rumble Town along with three other infected children. When Major Oxumare of the Inquisition stands up for the children, a young Konrad kills him and frames the children for his mutiny. Frightened, the people had the entire district where the prison was removed from the island to plunge into the abyss. This is the truth of what happened fifteen years ago. The sole survivor of that incident, Hameline, has been awaiting this moment to take revenge.\nSource: crunchyroll",
