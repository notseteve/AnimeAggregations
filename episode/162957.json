  "description" : "Tobitatsu Haneru took up dancing inspired by Jey, the superstar. Although short in stature, he more than makes up for it with his big moves and jumps. On this day, he heads to his usual practice grounds by parkouring his way across town. He begins practicing as soon as he gets there by looking at his reflection on the glass windows. Little did he know that he was being watched from the other side by a girl who`d also come to practice dancing, Otosaki Kanon.\nSource: crunchyroll",
