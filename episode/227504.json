  "description" : "It’s time for Professor Cerise’s Pokémon Orienteering session! Three teams of young kids will head to Vermilion Port, and the team that arrives first (while spotting the most Pokémon en route) wins! Ash and Goh serve as guides: Goh’s team marvels at how many Pokémon he’s caught, and Ash’s team is delighted when he shows off his battling skills. But when Team Rocket threatens to steal everyone’s Pokémon, Ash and Goh come up with a combination move that sends the villains blasting off again! The kids are full of admiration for Ash and Goh, and the professor declares this Pokémon Orienteering session a rousing success!\nSource: Official Website",
