  "description" : "The fifth and sixth graders are being taught how to snowboard by a top snowboarder in Japan, 11-year-old Mifuyu Torii. Amu`s Guardian Characters detect that Mifuyu is about to create a powerful Heart`s Egg, which also doesn`t go unnoticed by Nikaidou. That evening, Mifuyu is about to compete in the preliminaries for a snowboarding competition. However, she becomes scared. When Mifuyu wishes to become brave and break her habit of becoming frightened before competing, her Guardian Egg appears and Snoppe hatches from it. With Snoppe`s help, Mifuyu is able to compete calmly in the preliminaries. Nikaidou sees Snoppe and realizes that Guardian Characters are born from powerful Heart`s Eggs. Attempting to harness that power, he confronts Mifuyu and causes her to begin to doubt herself. These negative emotions cause Snoppe to turn into an X Egg and Nikaidou quietly makes off with it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
