  "description" : "Kō doubts her capacity to serve as the Mizuchi sentinel after causing several mishaps while trying to help out in the household chores and also after making Tōru feel uneasy by asking him questions regarding his mother. Kūgen then goes out to harvest ingredients for the gourmet dinner that she wants to eat. Tōru also leaves home, rejecting Kō`s offer to accompany him. Noboru finds the disheartened Kō, whom he encourages by explaining that Tōru`s unease stems from his lack of memories about their mother. Kō follows after Tōru to find him ensnared by an Edamame Bean Woman. During the fight, Kō`s face glows from the glowing scales on her face and her dragon race origins are discovered. The Bean Woman unwittingly discloses to Tōru that he was always under the protection of his mother`s spirit. Kūgen arrives to free Tōru from the giant beanstalks, allowing Kō to unleash her full powers against the Yokai.\nSource: crunchyroll",
