  "description" : "Sakura found out there was going to be a moon festival at Tsukimine Shrine and invited Xiaolang to go along with all of us. Sakura was really tired in the days leading up to the festival because she was staying up late knitting a scarf for Xiaolang as a thank you for all of his help. At the festival, I tried talking to Xiaolang into telling Sakura how he felt about her, but he was too worried that it would just give her something else to worry about. The lights at the festival went out, and after dealing with a magical horse (that I finally got to record!), Sakura used the Glow card to keep the festival going.\nSource: crunchyroll",
