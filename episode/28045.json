  "description" : "While Bokko says it`s about time that they passed judgment on the earth, Bukko maintains that the investigation isn`t over yet. Bokko gets irritated, saying that if they let the Galactic League wait any longer, they might not be able to go back to their own planet. He hides on a truck parked nearby the antiproton bomb that they plan to use if they should decide to destroy the earth. The truck belongs to a gang member, and the gang drives it away to rob the bank, still carrying the antiproton bomb.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
