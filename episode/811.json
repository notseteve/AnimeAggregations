  "description" : "As Haru, Elie, and Plue prepare to head the north, they are to be escorted by Griffon Kato. Griff informs them that they will stop at Ska Village as a checkpoint, then continue on their way toward Experiment City. While at a nearby hot spring, Elie decides to twist Plue`s nose to discover anything unusual, which leads to Plue deflated. Haru and Elie make an effort to return Plue to normal. However, this results in an argument between the two. Griff tells Elie to go to a nearby strawberry valley to retrieve a special strawberry that will help cure Plue. After retrieving the strawberry, she is then confronted by an insect monster. Haru arrives to defeat the insect monster and to rescue Elie. When they went back, they saw that Plue was already back to normal. However, Elie realizes that the hot spring caused Plue`s deflation.\nSource: wiki",
