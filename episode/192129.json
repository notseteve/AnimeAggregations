  "description" : "The evil trio head to Tokyo in the 38th year of the Meiji period to find the famous writer Natsume Soseki, who wrote classics such as “I Am a Cat,” and “Botchan.” They are greeted by a black cat who leads them to a gentleman with a magnificent moustache. Could it be Natsume Soseki? He apparently is having a hard time coming up with his next title and tells the evil trio that he’ll give them the Dynamond if they can help him with his new work, and that’s when Tokio and Calen show up. Because Soseki loves sweets, they decide to have a sweets battle!\nSource: crunchyroll",
