  "description" : "Forcibly possessed by Nine Tails, Izumo strains her energy to cry for help as the demon`s power overwhelms her. Rin answers Izumo`s cry for help, exorcises the bloated Zombie and finds himself standing in the way of Michael Gedoin. Gedoin, confused and impatient with the unexpected situation, unleashes more Zombies on Rin and the others to buy time. As Yukio and the rest of the group come rushing to fight back, Izumo begins to be swallowed up by Nine Tails` madness, which she cannot subdue and is losing control.\nSource: crunchyroll",
