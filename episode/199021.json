  "description" : "A second moon has appeared in the sky! It`s growing steadily closer and it`s stopped in the sky above Tokyo Bay. Meanwhile, the 808 tanuki sealed away in Japan over 200 years ago have hijacked the radio waves and announced that they will take over the Japanese government. On her way to ask Kitaro for help, Mana is captured as an anti-tanuki threat. To save Mana, Kitaro and the others head into the vast underground space where the tanuki are hiding. At the same time, the Japanese government shoots down the second moon with a missile. The huge object that falls into Tokyo Bay is actually the egg of a particular yokai... Will Kitaro be able to thwart the tanuki`s plot?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
