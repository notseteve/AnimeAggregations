Daibazaal learns of this and along with Sincline begins to assassinate leaders of the rebel planets. Meanwhile, Sincline attempts a truce with Fala but instead locks swords with “Chief” Kogane and seriously injures the Black Lion pilot. Can Fala rise the occasion and form the head of GoLion without Kogane?\nSource: crunchyroll",
