  "description" : "Unico the Unicorn has the amazing power to make anyone he meets happy. Whether it`s because of his personality or the powers of his horn, no one knows. However, the gods become jealous of Unico, thinking that only they should be able to decide or allow people to be happy. Unico is banished to the Hill of Oblivion, and the West Wind is ordered to take him there. She can`t stand giving this fate to Unico, so Unico`s adventures begin, as the West Wind takes him from one place and time to the next, in a never ending journey to escape the wrath of the gods.\nSource: crunchyroll",
