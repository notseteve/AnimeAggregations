He had already anticipated all of it, and was confident they could all weather the attack if they did what was required of them.\nSo following Tsukasa`s emergency manual, Domundt manages to avoid the worst case scenario. However, the Heaven`s Flames aren`t stopping. The fire spirits unleashed by the spell are compelled to continue their attack until the city burns to the ground.\nFaced with a predicament even their missiles couldn`t stop, the world`s strongest swordsman, Ichijou Aoi, rises to the challenge.\nSource: crunchyroll",
