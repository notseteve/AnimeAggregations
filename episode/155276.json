  "description" : "Visor is shocked that there seem to be no customers, and while at first it seems that it`s because of the poisonous pond Fino put in front of the store, after they fill it in they realise that it is actually because Amada Magic, the largest chain of big box stores of magic items in the country, has just set up a branch nearby. Fino and Raul investigate the new store, and find to their dismay that it has a much a wider selection of goods and lower prices, so much so that Leon cannot profitably match them. They suddenly run into Airi who seems to be working there.",
