  "description" : "Kero and Sakura got in a big fight, and Kero ran away from home... After falling asleep on the street, he woke up to find himself in a strange apartment. It turned out that a little girl named Akane had found him and brought him back to where she and her mother lived together, just the two of them. Sakura and I went looking for him, but it was no use. Meanwhile, Akane was left home alone while her mother went to work, and Kero decided he couldn`t just leave her there by herself. Just then, the Float card came and carried Akane high up into the sky. Kero tried his best to go after her; but he just couldn`t keep up. All of a sudden, Sakura rushed in and sealed Float away! She had asked me t help track down where he was, and managed to arrive just in time. A few days later, Akane was forced to part ways with Kero when she and her mother moved to a new city. A little embarrassed by the whole thing, Kero bashfully returned home with Sakura.\nSource: crunchyroll",
