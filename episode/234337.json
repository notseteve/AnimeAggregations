  "description" : "It’s the Pokémon Grand Eating Contest, and our heroes are hungry to compete! Ash and Dragonite, along with Goh and Skwovet, are up against several previous eating contest winners, including the world-renown Emperor Blaziken. And rounding out the contestants? Team Rocket and Morpeko, who’s hangrier than ever! One by one, contestants are eliminated until two remain: Skwovet and Morpeko. But after pushing Morpeko too far, Team Rocket blasts off again—which means Skwovet has to eat just one more plate of food to win! Although it seems Skwovet has already eaten its fill, it suddenly evolves into a Greedent, surpasses Morpeko’s food plate tally, and wins the contest!\nSource: Official Website",
