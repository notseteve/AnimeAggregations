  "description" : "A new client has arrived. This time it`s an AI drone, named Doron, that Smiley dug out of a garbage pile. With it`s memory missing, it asks the club to find it`s missing owner. After examining Doron, it becomes apparent that Doron is an illegal drone that isn`t registered with the customer center. And on top of that, the only camera data still in their files appears to be of an avatar that is fighting against Phantom Zero.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
