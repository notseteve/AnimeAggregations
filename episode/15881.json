  "description" : "The Woodmon are chasing Ogremon trying to catch him so they can take his digital data. Ogremon is then traped under a tree when a giant meteor slams into the ground. The Woodmon all run away and Joe and Mimi show up and help Ogremon. At first, Ogremon didn`t want their help, but over time he becomes their friend. The other kids find their way into Puppetmon`s house and begin to look around. However, outside the house Puppetmon finds Joe and Mimi, unlikely as it is, MetalEtemon shows up and saves them. Back inside the house, Tai and the other kids find two of Puppetmon`s guards. One of the guards leads them to a cannon that can be used against Puppetmon. Finally, as exspected, MetalEtomon turns on Joe and Mimi and chases them through the Jungle, but during the case something that looks like Leomon appears.\nSource: crunchyroll",
