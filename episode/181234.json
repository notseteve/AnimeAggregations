  "description" : "Akechi is relaxing at a spa to relieve the exhaustion of his recent cases. A story about the security robot incident, the organ-selling incident, and the underground waterway kidnapping incident come on the TV, discussing a \"mysterious cooperant\" who resolved them all... in other words, Akechi himself. Then Nakamura asks him about his history with Twenty Faces, and Akechi begins to recount the trauma of his youth. Meanwhile, Hanasaki also carries the weight of a checkered past, as he`s summoned home by his father.\nSource: crunchyroll",
