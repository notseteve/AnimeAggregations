  "description" : "Kimihito finds that the three monster girls have difficulty getting along, and he is in the middle. At one point the fighting between them gets so out of hand that Ms. Smith has to intervene, but she winds up shooting Kimihito with the tranquilliser darts instead. The girls are chastened by the incident and promise to behave themselves, while Kimihito declares that they are supposed to be like family. After receiving Centorea`s application forms Smith offhandedly mentions that there are some amendments to the law that are coming that will legalise inter-species marriage, but forgets to mention that it is a night of a full moon. That night the full moon combined with all the talk of marriage makes all the three girls crazy, and Kimihito has to flee from them and it is only when he falls onto a bottle of ketchup making them all think he was killed that they sober up. The next morning, Kimihito, sporting bandages from the rough night, says that it is his fault for being indecisive, and promises to date all three of them with an eye to marriage.",
