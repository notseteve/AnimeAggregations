  "description" : "Zazie comes back after having lost important letters, and he`s injured, too.  As the rumor goes around that Zazie threw away the letters in order to escape from the gaichuu, another Letter Bee is to be dispatched from the Bee-Hive to recover the letters and finish the delivery. Lag jumps in to volunteer, but it seems that Zazie braved a dangerous route spotted with gaichuu territories.\nSource: crunchyroll",
