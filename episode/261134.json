  "description" : "On his way to Fezzan, Julian spends several days at Heinessen. Here, he pays a visit to Bewcock to hand over a strictly confidential letter from Yang, which exposes his conjectures about the possible move the Imperial forces are likely to make. As Julian finally reaches Fezzan, he is immediately mesmerized by the freedom and affluence that surrounds him, and starts seriously wondering whether he will ever be apt to his new mission.\nSource: crunchyroll",
