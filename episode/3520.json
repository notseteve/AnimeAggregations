  "description" : "I decided to invite Sakura over to my house, and while she was there, my mother told us all kinds of interesting stories about Nadeshiko and Sakura`s father that we had never heard before. Afterwards, I told Sakura about a box of mine that had something very special in it, but which was stuck shut. Sakura figured out that the Shield card was what was keeping it from opening, so she used her Sword card to seal Shield away and open up the box! And with it open, I was able to show her the cherry blossom bouquet that Sakura`s mother had carried on her wedding day... along with my most precious possession- an eraser that my very best friend Sakura, had given to me.\nSource: crunchyroll",
