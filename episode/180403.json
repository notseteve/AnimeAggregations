  "description" : "Kobayashi somehow feels that maybe he can die if he stays with Hanasaki, so he joins the Boy Detectives` Club. His first mission is to help find a jobless young man who`s gone missing. The club starts by receiving files on missing persons from Detective Nakamura and her subordinate, Miyanishi, who are facing an investigation of their own now after a medical examiner went missing. They were all set to begin the search, but when the mysterious and socially awkward Kobayashi perpetually clashes with Inoue and Noro, he tries to make a run for it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
