  "description" : "Ever since he was young, Jiraiya has been a little pervy. He tries to involve Orochimaru in many of his exploits as well as his schemes to get Tsunade’s attention. In Kakashi`s story, we see him living on his own since his father, Sakumo, died. Rin and Obito are fascinated by Kakashi, but his aloofness makes him hard to figure out.\nSource: crunchyroll",
