  "description" : "Lately, some strange things had been going on at our school... We came to school one morning to find that the school grounds and classrooms had been completely trashed by someone, or something! Sakura sensed a Clow Card on the loose, so she, Kero, and I all snuck our way into the school later that night to investigate! There, we discovered the culprit- the Shadow card! Luckily, I was able to help distract the card and Sakura managed to coax Shadow back into the Clow Book. That was also my first chance to become the director and producer of all of Sakura`s incredible celluloid adventures to come! Ahh, I was so happy!\nSource: crunchyroll",
