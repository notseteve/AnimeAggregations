  "description" : "A few days after being completely defeated by the woman, Yuki Minaguchi, Kinjiro Kitaeda puts on a new Shizuna-man outfit dubbed Shizuna-man Version 2. But once Nagato saw him in that armor, the atmosphere suddenly changes. He doesn`t seem like the normal, passionate Kin-chan... Wanting to test out Shizuna-man Version 2, Shizuna takes Kin-chan directly to a park that night. Kin-chan starts to realize his power, but somewhere in his heart he feels uneasy. But, he cannot conceal the greatness of the power he`s received. But something is different... His opponent is Lucha Master, who is giving him all he`s got in return. What happened to the fight he expected?\nSource: crunchyroll",
