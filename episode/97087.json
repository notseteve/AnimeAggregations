  "description" : "Rinne Amagane`s new school is really something else. The other girls are ghoulish, the teachers are terrifying, and the headmaster is Hellvis, a demon in tight pants with a craving for rock `n` roll. There`s just one problem: Rinne`s not actually supposed to be here! Sanzu River Academy is nestled in the heart of Destinyland, and while it might sound like fun, it`s literally Hell. And to get to Hell, Rinne had to have died--except, she never did. When Rinne meets others like her, living people in a world of the dead, she learns that Hellvis is more than just a hip-swaying schoolmaster, he`s also the reason Hell has turned upside down! And that`s just the start of the story, which stretches back all the way to the very first humans on Earth. Don`t worry, though. So long as you have spirit, anything is possible!\nSource: crunchyroll",
