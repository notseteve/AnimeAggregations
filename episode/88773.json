Reborn is holding this event to entertain Nana, who is always taking care of everyone. But with a name that includes “Vongola-style,” it can`t be normal. At the party, Nana selects a winner by giving points to people who reveal their secret talents. The chances that the winner`s wish will be granted is, amazingly, 100 percent!
