  "description" : "April. Exactly one year ago, Suzuki Yua (Yua-senpai), Sato Hina (Hiina), and Takahashi Aoi invited Tanaka Koharu (Koharun) to join their \"Tesaguri Club\". Now, Koharun looks back on the year that was. Over the last 12 months, the four of them thought about many different clubs and postulated an abundance of new wrinkles. Koharun became a member because she wanted to have a high school life that was out of the ordinary and somewhere along the line, her wish came true. But then third-year students Yua and Hiina graduated. While Aoi and Koharun set up the same table in the same place as the previous year so they can invite new students to join, they reminisce about the last 12 months. What kind of new students will join the club this year?\nSource: crunchyroll",
