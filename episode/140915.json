  "description" : "As the second match gets underway, Harue starts having practise matches with Kuro in order to revive her dora drawing ability. Izumi is put under pressure by Yoshiko and Sumire. Yuu, on the other hand, had been taught by Harue about an unconscious tell of Sumire`s which gives away who she is targeting, giving her the opportunity to strike back at her. After the second round ends, the third round begins and soon turns into a heated battle between Ako, Sera and Shiraitodai`s Shibuya Takami.\nSource: Wikipedia",
