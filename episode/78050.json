  "description" : "Karakura First High School`s kendo team is ambushed, and the captain and all of the main members are seriously injured. The injured team members are worried they`ll have to pull out of the regional tournament the following month, but the student body president, Kego`s sister Mizuho, suggests that they have a practice match against their attackers. With all the regulars injured, however, only the freshmen are left. Mizuho asks Ikkaku to train the remaining team members, and for some reason Ikkaku accepts the request. And so begins Ikkaku`s training from hell.\nSource: crunchyroll",
