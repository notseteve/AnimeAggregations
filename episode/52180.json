  "description" : "Autumn has come; the sisters watch the falling leaves of the sakura tree in front of their room`s window - and observe their lodging`s owner doing the same. To their bewilderment the owner addressed them as \"Eriko\" and \"Nami\" and allows them to delay their payment of rent for the first time ever.\nA couple of days later both sisters meet the owner who tells the girls to move out their location as soon as possible! The house is about to be torn down and rebuilt to provide more expensive apartments - which means that the precious sakura tree will also be gone soon.",
