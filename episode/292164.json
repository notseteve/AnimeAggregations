  "description" : "PROTOSTAR is the only group that hasn`t had their live release concert. Lin and Maoto look at the metrics of the LEGIT and JAXX/JAXX performances, and talk in anticipation about what sort of show PROTOSTAR will put on for them. They imagine it will be a performance that was unthinkable when sMiLea Production first started up as an agency. The unknown past of the once legendary idols` transition to becoming producers is revealed. Meanwhile, Akira and the other idols in the group are showing some unsettling behavior behind Lin, Maoto, and Harumi`s backs.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
