  "description" : "The Juni Taisen takes place once every twelve years. The participating warriors must kill each other until only one remains; this winner will have one wish granted. Warrior of the Boar, Inonoshishi, is the daughter of the last Taisen`s winner. She sabotaged and destroyed her little sister in order to take her place at the Taisen, because her pride as eldest daughter could not withstand the thought of being displaced. She uses her skill \"Non-Reload\" and swears to win elegantly, but she ends up fighting her first enemy in an unexpected way.\nSource: crunchyroll",
