  "description" : "Sakura`s father had been working day and night getting ready for an upcoming presentation, even staying in his office overnight to finish it. So Sakura decided to visit him on campus to bring him some food, and she invited me along. Sakura`s so wonderful! But the Sleep card had also appeared and put Mr. Kinomoto and his assistants to sleep. Sakura managed to corner sleep in her father`s office and seal it away, but all of his lecture materials were destroyed in the struggle. Sakura tearfully apologized to him, and he gently replied that he would just start over. That night, Sakura saw that he stayed up all night rewriting his lecture, so the next day she offered to do whatever she could to help him. So he asked her to become his personal assistant for the day making her extremely happy that she was able to help her father.\nSource: crunchyroll",
