  "description" : "Now that Tuesday has suffered a terrible burn, she is no longer able to play guitar for her imminent Mars Brightest performance. Carole continues to be troubled by her past and is unable to synch up with Tuesday in any case. Will they be able to pull it together in time, and even so, how can they even hope to compete without Tuesday`s brilliant accompaniment? Who would pull such a horrible prank on Tuesday, anyway? Everyone has a theory, but these theories only serve to illustrate the lack of trust abounding in their relationships.",
