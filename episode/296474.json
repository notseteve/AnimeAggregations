  "description" : "Nico and Morihito were at their classmate Kara Minami`s house. Kara had invited them over so they could recover Kara`s shredded up letter. Nico tells Kara that in order to use the spell \"Witch Recovery,\" the parts of the item need to be somewhat gathered. Since there were other shredded pieces of paper in the pile, it would be difficult for the spell to succeed. The letter that Kara wanted to have Nico recover is a letter from her departed mother that her father had put in the shredder.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
