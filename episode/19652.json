  "description" : "Zatch finds a fragment of a mirror while diving for yellowtail. Kiyo and Zatch befriends a new transfer student, Shion and her cat Nya. Soon they are attacked by a Man and his Mamodo, Cut and Paste, who demands Zatch`s mirror piece. \"Zaker\" proves ineffective against him as it gets redirected by Cut and Paste`s scissors and \"Rashield\" is too weak Cut and Paste`s attacks. Cut and Paste use their strongest spell to summon a giant scissor missile. Kiyo and Zatch manage to defeat them by redirecting the scissor towards Cut and Paste with \"Jikerdor\". In the distance, a mysterious Mamodo pair observe Kiyo and Zatch. Shion with a dark expression asks Zatch if she could have the mirror.",
