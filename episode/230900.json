  "description" : "Subaru was caught and confined by Garfiel, but Otto shows up to rescue him. Garfiel can`t leave the graveyard while Emilia is undergoing the trial, so Otto says this is their chance to get outside the barrier, but Subaru doesn`t agree. However, after he learns that Ram will be helping them—that she has been ordered by Roswaal to help him, in fact—Subaru puts his escape on hold to have a talk with Roswaal.\nSource: crunchyroll",
