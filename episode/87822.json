  "description" : "The Guardians meet with child magician Zero, who is also fourth-grade student at the school named Takuya Nakagura. Takuya tells the Guardians about how he loves performing magic. However, as he became more popular, his manager did not want Takuya to perform real magic on stage, instead relying on CG effects. To help, the Guardians organize a magic show where Takuya performs under an alias. After the performance, Takuya talks about an imaginary friend named Zero, who turns out to be his Guardian Character. Amu also confides her suspicions about Nikaidou with the other Guardians. At the studio, Takuya learns that he has been fired, and Nikaidou attempts to turn Zero into an X Egg. The guardians arrive at the studio just in time to see Nikaidou leave, but Zero has already become an X Character. Amu does a Character Transformation with Miki, becoming Amulet Spade and purifies Zero.\nSource: crunchyroll",
