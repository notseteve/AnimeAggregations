  "description" : "Exploring the strange world they wound up in, the heroine and Y encounter her assistant, who had also gotten himself stuck. They deduce that in order to proceed through the panels, they must do something dramatic enough to make a printed sound effect materialize. They also realize they can draw things into existence, as well as understand that if their manga becomes too boring, they will descend into cancellation. As such, the trio start going through various genres to make it through the manga world. After encountering some fairies, they realize that in order to escape, they need to reach the ending, though a desire for ratings soon leads the stories into a complicated mess. The manga soon becomes unpopular and ends up getting cancelled, but thankfully they manage to end up back in the real world.",
