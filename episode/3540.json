  "description" : "After school one day, the girls and I ended up going to a used bookstore, but Sakura noticed the presence of a Clow Card. Since the area was so crowded, we decided to come back later that night to capture the card. When we came back, Xiaolang and Meiling showed up, and Kero and Meiling started arguing until we saw a huge cat walking around toward us! The cat chased us, but was happy to just cuddle with Xiaolang until Sakura captured the Big card, and the cat returned to normal. Just when we thought we were done for the day, animals with strange wings and swirly eyes started popping up everywhere. It turns out someone was using the Create card and everything they were writing was coming true! We were going to save capturing it until the next day, but then a huge dragon appeared and started heading toward town, so Sakura used the Big card on herself and fought the dragon! Just when it looked like Sakura was going to lose, the person stopped writing, and Sakura was able to capture the Create card, too!\nSource: crunchyroll",
