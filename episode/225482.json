  "description" : "As Mizusaki is banned from joining the anime club by her parents, the only way for the three of them to make anime is to set up a new club. At the staff room, their teacher tells them that they will be granted a certain budget if the objective of their club was to create a live-action movie. Kanamori suggest that they will call their club “Eizou (Film) club” and use its name as a disguise. Thus “ Eizou-ken” came into existence! They head off to a storage space previously used by the anime club and realized all kinds of treasures behind the door!\nSource: crunchyroll",
