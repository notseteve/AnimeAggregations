  "description" : "While Kirino has her school friends over, she receives a package from Saori, unaware it is a collection of otaku goods, forcing Kyousuke to stop her from opening it in front of her regular friends, but his attempts to protect it from her land them in an even more awkward situation. As way of apology for the incident, Kirino forces Kyousuke to take her to Summer Comiket, along with Saori and Kuroneko.",
