  "description" : "Yasunobu talks with Yamato about the relationship, when Miki interrupts and gets in a heated argument with Yasunobu over her headstrong personality. The entire track-and-field team has been grumbling over Honoka`s no-show, and for good reason after they learn what happened from Yamato. Miki had heard from Suzuka on what happened, and confronts Yamato about it. Yamato gives the same lie he gave Suzuka, but Miki isn`t fooled and fishes out the truth. She then has Yamato treat her to dinner at an okonomiyaki place where she gets to understand Yamato a little better. Meanwhile Nana helps cheer Honoka up, and she gets brave enough to continue managing the track and field team with the hopes of confessing to Yamato properly in the future.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
