  "description" : "A week after their victory, Kagami`s class celebrates a party. They meet Koutarou for the first time and are fascinated, though almost everyone still believes him to be a girl. His former classmates, whom Kagami has invited, see him, and he implores them not to tell everyone who he really is. They agree, but say he is just as gross as he was before.\nKagami then sets up a special battle event in the game: The First vs. Luce. If The First is victorious, he will reveal an important secret about Luce. Hundreds of other players join in on the First`s side, while every member of Kagami`s class and Makina join in on Luce`s side. They put up a valiant effort but ultimately they are defeated, and The First confronts Luce in a final battle for being a coward who hides behind those weaker than himself. As Luce defeats him, he finally gains the courage to admit to his true name: Araki Koutarou. After the battle, he does the same in the real world, and Kagami`s students warmly greet their lost classmate.",
