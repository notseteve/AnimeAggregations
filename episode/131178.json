  "description" : "Rintaro tells Ruka about how she used to be a male and urges her to reverse the D-Mail responsible in order to change Mayuri`s fate. While she initially doesn`t believe him, she later agrees to do so on the condition that Rintaro takes her on a date. Despite Kurisu and Daru`s advice on dating, Rintaro and Ruka spend their date together in awkward conversation. Like Faris, Ruka eventually recalls the previous World Line where she was a male, distressing her as a return to it would prevent her from pursuing her feelings for Rintaro. Before sending the D-Mail that would negate Ruka`s first one, Rintaro realizes that the reason they did not enjoy their date was that he was trying to be someone he was not. As a result, Rintaro returns to the shrine and spends the rest of the day training with Ruka like they used to. With their relationship repaired, Rintaro sends the D-Mail, moving back to a World Line where Ruka is a boy, leaving the next D-Mail to be reversed: Moeka`s. \nSource: Wikipedia",
