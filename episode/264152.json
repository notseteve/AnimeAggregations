  "description" : "Why did Chris shoot Finn? Why did he steal the cards? What are his intentions? High Card is at a loss as to what to make of Chris` puzzling behavior that turned him into a fugitive. Finn suggests that they find Chris first on their own, but Leo disagrees, since Owen Alldays, Theodore`s secretary, is working to secure Chris under the direct order of the president. In the meantime, the Klondike Family is preparing to invade as they try to rise in rebellion once again.\nSource: crunchyroll",
