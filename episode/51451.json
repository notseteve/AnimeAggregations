  "description" : "While searching for Tetsuro, Maetel encounters a mechanical body salesman named Snowlock. At the same time, we learn that the \"Death upon glancing\" rumor was made up by the aforementioned salesman. It was to keep the Snow Woman from giving away free mechanical bodies. However, she plans to turn Tetsuro into a cyborg, then take his body to go eat hot ramen. Then Tetsuro decides he`ll agree to make ramen that even she can eat that will warm her all the way to her heart.\nSource: crunchyroll",
