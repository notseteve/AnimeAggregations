  "description" : "Edo is in an uproar about the serial kidnappings of women. The Shinsengumi goes overboard in cracking down and sees a sudden drop in their public image. Kondo invites pop idol Tsu Terakado to be chief for the day in order to call on Edo residents to prevent crimes, as well as to boost the Shinsengumi`s image. Otsu is eager to do her duty and begins reforming the Shinsengumi, beginning with the bureau`s regulations. The Odd Jobs Trio are asked by Otsu to accompany her dressed up as the uninspiring mascot character Makoto-chan. The Shinsengumi realizes who they are and a fight breaks out. While they fight, someone kidnaps Otsu.\nSource: crunchyroll",
