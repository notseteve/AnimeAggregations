  "description" : "Lambo looks like he`s going to win the Lightning Guardian battle when he turns into his Twenty-years later form, but just before he can, the effect of the Ten-Year Bazooka runs out. Lambo is in danger when he turns back into his original form. Tsuna steps in to save Lambo, but he’s disqualified for interfering. Both the lightning and sky rings are taken away. Tsuna is regretful, but Reborn acknowledges that he took action to save a friend. Tsuna wants to become stronger so his friends don`t get hurt. Yamamoto smiles at him for his determination, but Gokudera looks gloomy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
