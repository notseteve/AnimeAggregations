  "description" : "What with the girls in her class despising her, and yet another old friend of Arima`s, Shibahime Tsubasa, giving her the evil eye as well, Yukino is hemmed in on all sides. With no intention of giving into these assaults, however, she instead spends carefree days with Arima and Asaba. She even turns aside Shibahime`s escalating attacks as if they were mere jokes. Hearing all of this, Tsubaki, a friend of Shibahime`s, joins Aya and Rika in declaring their friendship for Yukino, thus abruptly drawing her into their group.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
