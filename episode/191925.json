  "description" : "The time has finally come for the showdown between Hideyoshi and Nobunaga. Fighting alongside Hideyoshi are the Takeda and Sanada Armies while the Uesugi and Date Armies join Nobunaga`s side. At one end of the battle, Shingen faces off with his mortal enemy, Kenshin Uesugi, and, at the other, Hideyoshi rushes headlong into the burning forest by himself seeking his one chance to try and take Nobunaga`s head. Just as a victor in the battle seems about to be determined a large number of yakuma appear and the battlefield descends into utter chaos.\nSource: crunchyroll",
