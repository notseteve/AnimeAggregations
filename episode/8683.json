  "description" : "At school, the bank incident causes Kiyo to become popular with the students. On the way home, Kiyo and Zatch are attacked by Hosokawa and Reycom. Hosokawa reveals that he wants to use Zatch`s powers for his own gain. In the midst of the battle, Kiyo is frozen to the ground. Hosokawa takes Kiyo`s book but is unable to read it. Hosokawa grabs Zatch and attempts to fire a \"Zaker\" at Kiyo but nothing occurs. Kiyo realizes that only the people chosen to read the book are able to cast the spells. Zatch manages to retrieve the book and return it to Kiyo. Kiyo reads the second spell \"Rashield\" which summons an electric shield from the ground. The shield catches Reycom`s icicles and reflects it back with the addition of lightning on the icicles towards him. One of the reflected ice shards comes in contact with Reycom`s book causing it to burn. When the book is burned into ashes, Reycom disappears along with it.",
