  "description" : "Lolly and Menoly are jealous that Aizen is treating Orihime well, so they go to Orihime`s room to harass her. Orihime tries to stay strong, but they are relentless. At that moment, Grimmjow comes to Orihime`s room. Meanwhile, Uryu comes to help Renji, and joins the fight against Szayel Aporro. Uryu takes advantage of an opening and pierces Szayel Aporro with Seeleschneider`s blade. Szayel Aporro collapses, but Uryu is shocked when Seeleschneider suddenly disappears.\nSource: crunchyroll",
