  "description" : "Ichigo, Uryu, Chad, Rukia, and Renji go their separate ways down the corridors of Las Noches and vow to safely reunite. Ichigo heads down a pathway on his own, but he is followed by Nel. He has no choice but to allow her to join him in order to keep her safe. Suddenly, he senses someone`s Spiritual Pressure. An Arrancar named Dordoni stands in Ichigo and Nel`s way. Dordoni is Espada Number 103 and doesn`t appear to be very strong. Ichigo unenthusiastically accepts his challenge.\nSource: crunchyroll",
