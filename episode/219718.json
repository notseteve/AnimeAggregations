  "description" : "The girl who stood in the party’s way announced herself as “Amante, Betrayer of Mothers”, and told them that she belonged to the rebel group \"Ribele\". She also told them that she’d gotten the adventurers in town to join her party and help her clear the dungeon. She told them all this despite the fact that they hadn’t asked her any of it. The party decided that it needed lots of help to free the adventurers from Amante, and retreated. They opened the “With Mommy” guild, and began to recruit. But Amante’s helper, Pocchi, came to stop them. He and his buddies made a certain demand of Mamako, and told her that if she didn’t do what they wanted,  they’d use bombs to blow up the city!\nSource: crunchyroll",
