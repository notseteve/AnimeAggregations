  "description" : "When Azuma sees the Buranki approaching the train that`s transporting Oubu, he recognizes it as the headless Buranki that attacked his family on Treasure Island ten years ago. Frozen in place, it seems Azuma is about to be trampled underfoot, but Kinoa saves him in the nick of time with Hoemaru and Himekiri. The relieved Kogane joins them along with Hiiragi and Shizuru, when the four Bubuki come together, the heart in Azuma`s hand radiates an intense light in concert with a shining beam emitted by the skeleton of Oubu.\nSource: crunchyroll",
