  "description" : "Eiko gets presents from her classmates on her birthday, but they all turn out to be hairpins. Being a good friend, Eiko puts them all on, resulting in a head full of hairpins and the new nickname \"Pinko\" bestowed upon her by their teacher, Ms. Enami. On the walk home from school, Eiko is back to wearing just her normal mature-looking hairpin, which becomes the subject of a discussion. A curious Tamate asks where she bought the hairpin, but Eiko only gives an enigmatic smile and says it`s a secret.\nSource: crunchyroll",
