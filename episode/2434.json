  "description" : "It`s the first day of planning for the Culture Fair. Yukino`s class tries to decide what they want to do while Asaba informs them of what his class is doing: a Asaba Hideki Dinner Show. A new transfer student arrives named Tonami Takefumi. When Rika hears the name she remembers a boy with the same name from 7th grade but figures it`s just a coincidence that they have the exact same name. Aya finally finishes whatever she was writing from the day before saying that it was a screenplay. She wrote it out hoping that Yukino, Maho, and Tsubasa would perform it since they have nothing to do during the Culture Fair.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
