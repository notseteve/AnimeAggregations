  "description" : "Moments after Mayuri`s death, Suzuha rushes in the lab and creates a distraction, allowing Kurisu to use the time leap machine to send Rintaro back in time to 5pm the same day. Rintaro drives everyone out of the lab before frantically searching for Mayuri, during which he receives a call from Kurisu, who deduces that he made a time leap. Finding Mayuri, Rintaro attempts to flee with her to the station, only for the trains to have stopped. When they are both approached by Rounders, they attempt to flee, but Mayuri is once again killed when she is run over by Moeka`s car. Escaping the Rounders` clutches and performing another time leap, Rintaro locates Mayuri earlier and escapes to the subway station. However, Mayuri is killed once again when Yuugo`s daughter, Nae, accidentally pushes her in the path of an oncoming train. Devastated, Rintaro vows to keep leaping to the past until he manages to save Mayuri.\nSource: Wikipedia",
