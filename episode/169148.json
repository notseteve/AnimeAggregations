  "description" : "Kagami runs across a first-year student named Kuramochi Madoka, who seems to have the ability to assess the value of any person or organisation, handing down the budgets for the school clubs with Makina. Later that day, in Akihabara, Kagami buys a new game with money he saved from skipping lunch, and runs across her again, and she declares that she wants him. She chases him across the district, and he later saves her from a group of students unhappy that she cut the budget of their club, but breaks the disc of his new game as a result. It turns out that Kuramochi`s family business is the company that made that game. He continues to rebuff her advances.\nKuramochi unexpectedly shows up at his house in a gift box and wearing a maid uniform, declaring that she will marry him, much to Suzune`s displeasure. Kagami does some research and finds out that Kuramochi`s company is the target of a hostile takeover by a much larger American game company. She tells him that one of the conditions is that she must marry the CEO of the company or else most of the employees of her company will be dismissed after the merger.",
