  "description" : "Kikyo and his comrades planned to surround the Vongola and attack from three corners, but when he hears an explosion from somewhere in the forest, he stops advancing for the moment. Kikyo says the battle has begun, but he looks pretty confident as he gazes in the direction of the explosion. He thinks the Vongola will have no chance of winning once Zakuro starts fighting for real. Gokudera is extremely worn out from fighting, but then he sees Zakuro in action and is absolutely astonished by Zakuro’s power. Gokudera has strengthened his resolve up until now, but will he be able to come through in this battle?\nSource: crunchyroll",
