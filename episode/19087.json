  "description" : "A month and a half after Koshiro has moved out, both the siblings are still thinking of each other, but keeping their promise not to see each other again. Nanoka sometimes walks by his new apartment or place of work, but avoids meeting him. Kaname has taken to sleeping over at Koshiro`s place because \"it`s closer to work\". One day when they are going to his place, they see Nanoka outside. He pushes Kaname away to hide from Nanoka, and Kaname guesses why he left home and is hiding from Nanoka. She confronts him, accuses him of perversion, and walks away. He stays home from work. When he opens the door to go to the store, Nanoka is standing there.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
