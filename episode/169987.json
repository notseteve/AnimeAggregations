  "description" : "Kyoutarou finally decides to come to school, and despite being a boy manages to displace Kanan as the cutest girl in school, attracting attention even after he is known to be a boy. This initially makes Kanan jealous but is mollified after Kyoutarou says he admires her style and looks up to her like an elder sister. They go around looking for cute things when Kyoutarou sees a poster for a one-day part-time job as a shrine maiden during a festival, and he convinces Makina to let them do so as an exception to the school rules prohibiting any part-time work. Makina joins as well, ostensibly to make sure they don`t cause trouble. They are assigned to sell lucky charms at a booth in the shrine, and Kyoutarou attracts more attention than Kanan or Makina. Makina is concerned that if Kagami sees her dressed as a shrine maiden he will tease her with another silly nickname like `miko miko twintail`. She is almost caught when Kagami and his sister visit the shrine to buy a charm for academic success.\nThe next day after school Kyoutarou calls on Kagami and they go to a video game arcade and play a game together. Kagami gives the charm to him, and he says he went out to school so they could be partners in real life like they were in the game.",
