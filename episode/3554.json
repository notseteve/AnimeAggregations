  "description" : "One day, Sakura came home after grocery shopping to find Yukito cutting Toya`s hair, so she asked him to give her a trip as well. I noticed right away when I saw her the next day, but Chiharu and Meiling said they saw Sakura causing trouble at the local stores. After seeing her double later that day, she realized that it must be a Clow Card! Kero taught Sakura how to read fortunes using the Clow Cards, and Sakura discovered that Toya was in danger. The fake Sakura lured Toya out into the woods, where he fell off a cliff! Sakura and Kero ran into Xiaolang in the woods while looking for Toya, and he helped them find Toya and the Clow Card. After her usual methods of capturing cards failed, Kero told Sakura that the only way to capture special cards is to call them by name. Since Sakura is so wonderful, she realized it was the Mirror card and sealed it away! She then vowed to collect all of the other cards so that they can`t harm anyone else.\nSource: crunchyroll",
