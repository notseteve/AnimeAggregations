  "description" : "The pendant Shuraiya receives from Utau begins to change his personality. Pearl, Shuraiya`s servant since childhood, finds Ramira suffering because of the pendant`s dark energy. She brings him to the Guardians and tells them that she has been able to see Ramira. Ramira informs the guardians about what happened the night before. Meanwhile, Shuraiya extracts Saaya and her followers` eggs, which become X Characters. When the Guardians arrive, their Guardian Characters are captured and Ramira is turned into an X Egg. Pearl protects Ramira`s egg to keep from turning into an X Character and explains to Shuraiya that his father cares for him deeply. Pearl`s strong feelings give birth to her own Guardian Character who frees the other Guardian Characters. Amu and Rima transform and purify the X Characters and Ramira. Shuraiya apologizes to Pearl for his action and decides to return home and reconcile with his father.\nSource: crunchyroll",
