  "description" : "Maki challenges Julietta to a fight. The appointed time is three o`clock and that`s when she wakes up. \"I overslept!\" said Maki. However, the man who arrived at the appointed place on time was Maki`s father, \"Shiro Saeki\". Without Maki`s presence, Shiro challenges Julietta to a fight, but to Julietta, Shiro was not the one he was eagerly waiting for. Julietta begins to plant a sequence of kicks that were filled with fury. As Maki proceeds as quickly as possible to the appointed place, she is stopped on route and challenged to another fight by a girl named Miori Saeki. The girl is in fact Maki`s half-sister who has a similar passion for battle. Maki, who is seriously in a hurry, arrives at the appointed place by quickly throwing off Miori. Miori then follow Maki to the appointed place to witness the unexpected defeat of their father. Finally, the full-out battle of Maki and Julietta begins!\nSource: crunchyroll",
