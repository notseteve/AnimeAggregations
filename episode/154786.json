  "description" : "The scrim continues. Sawamura has finally based. It was thanks to the advice from Haruichi Kominato. As he steps into the batter`s box, he declares to score a run. His batting turns out to be amazing. To answer the call, Sawamura sprints and makes it back to the plate. The first-year team gains momentum, but the Head Coach is ending the game mid way. However, he will let the game continue if the entire first-year team wants to keep playing. How will they respond?\nSource: crunchyroll",
