  "description" : "While Suzuka is sitting in front of the shrine, it is revealed to us exactly how Kazuki dies. Eventually, Honoka finds her in front of her shrine, and sits down to talk to her. Honoka ends up yelling at Suzuka, because Suzuka refuses to accept Yamato, afraid to get in a relationship. Suzuka tells her that she doesn`t know how it feels to lose a loved one, which Honoka counters by telling her that she doesn`t know how it feels to have your loved one stolen from you. Eventually, Suzuka runs away, and Yamato comes to the shrine. Honoka, feeling defeated, tells Yamato where Suzuka is. When Yamato gets there, he argues with Suzuka a bit more, eventually forcing a kiss on her. Afterwards she slapped him several times.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
