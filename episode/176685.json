  "description" : "After saving Banagher and the Unicorn Gundam, which were falling toward Earth, the Garencieres crash-lands in the Western Sahara. Meanwhile, Zeon remnants who have been hiding on Earth launch a diversionary attack on the Earth Federation capital at Dakar. Ronan, a Federation government official, orders Bright Noa to hunt down the Garencieres. Having descended to Earth with Riddhe, Mineva flees the Marcenas household out of fear that she will be used for political purposes. But the words of an old Earth-born man, who speaks of the good intentions of those who carried out the settlement of space, help her realize what she should do, and she turns herself in to her pursuers. At the same time, Alberto`s aunt Martha is reconditioning the Cyber-Newtype Marida so that she can be controlled. And Zinnerman decides to cross the desert to make contact with the Zeon remnants, taking Banagher with him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
