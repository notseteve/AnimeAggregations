  "description" : "Sakaki explains further about Lenka`s predicament, stating that if he stops using his God Arc he will probably be able to live for about another three years as the damage has progressed so far, but if he uses it that will shorten his life rapidly. Lenka asks Sakaki to fix his God Arc anyway, and also to keep his condition a secret from everyone else.\nLater, the operations for the beginning of Meteorite are explained. Teams of God Eaters are to bring the beacons that attract Aragami into place, and keep them safe from the Aragami. Lenka is chosen to be the leader of one team, with Soma under him. He hears disquieting rumours about Soma, that he is some sort of \"death god\" as everyone close to him seems to die, so he investigates Soma, and learns that he is actually the son of Johannes von Schicksal, and is apparently the first God Eater.\nDuring the operation, they drop the beacon from a helicopter and it is promptly attacked by Aragami, who push against the protective field and may destroy it. Soma drops down to attack, and uses a powerful energy blast attack that destroys many Aragami. He is pressed as there are too many of them, until Lenka goes down himself shielding the beacon with his God Arc, allowing Soma to destroy the last of the Aragami that stood between him and the beacon without destroying it as well.",
