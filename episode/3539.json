  "description" : "A bunch of us decided to go to the summer festival at Tsukimine Shrine, and while we were there I saw a chance to give Sakura and Yukito a little time alone. As they were walking around together, they accidentally wound up behind the shrine, where they saw hundreds of tiny lights floating around like fireflies. The mood started to turn romantic, but it was ruined when Xiaolang and Toya showed up. Sakura suspected the lights might be the doing of a Clow Card, so she called out her staff and discovered that she was right- the lights were actually the Glow card! Sakura captured the card, but she`ll always be grateful to it for creating an air of romance for her and Yukito.\nSource: crunchyroll",
