  "description" : "Paper clones of Ragyo and Nui appear before Ryuko, coaxing her into travelling to Honnouji Academy to confront them. Unwilling to help anyone, Ryuko heads off alone. After hacking into Honnouji`s security cameras and finding Satsuki`s location, Ryuko`s allies find out from Satsuki`s actions that she is planning something. With renewed resolve, they set forth on Aikuro`s Naked Sol warship and head towards Honnouji Academy to join the fight. Ryuko arrives and takes on Nui, who is also revealed to have a Life Fiber body. Ragyo ensnares Ryuko and forces her to wear Junketsu, starting to rewrite her memories. Meanwhile, Satsuki escapes from her confinement and rejoins Nudist Beach on the Sol. As Ryuko, now clad in Junketsu, arrives on the ship to attack, Satsuki dons Senketsu and confronts Ryuko.",
