  "description" : "Kusakabe Yuki overhears some girls saying mean things about her. Gossip is not an uncommon problem among high school girls, but Yuki is particularly worried that it`s happening because she`s a demi. Tetsuo is sympathetic to thr concern and makes up his mind that, as her teacher, he must protect her. Hikari, a fellow demi, feels the same way.\nSource: crunchyroll",
