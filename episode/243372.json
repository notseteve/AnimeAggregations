  "description" : "Rimuru backs Clayman into a corner trying to get him to reveal who he`s working for, but even on death`s door, Clayman`s lips are sealed. Left with no other choice, Rimuru finishes Clayman off. With Clayman dead and Carrion and Frey announcing that they`re stepping down as Demon Lords, the total number of Demon Lords including Rimuru is reduced from ten to eight. Guy coerces Rimuru into coming up with a new name for their group, and Rimuru`s solution is \"Octagram,\" representing each of the Demon Lords as an eight-pointed star. Thus a slime became one of the eight Demon Lords, marking the start of a new age.\nSource: crunchyroll",
