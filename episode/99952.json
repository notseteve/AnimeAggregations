  "description" : "Tsuna flies through Melone Base with a single goal: find Shoichi Irie and the white, round device in his laboratory! Irie tries to interfere with Tsuna`s movements from afar by moving Melone Base`s blocks. With Spanner behind him, Tsuna cannot shake off a homing missile, but he is able to fend it off with chaff and flame shots that Spanner modified. Even seeing this, Irie smiles fearlessly… What final block awaits Tsuna?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
