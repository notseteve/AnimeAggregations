  "description" : "Bat is now a brave young man, and Lin has grown into a beautiful woman. Together, they found the North Star Army, to save the people suffering under Jakoh and the Celestial Emperor`s tyranny. But leading an army of greenhorns turns out to be an uphill battle fraught with peril. They continue to await the return of Kenshiro, the savior of legend. Rumors spread far that Ken is dead. Meanwhile, in a poor, squalid village, a \"drifter\" appears, looking haggard. That drifter is saved by a young boy named Haru, who hasn`t lost his sense of justice or compassion even when living in a poor village.\nSource: crunchyroll",
