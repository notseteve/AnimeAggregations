  "description" : "Alisa comes to visit, and she doesn`t understand why Fuyuki`s upset.  Keroro explains that it`s because his mother is busy with work and can`t go on the picnic she`d planned with them.  Alisa takes it upon herself to \"motivate\" the slacker mangaka who`s taking up all her time and terrify the man back on track.  Maybe not the best thing for Fuyuki`s mother!\nSource: crunchyroll",
