  "description" : "Something odd is happening - vampires seem to be growing in number. And when an Italian college student is found to have a computer chip, which has apparently made him into an `artificial` vampire, it raises more than a few eyebrows. Even though the chip is removed, the student revives, killing many on his search for his lover, who he was caught in the act of making one of his own. Hellsing moves to put a stop to this, but there seems to be more than one person interested in the boy.",
