  "description" : "A few girls from my class decided to go into the woods behind school to investigate he rumor about ghost sightings in the area. But instead of a ghost, an image of Sakura`s late mother appeared! In her scramble to chase after the vision, Sakura fell off a cliff. But then Yukito came to the rescue! Sakura, Kero and I went back to the area again later, and that`s when Sakura discovered that her mother`s image was just a vision conjured up by the Illusion card! Yukito right- the real ghost of her mother would never do anything to hurt her. Sakura had to force herself to ignore the spirit`s resemblance t her beloved mother. She simply gritted her teeth and sealed the troublesome card away.\nSource: crunchyroll",
