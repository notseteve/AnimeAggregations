  "description" : "Fake news spells real danger for Ryo!\nIn a story that could have been inspired by today`s headlines, City Hunter Ryo Saeba is hired as the bodyguard to Mega City TV’s popular newscaster, Sayaka Asagiri, who’s been targeted for murder by newly-made executive madman Mad Dog and his minions. But Mad Dog also has mad tech skills, which he uses to alter video footage of Ryo and his client. Soon, the top story in the news is about kidnapper Ryo Saeba and his abducted victim, Sayaka! While Ryo and Sayaka are on the run from the police, a fake-newsmaking media and an army of Mad Dog’s hired guns, a ticked-off Kaori goes straight to the source, Mega City TV, to confront whoever’s in charge about framing her partner on national TV, but quickly gets in over her head!\nSource: crunchyroll",
