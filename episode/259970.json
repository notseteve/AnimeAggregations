  "description" : "Teshima and Aoyagi win their sprint race against Kyoto Fushimi and rejoin their team. Sakamichi enjoys racing with all six of his team members, but it doesn’t last long. Aoyagi’s legs, which have been pulling the team with all their might in order to catch up to Hakone Academy, have been in pain since the previous day and are nearing their limit. Kaburagi can’t hold back his tears as he watches the upperclassman’s back. By taking on Aoyagi’s hopes and racing for the team, Kaburagi experiences great personal growth of his own.\nSource: crunchyroll",
