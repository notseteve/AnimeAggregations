  "description" : "One day, Mana goes with her mother, Junko, to visit her great-aunt, Yoshiko, in the hospital. Her great-aunt asks her to see if the flowers around her house are blooming. When she arrives at her great-aunt`s house, Mana is surprised by the spectacle before her. Bright red flowers bloom proudly not just in the garden, but on the roof and the walls, too. She takes a picture of the incredible flowers and sends it to Cat-girl. While Mana is listening to stories from her mother about her great-aunt when she was young, Kitaro and the others arrive. Daddy Eyeball says the flowers are youka, bewitched flowers, and that they bloom by drinking in yokai energy or spirit energy. Wanting to know why the yoka are blooming at her great-aunt`s house, Mana goes with Kitaro and the others to the place the flowers come from, an island in the south.\nSource: crunchyroll",
