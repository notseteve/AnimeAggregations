  "description" : "Sakura was so happy when her father gave her mother`s old calendar! After seeing all the dates her mother wrote down, Sakura realized that it was her great grandfather`s birthday. She was sad to find out that he didn`t like her father, and decided to show him how happy they all were together! Sakura put together a really thoughtful present for her great grandfather, just like her mother used to do. She made a handmade gift, and added pink flowers with the Flower card, and even wrote her great grandfather a beautiful letter so he`d know they were all happy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
