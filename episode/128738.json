  "description" : "Sink Izumi makes a promise with his best friend Rebecca to go flower viewing during the last three days of Spring Break. However, while he is alone trying out some acrobatic moves in school, a dog appears and opens a magical portal while Sink is in mid-air, resulting in him jumping through the portal with the dog. He arrives in the land of Flonyard, and is greeted by a beautiful girl, albeit with bestial features like dog ears and tail. The girl, who introduces herself as Princess Millhiore, requests for his assistance, which he agrees to and becomes the Princess` Hero, in order to drive away the forces of Galette which seeks to invade Biscotti.\nSource: crunchyroll",
