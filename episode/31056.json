  "description" : "Eventually, Jiro becomes Melmo`s boy friend. Jiro tells Melmo that he has some knowledge of karate and that he has become physically strong thanks to the master of the dojo he used to learn from. Growing interested in karate Melmo visits the dojo. There she finds the grand master, named Yanagida, who looks tough as can be. But at home things are different, and he feels small surrounded by all women in the family. Yanagida has been praying fervently that his pregnant wife would finally give birth to a baby boy. Professor Waregarasu explains to Melmo the mechanism of pregnancy, and tells her that it is impossible to select the gender. Melmo starts to imagine what kind of a baby she would give birth to. \nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
