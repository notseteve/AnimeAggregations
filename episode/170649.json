  "description" : "Both of the New Type God Eaters at the disposal of the Far East Branch of Fenrir are out of action, Alisa suffering from severe psychological trauma, and Lenka`s God Arc is broken. While Lindow is sent on a solo mission, Sakuya leads the 1st unit along with the 2nd to hunt more Aragami. The mission quickly goes bad as the ground collapses beneath their feet into a tunnel complex, and they are in dire straits as Aragami attack them from above. Tsubaki insists that they attempt to get aboveground, but Lenka says that would be suicide, and that they should instead go through the tunnel complex and find another exit. Sakuya listens to Lenka`s advice and manages to destroy the Aragami in a pincer move.\nJohannes explains about Meteorite, their new strategy for defeating the Aragami, which involves using special devices that are capable of attracting them and separating them by species so they can be more easily destroyed.\nThe chief scientist of Fenrir, Paylor Sakaki, personally examines Lenka`s God Arc and realises it has broken because Lenka`s compatibility rate with it is too high. He also determines that this also means that Lenka will die soon as it is too much for him to handle.",
