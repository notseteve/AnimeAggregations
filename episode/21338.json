  "description" : "Kiyo and Zatch think of ways to get stronger until they are interrupted by Kido and his book keeper Dr. Riddles, who challenges Kiyo and Zatch to a battle. He reveals that the Majestic Twelve will be the one to fight him. Dr. Riddles then asks Kiyo to solve a riddle. After he answers correctly, Dr. Riddles and the Majestic Twelve leave. Dr. Riddles returns later and challenges Kiyo to a Mamodo battle. He reveals that if Kiyo defeats him, he will reveal the secret of the book. Kiyo and Zatch are at the disadvantage against Dr. Riddles. Dr. Riddles gives Kiyo a hint about the books and Kiyo realizes the truth about the books; the spells in the books are actually manifestations of the Mamodo`s power. Kiyo tells Zatch to believe in the power that is inside him. At that moment, the book glows and Kiyo uses the sixth spell, \"Rauzaruk\".",
