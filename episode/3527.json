  "description" : "Sakura was still pretty tired from changing more cards into Sakura Cards, and had a hard time staying awake in class. Meanwhile, Yukito was starting to get concerned about how tired he was and how much he had been blacking out. It turned out that his issues were because Yue`s power was running out. If Yue were to run out of power, then both of them would disappear. Toya noticed something wrong with Yukito, and wanted to help, but Nakuru got in his way. When we went to Penguin Park that night, Sakura felt Clow Reed`s presence again, and we found a huge pit! After hopping in it, Sakura said she got covered in sheep, but she managed to escape and close it up!\nSource: crunchyroll",
