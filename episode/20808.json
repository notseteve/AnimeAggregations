  "description" : "Laura`s family goes to the beach, but they can`t take Hamtaro, because hamsters are afraid of water. Hamtaro, along with the other Ham-Hams, go to the beach anyway, by hiding inside the family car. Later on, a storm breaks while Laura and Kana are away from the main beach. The Ham-Hams use Laura`s hat to get her father`s attention and successfully lead him to the girls. \nSource: Wikipedia",
