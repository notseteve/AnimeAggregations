  "description" : "Makoto, Kei, Chinatsu, and Nao go herb picking in the mountains. Chinatsu enjoys picking the herbs but not eating them. However, Akane told her that she can`t be a good witch if she`s picky with food. She makes an effort to eat some herbs, but they are too bitter for her. To help relieve the bitterness, Akane suggests paying a visit to a nearby cafe to grab a slice of cake.\nSource: crunchyroll",
