  "description" : "To prepare them for the mission, Riko brings Aria and Kinji to a maid café, where she explains that her treasure, a rosary which is a keepsake from her late mother, is being kept by Vlad. The plan is for Aria and Kinji to infiltrate Vlad`s villa in Yokohama disguised as a maid and butler.\nKinji is made to go to one of the infirmaries but on the way he sees Jeanne playing the piano. She was evidently also given a plea bargain and explains about how Vlad is some sort of inhuman monster who has lived for centuries, and that both her ancestors and Riko`s planned his overthrow over a century ago and failed, and how Riko wants to be free of Vlad after having suffered under his heel most of her life.\nKinji arrives at the infirmary right on time and a group of female students has been made to take a physical exam, so he hides in a locker where Mutou has already positioned himself to spy on the girls. The girls include Reki, Aria, and Riko and it is evident to Kinji that her plan was to train him in achieving Hysteria Mode. It is soon obvious that Aria is able to most easily excite Hysteria Mode in him for some reason. The two boys are exposed just as a white wolf attacks them under Vlad`s orders, but Kinji and Reki manage to subdue the wolf after chasing it through the school.",
