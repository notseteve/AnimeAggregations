  "description" : "Although Yamamoto won against the first generation Rain Guardian, Asari Ugetsu, he ended up being disqualified. Yamamoto is shocked. The rest of the crew doesn’t understand why he was disqualified, though Asari Ugetsu says that Tsuna should know why. Tsuna thinks about it but can’t quite figure it out. Yamamoto is hard on himself and becomes even more depressed. Then, Colonnello says that Yamamoto must solve this problem himself or it will have been for naught.\nSource: crunchyroll",
