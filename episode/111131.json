  "description" : "On a very hot day, the Master comes up with a plan to prepare cold noodles. The staff at \"hako-bune\" tries to recreate the amazing cold noodles that Arashi had tried once when she was young. The girls struggle in making the noodles since Kanako and Yayoi have never tried cold noodles, and Arashi does not know the exact recipe either. When it was left up to Kaya, she ended up making noodles topped with shaved ice. On the other hand, Arashi ends up creating a Neapolitan. It takes a turn for the worse when they start running the noodles in the rain gutter.\nSource: crunchyroll",
