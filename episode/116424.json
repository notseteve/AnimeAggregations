  "description" : "Following Muramasa`s defeat, most of the Zanpakuto have reconciled and returned to their masters, except for Kazeshini, who is still out to kill his former master Shuhei Hisagi. When Kazeshini goes into the Rukon District in the hopes of finding Shuhei, he instead comes across an infant who just lost his father to a Sword Beast. To Kazeshini`s annoyance, the infant has taken a liking to the rogue Zanpakuto and now refuses to leave his side.\nSource: crunchyroll",
