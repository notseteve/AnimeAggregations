  "description" : "Scriptwriter Yasue is found dead in her apartment hanging from a noose. Shibakaru, Sakaba, and Hamanaka all testify she was already dead when they visited her apartment during the presumed time of her death, and Megure believes she may have killed herself. Near the body are scattered 500 thousand yen and roughly a hundred pages of manuscript paper, but Megure determines they would not have been enough to stand on. After questioning, Conan uses his smart phone to investigate the three year old case of a group of thieves who murdered a couple and stole two million yen and learns the name of Yasue`s young friend is Ganno Mamoru. Conan has already arrived at the truth of the situation.\nSource: crunchyroll",
