  "description" : "Akiho tries to get her father, Senomiya Ken`ichirou, who is the president of the Tanegashima Space Center, to fund their giant robot project, but her mother soon quashes that line of thought. Later, Kaito is called to meet with Frau Koujiro, whose real name is Furugoori Kona, to help her move into her dorm as a transfer into his school. Following more intel from Mizuka, Akiho goes to see Mitsuhiko`s uncle, who runs a candy factory, to request sponsorship for their robot. Meanwhile, Subaru manages to get Kaito`s assistance for an upcoming Robo-One tournament in Las Vegas. As Subaru questions about what Kaito did during the tournament, Kaito recalls an incident on September 11, 2010, in which he and Akiho were part of a mass fainting aboard a ferry, where they both acquired inverse variations of the same syndrome. Later that night, Kaito hears a strange voice coming from his Poke-Com, as a girl appears when seen through its AR interface. \nSource: Wikipedia",
