  "description" : "While Yoko visits Wa State, the Rike in Ei State is raided.  Rangyoku is killed; Enho is kidnapped; Kei-Kei is wounded and taken to Kimba Palace.  Yoko investigates Ro, the man who visited Enho before, but he’s gone.  Shokei is asked to sell Toki’s to make money to hire soldiers while Suzu is asked to buy Tokis.  They meet and realize they share the same purpose, except that Shokei corrects Suzu’s misconception about Kei-o.  Kosho’s group suspects Yoko probing for information, and they move to a different hotel.  Yoko gets suspicious of them for kidnapping of Enho, but after Kosho’s explanation, Yoko joins his group for rebellion.\nSource: crunchyroll",
