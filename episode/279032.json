  "description" : "Kagaya`s Kasugai Crow suddenly appears in front of Tamayo and invites her to the Demon Slayer headquarters — even though she is a demon. Meanwhile, after receiving a letter from Kagaya at the Butterfly Mansion, Tanjiro pays a visit to Giyu, who is not participating in the Hashira Training. At first, Tanjiro is rejected by Giyu but patiently continues to try to talk to him. Giyu, who gives in to Tanjiro`s persistence, begins to share the reason why he won`t participate in the training.\nSource: crunchyroll",
