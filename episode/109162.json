  "description" : "Yuuto is asked by Nobunaga to work in place of him at the special sales exhibition of “Nocturne Girls’ School Lacrosse Club”. Originally, Nobunaga was asked by his friend to work for them, but he says he has prior plans and can’t do it. Not knowing what to do, Yuuto asks Haruka for help, and she is super excited to experience the circle activity for the first time. On top of that, she learns that she is allowed to sell her own works too, and attempts to make her original anthology book. With the finished original doujinshi in hand, Yuuto and Haruka head to the event, but will the “artistic” illustration anthology book attract many buyers??\nSource: crunchyroll",
