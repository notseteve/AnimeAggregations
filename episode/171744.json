  "description" : "A man has suddenly awoken in the middle of a snow-covered land, chased by an insect-like monster of some sort. It chases after him but he is saved by a young woman with animal ears and a tail, who introduces herself as Kuon. He has no memory of anything, not even of his own name. After a gruelling journey through the forests and mountains they reach a small village, where Kuon gives him the name Haku, after a figure of legend. After recuperating from his injuries, Haku is made to do menial work at the village in order to earn his keep, but he is singularly unsuitable for this as he is physically weak. He appears to have a clever mind however and manages to repair the village`s mill, whose waterwheel had long been broken. He meets Ukon, who appears to be an important person in the village.",
