Seemingly drawn by its power, Suzume reaches for the knob… Doors begin to open one after another all across Japan, unleashing destruction upon any who are near. Suzume must close these portals to prevent further disaster.\n—The stars, then sunset, and the morning sky.\nWithin that realm, it was as though all time had melted together in the sky…\nNever-before-seen scenery, encounters and farewells… A myriad of challenges await her on her journey. Despite all the obstacles in her way, Suzume’s adventure shines a ray of hope upon our own struggles against the toughest roads of anxiety and constraints that make up everyday life. This story of closing doors that connect our past to the present and future will leave a lasting impression upon all of our hearts.\nDrawn in by these mysterious doors, Suzume’s journey is about to begin.\nSource: crunchyroll",
