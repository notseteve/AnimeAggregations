  "description" : "It has been some time but apparently the Ale meteor shower is still going on. This concerns the Archduke so he sends Oasis on a new quest to investigate the phenomenon. They are asked to visit the forest home of Mise Altoise, Agnes`s teacher for possible clues. Agnes is familiar with the area and knows how to get through the maze of magical traps her teacher had set, but notices that they have been changed in subtle ways, so she expects Mise to be there, and is disappointed to find that she is not there. Oasis searches the house and finds a note for Agnes hidden in a secret compartment. Meanwhile, Nick, standing guard outside the house is attacked by a girl who proves to have exceptional fighting ability. The girl is recognised by Agnes, who calls her Avril, and she is shocked to see her. Avril`s partner, Aberdeen Roland, appears, also much to Agnes`s shock, as they were both apprentices with Mise in the past. He says that his goal is to obtain Minette`s core, and they have a fight with Oasis, but he decides to withdraw after the fight does not seem to progress.",
