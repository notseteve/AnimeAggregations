  "description" : "The tense practice game against Seiho is tied at 0. Sawamura gets into trouble in the top of the sixth inning, but an incredible throw to home by center fielder Aso pulls the team through. In the bottom of the same inning, lead-off batter Yuki’s hit arcs high. How far will it go? Meanwhile, Sawamura is feeling the weight of his responsibility to the coach and his team and continues spiraling down. His dogged determination is obvious to not only the nine fielders, or the players on the bench, but even to the fans in the stands.\nSource: crunchyroll",
