  "description" : "When it comes to studiousness, Shirogane is second to none, but as for athletics, he`s hopeless, which is why he`s training hard for volleyball in the gym after school. However, no matter what he does, Shirogane isn`t showing any signs of progress. Playing volleyball for P.E. is only a week away, and at this rate, his image as the perfect president of Student Council will be crushed. Just as Shirogane gives in to despair, Fujiwara shows up. Swallowing his pride, he begs her to coach him, and so Shirogane`s days of training under the enthusiastic tutelage of Fujiwara begin. Will he be able to deliver an average serve in time?\nSource: crunchyroll",
