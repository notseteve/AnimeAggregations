  "description" : "Mana`s friend Miyabi has quarreled with her mother over something trivial. When she wishes she could go back to when she was little, she suddenly finds herself lost in a forest. There live mysterious children, forest spirits, the Kinoko. They invite Miyabi to play, and Miyabi innocently joins them. In the Kinoko forest, there are no adults, no school. It`s a world with nothing to tie her down. Miyabi begins to wish she never had to leave. But, slowly, Miyabi`s mind and body mature while the Kinoko around her stay the same, leaving her baffled. That`s when Kitaro appears after receiving a request from Mana. Will Miyabi return to her old world, or will she stay in the forest?\nSource: crunchyroll",
