  "description" : "The Odd Jobs gang has gone to the mountains to go hunting for matsutake mushrooms. Gintoki is in high spirits, but a hunter named Marinosuke appears before him and warns him to leave the mountain quickly because it`s dangerous. But Gintoki and the others don`t listen and are intent on finding matsutake mushrooms. Masamune, a giant bear that`s being controlled by a space mushroom, appears before the group! Gintoki and the others escape thanks to Marinosuke. They try to fight Masamune to collect a reward. But a mushroom just like the one controlling Masamune is growing out of Gintoki`s head!!\nSource: crunchyroll",
