  "description" : "One day in winter, as Christmas approaches, Mayuki wonders if the Hitotose girls can`t put on some kind of event to draw customers to the coffee shop. Chiaki suggests that the troupe put on another play on Christmas Eve, and the girls quickly grow excited for their second public performance. Many ideas are shared, but they decide that since it`ll be taking place on Christmas Eve, their play should be a Christmas story... and with that, the preparations begin.\nSource: crunchyroll",
