  "description" : "Promoter Yayoi Konno tells Miss Monochrome, the active idol and a part-time convenience store worker, that it`s time for them to reserve venues for her live tour and asks if she has any requests. Miss Monochrome throws out exaggerated dreams like \"All the famous domes and halls in the country\" and \"150,000 small venues\" as a joke. Incredibly, Yayoi shows how skilled she is by jumping into her car, driving all over with her engine roaring, and actually reserving them all. Next, Miss Monochrome and Maneo meet with Yayoi in the convenience store office and begin their live performance-centered meeting.\nSource: crunchyroll",
