  "description" : "Shirayuki has showed up at Kinji`s door, enraged that he is living with Aria. She breaks down his door and fights with Aria, trashing his apartment before he can calm them down. She makes several attempts to kill Aria later as well, seeing her as a thieving cat who has stolen Kinji from her. Kinji explains how Shirayuki is a Butei with supernatural powers that come from her training as a shrine maiden. They later learn that she is being targeted by someone called `Durandal`, who seems to have been responsible for some of the crimes Aria`s mother was accused of. They volunteer to be Shirayuki`s bodyguards. Life with Aria and Shirayuki is less than peaceful.",
