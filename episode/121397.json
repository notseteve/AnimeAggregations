  "description" : "Erza`s back and she`s ready to end the Battle of Fairy Tail once and for all! Facing off against Evergreen, Erza knows that if she takes this Raijin Tribe member out, the rest of the stone statue hostages will return to normal, and that means Game Over for Laxus!  But things don`t go as simply as planned, for Laxus has a backup plan up his sleeve... Above Magnolia are floating countless number of thunder lacrima, primed and charged to rain lightning down on the innocent people below. They`re Laxus`s ultimate weapon, the Thunder Palace!  Can Fairy Tail recoup, find Laxus, and defeat him before time runs out?\nSource: crunchyroll",
