  "description" : "After a strange phone call, Meo’s father has gone missing. Her only clue is a heavy bag he’s entrusted her with. Desperate to find her father, Meo goes to Alice for help. When Narumi and the NEETs hear that her father used to be a money-launder for the yakuza, everyone is convinced her father took off.  But things aren’t quite matching up. Meo only has 200 million yen out of the supposed 300 million, so where is the missing money? And if he was going to run off, why didn’t he take Meo with him?  Just after Narumi confronts Meo about how her father probably bailed out on her, Alice finds a new clue. Could this point to her father’s innocence?",
