  "description" : "Six months has passed from the conquering of Druaga. King Gilgamesh had taken all the credit, and the former climbers who knew the truth were wasting their days away. Jil, who is unable to recover from the shock of Neeba and Kaaya disappearing in the “Mythical Tower,” is reclusing himself in his room at the inn he is freeloading at. Fatina is working as a tour guide, and is watching over him sometimes with patience, sometimes with severity. One day, the two encounter a little girl who is being pursued by the army.\nSource: crunchyroll",
