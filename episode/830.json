  "description" : "Haru, Elie, Musica, Plue, and Griff go to the beach to have some fun. They then all go to the Symphonia Museum, where there is rumors about the legend of the Rave Master. There are paintings that depict Shiba and Plue fifty years ago. Later on, Elie begins to experience dizziness, as she unwillingly leads herself in a room displaying a portrait that resembles her, seeing that her name is Resha Valentine. She then remembers that she visited Resha`s grave. Meanwhile, Sieg Hart says to Reina that he must kill Elie since she has the power of Etherion, even though he was assigned to kill Haru. Sieg Hart then senses Elie`s presence and begins to look for her from the sky. Haru, Musica, Plue, and Griff encounter a fortune teller than predicts a bad fate for Elie. Elie wanders off in the city, in tears of her memory.",
