  "description" : "Rinrin is furious when she learns the game development project was merely a pawn, but Gaku stops her from going to speak with Haru. If Gaku must fight Haru, then he`d rather do it his way. He reveals the situation to Sakura`s team, and together they plan to create a game that exceeds what Haru planned for them. That said, it`s a difficult task for a team that`s never produced a hit game before.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
