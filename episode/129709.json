  "description" : "Enpi-chan has broken a seal which has almost let demonic beasts from the realm of darkness escape - and there is only one way that they can be stopped now... and that is to use... `that`.\nBut the only way they can use `that` is by finding the key which Harumi has dropped somewhere - and if they don`t hurry and find it, the beasts are going to escape! Enma and the others all split up in search of the key, and even the Flame and Ice Tengu start working with them in order to prevent a disaster from happening.\nWill they be able to find the key before it`s too late? Will they be able to activate `that` in time!?\nSource: Official Site",
