During that time, she ends up meeting Asta, who ends up with Licht’s grimoire that has a different devil residing in it. Patry ends up reviving due to resurrection magic, and then he becomes the leader of the Eye of the Midnight Sun and vows to get revenge. This was all according to the devil’s plan and Secré uses her sealing magic to free Lumiere and Licht so they can finish off the devil once and for all along with Asta. The battle comes to an end, and Secré now begins her new life as a member of the Black Bulls.\nSource: crunchyroll",
