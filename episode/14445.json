  "description" : "Aion unveils to Rosette that he removed Chrono`s horns and has given them to Joshua, acquire him enhanced supernatural abilities. The side effect, however, is that the horns give him the power to hear the thoughts of others. Joshua attacks a frightened orphan in anguish, turning him into stone. Rosette is taken to the orphanage by Chrono, only to see many other orphans turned into stone. She sees Joshua, who warns her to get away from him because of the painful noises of thoughts in his head. A whirlwind erects and destroys the orphanage, but time freezes and the orphange stood still. Chrono takes Rosette away from the whirlwind, but he mentions that his astral energy is depleting due to the loss of his horns. The only other option is for the devil to make a contract with a human, in which the former`s power is augmented while the latter`s life is diminished. Rosette is willing to sacrifice her life to help save Joshua. Chrono accepts her request, and thus the two are bound by a pact. In present time, Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria head back to the convent after reminiscing in the past. Elsewhere, Aion visits Joshua and informs him that a third apostle is found. \nSource: Wikipedia",
