  "description" : "Keisaku is held hostage by an Outlaw - Widened Eye of Incineration, Emest Flieder, who believes that this way he`ll make Wilhelmina join them in battle. His partner, the Scatterer of Sparkling Light, Rebecca Reed, frees Keisaku and sends him back to Margery Daw with Wilhelmina`s reports. Rebecca flies to Wilhelmina, who has been her ally for a long time, and Sophie Sawallisch makes Emest the commander of the Tokyo Outlaw Headquarters. Meanwhile, at the Serei-den, Shana wonders why she couldn`t do anything against Yuji and why she was so scared when he tried to catch her. She remembers when her trainer, Shiro, told her that one day she will find the greatest power that can bring down anyone and anything and then he asks to her to hold his hand. Shana then remembers how every enemy she fought, held hands with someone and she recognizes the greatest power of love that lies on the palm of Yuji`s hand. Suddenly, there`s a loud noise and when Shana goes out, she sees dead bodies and above them - the Master Throne, Hecate. She responds that Shana is no longer needed.\nSource: Wikipedia",
