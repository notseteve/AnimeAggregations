  "description" : "With the Spring Prayer finished, Main and the others returned to the cathedral. Sylvester appoints Main as his guide to show him around the orphanage and workshop, where they observe how the scripture picture books are made. As he leaves, Sylvester gives Main a necklace with a black stone, saying it`s a protection charm just in case anything were to happen. Meanwhile, Ferdinand, who had also witnessed the books being made, tells Main`s method of making books will change history and how dangerous that may be.\nSource: crunchyroll",
