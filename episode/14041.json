  "description" : "Father Remington reports that the moon has turned red and the sun has shaded black, which are omens symbolizing Aion is soon approaching. Sister Kate notes that red hail from the sky was sent by Aion in order for Pandemonium to breach the Seal of the Seven Wings. Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria are called into action as they scramble to restore the seal and fend off any miasma bypassing the breach. Satella accompanies the three, later being able to restore the seal. The tables are turned when Aion, who is a former acquaintance of Chrono, makes an appearance, overwhelming the four. While he attacks Chrono, Aion explains that Joshua is still alive. He also proposes to Azmaria to join him, since she is an apostle of charity. Just as an enraged Chrono attempts to transform, Azmaria releases her powers to vanish Aion, unexpectedly after accepting his offer. Nevertheless, what was really vanish was merely a shadow of Aion. \nSource: Wikipedia",
