Mikado observes the girls one day and notices their interest in konpeito candy after they have an encounter with some local children. Mikado then decides to set off on his own to get some. Worried for Mikado`s wellbeing, Yamazaki sends Hyo and Kasumi to keep an eye on him. Meanwhile, a new commander of Susanoo follows Mikado like a sinister shadow.\nSource: crunchyroll",
