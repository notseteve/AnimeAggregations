  "description" : "Aichi is trying to decide whether to enter Card Capital`s upcoming Shop Tournament, but is worried that he isn`t good enough to compete.  He finds himself coming to the shop anyway, and there`s only two spots left! Just then, Kai walks in, and submits his entry form. Knowing that he might get to fight Kai if he enters, Aichi leaps at the chance, but just before he enters, another person sneaks in their application at the same time! There`s only one spot left in the tournament, so there`s only one way to settle this: An on-the-spot fight! Aichi is full of motivation, but can he defeat an opponent who seems to have accounted for everything?\nSource: crunchyroll",
