  "description" : "Jil barely escapes from the scene of the King`s assassination thanks to the quick-wit of Neeba. The next day, the review of troops by the King goes on as scheduled. At the ceremony, Jil is dumbstruck; before him is none other than King Gilgamesh who he saw murdered the night before! Meanwhile in the city of Meskia, a giant slime that suddenly appeared was causing much havoc. A young girl named Coopa is embodied by the slime but is quickly rescued by Ahmey. When Coopa learns that Jil and the others are \"Climbers\", she insists on allowing herself and her master, a mage named Melt, to joint their party.\nSource: crunchyroll",
