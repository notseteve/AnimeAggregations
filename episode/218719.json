  "description" : "Boruto and Konohamaru pay a visit to Remon`s village, but are puzzled by Remon`s cold demeanor. It turns out that Remon is a descendant of the Souma, a family that has protected the village from goblins for many generations. Thus, she is not allowed to leave the village freely. Furthermore, an important ritual is to be held shortly, so Kankitsu Akitsuki, Remon`s childhood friend, imprisons her to prevent her from seeing anyone.\nSource: crunchyroll",
