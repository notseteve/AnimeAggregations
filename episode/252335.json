  "description" : "Now that their ship has been repaired, Boruto and the others will soon be leaving the island of shipbuilders. Ikada, now friends with Boruto, promises to achieve his dream and pay him a visit. But then Ikada’s sister Seiren appears before him and tries to drag him back home. When Ikada left home, Seiren was his only ally, so he is sad to see her so unwilling to understand his feelings. Meanwhile, Buntan, Hebiichigo, and Kyoho wait for the ship to depart. They had been promised reduced sentences for their work, but they learn that they won’t be rewarded as much as they thought!\nSource: crunchyroll",
