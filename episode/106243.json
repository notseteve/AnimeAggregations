  "description" : "Tsuna receives a letter. Inside the letter, there is a photo of someone wearing  sunglasses and a note that reads “Try and catch me.” I-Pin sees the photo and is in shock. Reborn says that the person in the photo is I-Pin’s master, Fon, the holder of the red pacifier of the Arcobaleno. I-Pin wants to help Tsuna, but cannot help but is clearly hesitant to capture someone to whom he pledged his loyalty. Perceiving that I-Pin felt that way, Tsuna takes off by himself for the test. The test with Fon is a game of tag. Will Tsuna be able to catch the swift Bushido master?\nSource: crunchyroll",
