A battle ensues and Kiyo is at a disadvantage. During the course of the battle, Kiyo is about unravel Robnos` attacks; He realizes that Robnos` laser attacks are able to reflect off the walls and that there were actually two Robnos firing lasers. Using \"Jikerdor\" Kiyo pins one of the Robnos down. The two Robnos then fuses into one making \"Zaker\" infective against him. Kiyo manages to stab a pole into Robnos`s head and with \"Zaker\" aimed at the pole, overloads the charger in Robnos` head. The pair defeated reveal that they never had Suzy and that a Mamodo that looks like Zatch was spotted in England.",
