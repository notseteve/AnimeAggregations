  "description" : "Fujimaru and company are dumbfounded by Gilgamesh`s sudden visitation of the Chaldean Embassy. There, they are given a new request from the king which is to investigate the Persian Gulf. Merlin and Ana cannot join as they have no travel permits. In other words, this will be Fujimaru`s first journey alone with Mash in a while. But there sat the noble king, reciting a poem and cocking his head in contemplation. Having fun with tales of the past, Fujimaru and company`s journey will finally become a lively one.\nSource: crunchyroll",
