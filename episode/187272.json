  "description" : "Ruriko, the theater club advisor who`s just returned from a theater trip in Europe, tells the club members that the script she wrote to demonstrate everything she learned in her travels will be the play they perform at the upcoming culture festival. She`s chosen Hinako to play the heroine, but Hinako messes up everything she tries to do. Yua, who feels she`s lost the leading role to a complete theater newbie, expresses her displeasure in no uncertain terms, but as she watches Hinako trying her hardest, she finds her opinions changing.\nSource: crunchyroll",
