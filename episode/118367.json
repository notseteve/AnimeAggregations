  "description" : "One day, Natsuki’s friend Takeshi asks her to help out his soccer team, the “Hanasaki Kickers”, by playing in a match for them. Apparently his team has never won a game. On top of that, they will disband the team after this next match, so they don’t want to lose under any circumstances. Even then, Natsumi tries to refuse by saying that “It’s none of my business”. But when the other players laugh at the prospect of having a girl help them out, she unleashes her athletic prowess and takes the boys down a notch. And she ends up agreeing to help out… The day of the match is already near; however, one of the players, Mamoru, asks Natsuki to withdraw from the match.\nSource: crunchyroll",
