  "description" : "A boy named Rio comes to the shrine. His mother is afflicted by a mysterious disease that has turned her ears into pot stickers. His mother claims not to know what the cause is, but she is distraught because they are preventing her not only from hearing the voices of others, but Rio`s voice as well. Ramune explains that there are voices she can hear and voices she can`t, and that it`s an emotional problem. He decides to wait and see how her condition changes.\nSource: crunchyroll",
