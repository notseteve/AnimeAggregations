  "description" : "A therapy relaxation room planned out by Thunderland Jr. has opened up in the Bee-Hive. Lag and Connor are curious and drag along Zazie to go check it out right away. The caretaker for the rest and relaxation room, Mana Jones, lost her sight in an accident, but she has an amazing sense of smell and is a plant specialist. Mana heard about Lag from Gauche in the past, and begins to tell him about what happened during the accident and why Gauche and Dr. Thunderland Jr. are the ones who enabled her to continue her work.\nSource: crunchyroll",
