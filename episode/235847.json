  "description" : "The missing Emilia was in the graveyard all along, her lost memories beginning to return due to Puck`s disappearance. Confused and losing heart over the realization that she`s forgotten such important memories, she tries her hardest to convey her feelings to Subaru. When the two of them leave the graveyard, they`re awaited by Garfiel, who`s been battered and beaten by Otto and Ram. He tries to prevent the Sanctuary`s liberation by closing off the graveyard himself, but Subaru won`t let him have his way without a fight.\nSource: crunchyroll",
