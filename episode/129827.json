  "description" : "After Daru updates the Phone Microwave`s firmware, Rintaro decides to perform an experiment attempting to change history by sending winning lottery numbers to the past. Upon sending the D-Mail, he experiences a sensation similar to the one he had before the satellite crash. Discovering no one else was aware that the experiment even took place, Rintaro finds his D-Mail had indeed led to Ruka purchasing a lottery ticket, although his own personal error led him to get the number wrong. After a brief encounter with Suzuha, Rintaro deduces that the D-Mail had shifted him to a World Line Ruka had bought a lottery ticket and the D-Mail experiment never took place, explaining everyone`s altered memories. Confused as to why only he can remember the previous World Line, Rintaro contacts Titor, who tells him he may have the power to become a messiah and lead the world beyond the \"1% Divergence\" point and hence, change the dystopian future.\nSource: Wikipedia",
