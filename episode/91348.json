  "description" : "Okita and the First Squad are in charge of cleaning the Shinsengumi headquarters’ bathroom for the week. Everyone mutters complaints as they polish toilets. But one man happily works without complaint. It is Seizo Kumanaku, who is well known within the Shinsengumi as a neat freak. He lectures his squad mates about the importance of a clean bathroom, but it fails to raise their spirits. Seizo is irritated by how dirty the toilets are and he suggests to Hijikata that they have a Bathroom Revolution.\nSource: crunchyroll",
