As she decides to remain inconspicuous and focus on skipping through the grades, she finds herself the target of bullying from some of the other students, including a young Y.  Believing her to be the mastermind, she finds herself alienated from a girl called \"Curly\" who was trying to become her friend. One day, the heroine rescues a fairy from a group of bullies and has it tag along with her. As the stress of her school life leads the heroine to admit to herself that she feels lonely, the fairy does something before disappearing. The heroine finds Curly has joined her in skipping grades, also facing some bullying from jealous peers. As the heroine decides to repay some of her kindness, she finds Curly to be disturbingly affectionate with her.
