  "description" : "The Owl Mask is smashed and falls to the ground revealing this god to have the same face as Mubyou. She explains that she is the real Mubyou, and that the other Mubyou has the same face as she does. When Kuugen runs to the aid of Toru, the copy Mubyou threatens that Toru will be engulfed in flames from the Sakasaen. Kuu taunts her to try it; however, when the copy Mubyou sets the fire on Toru, the flames are reversed and set her alight instead. Kuu reveals that the reason this happened was because of the mirror enchantment she had placed on the green bracelet which she had given to Toru. Mubyou is revealed as a living doll modeled to resemble the true Mubyou. Mubyou gives the Mubyou-doll her cloak and tells Kuugen that she looks forward to when they will meet again in eight years. Kou is shown running after the spirit dragon which left her. The next day, Mubyou gives Kou the Reverse Circle and departs.\nSource: crunchyroll",
