Rima is the new Queen`s Chair and Kairi Sanjo is the new Jack`s Chair. The new Guardians introduce themselves, but things starts off roughly and Amu is unable to tell anyone about the diamond egg. To deal with the rise in X Eggs, Tadase decides that the other guardians will help Amu by splitting up into teams and search for them. Amu is first paired with Rima and the two eventually find an X Egg. However, Amu is unable to capture it. Rima and her Guardian Character, Kusukusu, Character Transforms and become Clown Drop. Instead of purifying the egg, they destroy it. Amu becomes upset with Rima even though Rima does not understand why.
