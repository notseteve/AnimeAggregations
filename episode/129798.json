  "description" : "Komatsu discovers that Mansem can heal himself by disinfecting his wounds. Bei tries to attack the Battle Wolf and her cub, but Rin uses the Endorphin Smoke technique on him. Mansem informs Komatsu that the Battle Wolf has given love to her cub which has been passed down for generations, and that a GT Robot can be manipulated by a human. Enraged at the near-death of the Battle Wolf, Toriko activates his gourmet cells and confronts the GT Robot. Toriko uses his Five-Fold Spike Punch and Ice Pick techniques on the GT Robot in a futile attempt to destroy it. The GT Robot attempts to kill Toriko, but he uses the Five-Fold Ice Pick Spiked Punch technique on the GT Robot - destroying its head. Mansem orders his men to fire the laser cannons on the robot, revealing its core antenna. The antenna flees from the attacks, but is obliterated by the beast Ricky. The Battle Wolf dies while standing up and Toriko, having befriended the cub, names him Terry Cloth. While eating, Toriko and Komatsu discovers that the Regal Mammoth has been stolen. Rin tells them that her brother has captured a Regal Mammoth on an island.\nSource: Wikipedia",
