  "description" : "When Uncle Akio turns on his TV, the news program \"QTV News\" is just beginning... and the newscasters are Ashibe-kun and Goma-chan?! All the news stories they read seem very trivial. The news program is followed by \"Goma-chan Calisthenics\" and \"Goma-chan`s Language Lesson\"... in fact, it seems all the programs on QTV are rather strange. What kind of program will air next? Don`t change that channel!\nSource: crunchyroll",
