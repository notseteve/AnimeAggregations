  "description" : "Kagami defends Kiriko and tries to keep her from getting expelled, telling Makina that she has no right to expel her without understanding the dignity of maids. With the headmaster Hiiragi`s support he gets Makina to work for a day in the same Maid Café that Kiriko works in, and Suzune is pressed into service as well. Makina is unable to perform many of the duties, such as casting the \"moe-moe-kyun!\" spell on Kagami`s French fries, which he has Kiriko do instead (earning her the nickname `Potato` ポテト). Makina begins to realise the subtleties of the work Kiriko has to do, being sensitive to what her customers want and fulfilling them as best she can. Makina, however, sticks to her guns, saying that she has Kiriko expelled because work at a Maid Café is unbecoming for the image of the school. To this, he has Kiriko perform a song and dance on the roof of the café building, realising that she is Cutter Girl, the anonymous underground maid idol making waves on the Internet. A live stream of the event quickly gets an audience of over ten million viewers, showing that what Kiriko does is not unacceptable or unbecoming.",
