  "description" : "There are three remaining Arcobaleno tests, one of which is the sky Arcobaleno. Tsuna resembles the Arcobaleno and thus takes an interest in them, but Reborn tells him that the sky Arcobaleno has been missing for quite a while. So how will the sky Arcobaleno test be carried out? Just then, an unknown woman comes to Tsuna’s house with Kyoko and Haru, carrying the orange pacifier. The mystery grows when the woman asks Tsuna to take her, along with Kyoko and Haru, on a tour around Namimori. Does this have anything to do with the tests?\nSource: crunchyroll",
