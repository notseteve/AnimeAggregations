Reoko called forth Entei in Ueno to bring the long-buried existence of Buranki to light, but Migiwa burned Entei`s limbs to stop this uprising, which left Reoko`s body with the curse it still bears today. Why did Reoko decide to walk a path of blood after she was released from her years of confinement? Their hidden past is finally revealed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
