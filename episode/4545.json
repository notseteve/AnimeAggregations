  "description" : "Wishing to no longer be dependent on the guest room, Rakka is looking for her own room at Old Home. Winter is close, so Kuu gives Rakka an overcoat that has always been too large for her to wear it, and a hint where to find the most suitable room for her. They both missed breakfast, so Reki provides them with lunch packets. Then a storm arises, and in the dangerous Western Woods a mysterious light ascends into the sky.",
