  "description" : "Mirei receives an elaborately-phrased letter from July, intended to give her ability the name of \"Grateful Robber\", but misreads it as \"Grateful Lover\", misinterpreting the letter as a love letter and declaring herself to now be July`s girlfriend, leading the entire club, July included, baffled. After having to deal with both Mirei`s over-the-top affections and the jealous glares of the other girls, July explains the situation to Mirei, who seems heartbroken from being turned down. As Kanzaki Tomoyo comes to cheer up July during his moment of guilt, he explains he chose that particular name for Mirei`s power so it would match the others and show that she was one of their friends. Afterwards, July receives an e-mail from Mirei apologising for the misunderstanding and accepting the name he gave her power.\nSource: Wikipedia",
