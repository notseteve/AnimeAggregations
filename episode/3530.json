Still, I`m so glad she`s my friend! We found ou tthe Voice card had stolen my voice. Sakura was really upset, which made me sad, but I knew she could capture it and get my voice back. Xiaolang had a great idea to lure the Voice card out, and it worked! Sakura captured it and got my voice back just like I knew she would.\nSource: crunchyroll",
