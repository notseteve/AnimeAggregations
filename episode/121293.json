  "description" : "The battle between the Varia and the duo Zakuro and Bluebell is only getting more intense. Tsuna, who can only worry from afar, begins to sense that something terrible has happened. Reborn doesn’t help his angst when he says that the Varia may be strong, but their chances against the superhuman real six Funeral Wreaths are slim. Over at the scene of the battle, the Varia are indeed struggling against the real six Funeral Wreaths. Bel, Levi, and Lussuria have been captured by one of Bluebell’s attacks, and even Xanxus is hit by Kikyo’s Spinosaurus.\nSource: crunchyroll",
