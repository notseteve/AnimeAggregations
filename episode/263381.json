  "description" : "Mahiru and Amane ring in the new year together. When the exhaustion from cooking catches up with Mahiru and she falls asleep in Amane`s arms, Amane has no choice but to let her stay the night in his bed. The sight of her sleeping peacefully but totally unguarded gives him a bit of a jolt. Two days later, Amane`s parents come to visit. When the four go to Hatsumode (the first shrine visit of the year), Amane is taken aback by how pretty Mahiru looks in a kimono. Meanwhile, Mahiru keeps blushing at the sight of Amane dressed up so handsomely.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
