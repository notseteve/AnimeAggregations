  "description" : "Ganta learns from a fellow inmate, You Takami, that in order to have a decent meal in the prison, he needs to earn Cast Points. He learns of a `Dog Race` in which he can win a big prize, which he and Shiro decide to enter. In the lockerroom, they encounter a fierce inmate named Kazumasi Kouzuma who drives fear into the others until the warden silences him. Ganta soon learns that in order to avoid being killed by a poison, he needs to eat an antidote known as Candy, which was secretly stolen from his bag by You the other day. Ganta realises that in order to survive, he needs to win the race in order to purchase a new one, but he soon learns the course is littered with actual death traps. Thanks in part to Shiro`s innocent manner, Ganta and Shiro make it to the final stage against Kasumasi where they have to hold onto a ball and avoid falling into a spike pit. Ganta decides to stand up to Kazumasi, who eventually falls to his death. In the closing moments of the round, Ganta is forced to sacrifice the ball, and the prize money, in order to keep Shiro from falling and keep their promise of eating the runner up prize together.",
