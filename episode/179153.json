  "description" : "Banagher struggles against the psycho-jammers of Angelo`s Rozen Zulu. Meanwhile, as Riddhe confronts Marida, he is overwhelmed by a thought resonance phenomenon and destroys the Kshatriya Repaired. Marida`s last thoughts reach Zinnerman, Mineva, and the others, warning them that the sector is dangerous. With the shock of her death, the Unicorn Gundam emits psycho-waves beyond measurement, and the bewildered Angelo destroys his own machine. With Zinnerman`s help, the Nahel Argama successfully holds off the Sleeves fleet and reaches Industrial 7 airspace. At the same time, Bright enters the Cheyenne base to confront Martha and Riddhe`s father Ronan. And at Magallanica, where Banagher and Mineva are headed, Syam Vist awaits.\nSource: crunchyroll",
