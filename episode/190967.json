  "description" : "Masanobu Kousaka, a vassal of Shingen Takeda, comes to Hideyoshi bearing a large number of gifts. He tells them that another portion of the gifts are in a nearby temple. Mitsunari and Hideyoshi`s other vassals are suspicious that this is a trap, but Hideyoshi heads to the temple without a care. At the temple, Shingen`s other vassals--Masakage Yamagata, Masatoyo Naitou, Nobuharu Baba--along with the warlord Shingen himself, are waiting. Shingen offers to form an alliance and fight against the Oda Army, but Hideyoshi refuses. There seems to be a mysterious connection between Hideyoshi and Nobunaga.\nSource: crunchyroll",
