  "description" : "It`s an emergency! Time has stopped in Edo! In the very first episode of the new season, time has frozen for everything and everyone except Gin-san, Kagura, and Shinpachi! Apparently the cause is the Universal Clock, which Gin-san found lying in the street and brought home with him, only to destroy it thinking it was an alarm clock. The Odd Jobs run around in circles while trying to get the clock repaired. Just what does fate have in store for Edo?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
