  "description" : "Charm cards, which look a lot like Clow Cards, became really popular at our school. Naoko and Chiharu bought several ones, but when I went with Sakura to get her a cooking one, Ms. Maki was all sold out. When we came back the next day, Sakura sensed that a Clow Card used to be in the shop, but was no longer there. We discovered Meiling had bought the Shot card, thinking it was just a charm card. Sakura and Xiaolang found her on the roof of the school, but Meiling activated the card by accident, and it targeted him! Sakura and Xiaolang worked together to seal the dangerous card away, and I got it all on tape!\nSource: crunchyroll",
