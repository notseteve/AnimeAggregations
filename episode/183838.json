  "description" : "Tanya`s new battalion is off the ground and running, and it`s time for them to do their first mission: fight back a massive invasion by the Dakian Dukedom to the southeast.  The enemy army numbers in the hundreds of thousands, but they`ve brought no air units at all, which makes them easy pickings for Tanya`s highly trained force.  After wiping out the enemy army, she heads straight for the enemy capital and launches an attack there.\nSource: crunchyroll",
