  "description" : "Kazuto visits Andrew, who explains that the screenshot he sent originated from Alfheim Online (ALO), an MMO where players take the role of fairies capable of flight. He explains that the figure resembling Asuna was spotted somewhere on the game`s World Tree. Noticing that RECTO created the game, Kazuto decides to don his NerveGear once again and take up his role as Kirito in ALO. After selecting his character race as a Spriggan and diving in, he enters a strange warphole which leads him to a forest, where he finds to his surprise that his stats are identical to his SAO avatar`s, with the exception of his dual wielding skill. He also discovers that he still has the SAO in-game item containing Yui`s data, which he activates to bring Yui into ALfheim as a Navigation Pixie to their reunion. Yui deduces that the game is made using a copy of SAO`s servers, which was why all common skills and stats from SAO had been carried over to Kirito`s ALO avatar. As Kirito gets used to his flight controls, two Sylph players are being chased by Salamander players. Just as one is defeated and the other named Leafa outnumbered, Kirito crash lands before her and steps in to help defeat the assailants.\nSource: Wiki",
