  "description" : "It`s the \"Holy Night\" season, a festival from the northern area of Amberground. They say that two old men go around on the Holy Night delivering presents to children. In order to continue that tradition, Lag, along with Zazie, deliver presents to children that have been collected by charitable organizations. They meet a girl, Sonja Malmola, and granting her wish, they stay for dinner with her. Zazie helps with the shopping, but the way the villagers treat the girl is suspicious.  Her parents were killed by gaichuu, and she lives all by herself.\nSource: crunchyroll",
