  "description" : "Mom is tasked with running the games at the kindergarten bazaar. The previous day Mom ignored her work to slave over making some game character cosplay outfits. The kids run in, delighted, and Mom is satisfied. At the bazaar, Chi`s mother joins in selling frankfurters. She sighs as she is tasked with a quota of selling 1500 in one day. Dad rushes in right before the end of the bazaar to capitalize on the discounts. Mom wants him to buy some silverware but for whatever reason he doesn`t act as the prices plummet. The bazaar ends. The boss, Kenta, Ma`s mother, who worked the games, and Chi`s mother who cooked the frankfurters all celebrate a successful day of sales.\nSource: crunchyroll",
