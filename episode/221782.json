  "description" : "Kitaro receives a request from a photographer named Kunou who says he`s being haunted by a ghost. That night, Kitaro accompanies him to where he`s supposed to meet someone, and the ghost of a woman swoops down on Kunou. Kitaro dodges the attack and sees that the ghost is a youkai that attached itself to a corpse, a mouryou. When he asks if the Kunou knew the woman whose corpse the mouryou has possessed, Kunou shakes his head in denial. Suspicious of his reaction, Kitaro searches for the truth, heading to Mukuromura where the mouryou lives. Who was the dead woman? And why is the mouryou attacking Kunou?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
