  "description" : "Barragan appears to be defeated by the combined efforts of Hachigen and Soi Fon. But the two are shocked to find Barragan forcing open Hachigen’s Shiju Saimon barrier. As king of Hueco Mundo, Barragan is determined to show the world his absolute strength and power. His reason originates as far back to when he once reigned over his subjects in Las Noches. Having no enemies to conquer, Barragan would pit his subjects against one another to fight off his boredom. That was when Aizen arrived in Hueco Mundo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
