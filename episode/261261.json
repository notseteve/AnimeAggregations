  "description" : "Day 2 of the Harvest Festival, and the Iruma and Lead team were still at zero points, so they decide to try to get the Legendary Leaf to turn things around. With that in mind, they go visit Camui. Once they find him, they also encounter a horde of magical beasts and a little kingdom that had been established. The two are captured and suddenly brought in front of the queen of the kingdom, which just so happened to be Keroli?! Meanwhile, Ameri was thinking back about her time at the Harvest Festival, as she was watching Iruma`s performance from the broadcast tent.\nSource: crunchyroll",
