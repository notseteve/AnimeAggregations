  "description" : "Whilst wondering about the mysterious new armor, Tony and Chika are kidnapped. Nanami spots Tony`s car and attempts to follow it, but they are stopped by a Zodiac. Tony and Chika awake to find themselves on a remote island, and Tony`s arc reactor is missing. They are then approached by Yinsen, who reveals himself to be a member of Zodiac and tells Tony he has 24 hours of pacemaker power to decide whether to join Zodiac or not. Tony and Chika attempt to use the various scrap on the island to find a method of escape, but are thwarted at every opportunity. They eventually manage to evade him by using a hologram, and manage to build a flare to alert Sakurai, who had received some information from Nanami. Impressed by him not using weapons, Yinsen returns the arc reactor before escaping. As they wait for rescue, Tony and Chika kiss each other.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
