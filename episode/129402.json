  "description" : "Believing him to be the red man, Ganta attacks the strange inmate, known as Senji \"Crow\" Kiyomasa, but falls at a disadvantage against the blades he can form with his blood. After learning the nature of his power, The Branches of Sin, Ganta launches a counterattack, though soon realizes he is not the Wretched Egg, but one of several `Deadmen` with that power. Crow tries to attack Ganta again, but finds himself weak against Shiro before a special unit appears, tranquilising Ganta and Crow and taking Shiro and You to an empty corridor. As Ganta is examined, he comes face to face with Tamaki, who reveals he rigged Ganta`s jury verdict to get him sent to Deadman Wonderland before revealing Ganta will face off against Crow in a battle the next day, tempting him with the prospect of coming face to face with Wretched Egg. As Ganta is tortured with footage of what a Corpse Carnival entails, Makina decides to confront the director concerning the mysteries of G-Block.",
