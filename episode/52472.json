  "description" : "Back in the Soul Society, Rukia is at a stand still as she faces the ever arogant Yoshi in the middle of the Rukon District.  With Lirin by her side and lacking most of her Soul Reaper powers, Rukia decides to stay and fight with what little spirit energy she has left. A Mod Soul and Martial Arts might not be enough to take on the reishi absorbing, blood thirsty Yoshi and her Nieder Sword Attacks this time.\nSource: crunchyroll",
