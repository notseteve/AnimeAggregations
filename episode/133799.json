  "description" : "Hecate feels that Shana is a threat to them and should be killed and proceeds to attack her, but Yuji comes and saves her. Meanwhile, Kazumi meets Khamsin and asks him about the meaning behind the Treasure that Pheles gave her, since her feelings towards Yuji are changed after he rejected her. Back at the Serei-den, Yuji opens the Divine Gate, through which he intends to go and bring back the Snake of the Festival`s true body and change the world. He then takes Shana and the Trinity with him to announce his plans to all Denizens as they prepare for the war. Then he, along with Bel Peol, Sydonay and Hecate, go through the gate.\nSource: Wikipedia",
