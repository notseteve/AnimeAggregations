  "description" : "Kinji finds that Aria is overbearing and bossy, moving into his apartment when he refuses to become part of her Butei Assault Team. This leads to some awkwardness when Hotogi Shirayuki visits him that night while Aria is in the bath. The next day, Aria follows Kinji around while he tries to complete a low-level Butei mission involving finding a lost cat. After escaping from Aria he meets up with his friend Mine Riko and trades eroges with her for information on Aria. Later, Aria finally convinces Kinji to join her Butei team for one mission so she can see his mysterious Hysteria Mode in action.",
