  "description" : "Kawase has suggested that Subaru start working on a new series, but Subaru can`t come up with any good ideas. So, at Kawase`s recommendation, he decides to try taking a trip somewhere for a change of pace. As he`s thinking about where to go, he suddenly notices his mother`s flower garden in the yard, which she had planted as a gift to him using seeds and seedlings from places she`d traveled to. Each plant is labeled with the location it was acquired from, but the space labeled \"Tokushima\" has nothing planted in it... so Subaru decides to visit Tokushima.\nSource: crunchyroll",
