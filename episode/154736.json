  "description" : "Ryuko is fatigued after her battle and flees, passing out and ending up in the care of Mako`s family. That night, Ryuko recalls how she was introduced to the uniform, which she decides to name Senketsu, who was created by her father, Isshin. The next day, Ryuko comes across the tennis club captain, Omiko Hakodate, who knocks her away when Senketsu fails to activate. She is found by Aikuro, who explains Senketsu is a Kamui that requires her blood to operate, providing her with a glove to help her in this regard. He offers to provide more information about Senketsu in exchange for Omiko`s defeat. Ryuko goes to face Omiko which, after some interference from Mako, results in a tennis match between the two. Ryuko gets off to a rough start, but eventually manages to fight back with her scissor blade and destroy Omiko`s Goku Uniform, winning the match on a technicality. Afterwards, Satsuki herself appears before Ryuko to challenge her to a fight, but due to lack of blood remaining she flees.",
