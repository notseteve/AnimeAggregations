  "description" : "Being outmatched by the powerful Touto offense lineup, Hikaru steps off the mound and Urabe steps up as the relief pitcher for the Dolphins.\nThanks to Urabe`s clean pitching and the recovered Hikaru`s exciting homerun, they give chase, putting up an intense fight to get back into the game.\nAnd then, in the top of the 5th inning, the Dolphins` batters get a handle on Touto`s tired starting pitcher, Komatsu. Once again, it`s anyone`s game!\nNobody had expected the Dolphins to be a real opponent, but finally, Touto`s ace, Mayumura Michiru, heads to the mound.\nSource: crunchyroll",
