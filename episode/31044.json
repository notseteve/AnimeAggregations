  "description" : "One night while she is counting the days to Christmas on her fingers, Melmo finds an abandoned child. She gives a candy to the child to make him grow up to be a boy, and finds out that the child is named Tadao and was abandoned by his parents who had lost their jobs. Melmo then turns the president, who abandoned Tadao`s father, into an old man. The president apologizes in a fit of tears, and he promises that he will by all means find Tadao`s parents and take care of them. In the meantime, Tadao`s parents are heading for a snowy mountain to commit suicide. \nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
