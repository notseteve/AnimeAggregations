  "description" : "After accompanying Subaru to Nana`s apartment to return her key, Haru had an emotional reunion with her younger brother, Hachi. Then, suddenly, a man with a scary face busts into the room! He turns out to be Nana`s younger Yugo, and despite his large stature, Haru is relieved to see Hachi and Roku happily playing with him. Then Subaru spots a magazine called Polaris in Yugo`s bag—the very magazine that`s serializing Subaru`s novel.\nSource: crunchyroll",
