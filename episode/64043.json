  "description" : "Tsuna Sawada, otherwise known as Tsuna, is bad at studying, bad at sports, and clumsy at everything he does. In short, he’s got a loser mentality and lives his life half-heartedly. But one day, a strange tutor appears before him: a baby wearing a suit! Claiming to be a hitman named Reborn, the baby suddenly shoots Tsuna in the forehead. For five minutes, Tsuna displays physical skills and energy that he would never believe possible. When he returns to normal, Reborn tells Tsuna that he`s come from Italy to raise him to be a mafia boss. It’s the beginning of Tsuna`s incredibly dangerous and incredibly lively new life!\nSource: crunchyroll",
