  "description" : "In the cellar, the scarred woman attacks Mana, but Mana and Nanao escape. Then the woman uses the surgical instruments to remove the skin from her face and to replace it with the unscarred face, becoming the woman Nanao thinks is his mother. Not knowing the two women are the same person, Nanao tells her where the injured Mana is hiding. As Nanao`s mother is dragging Mana to the cellar, Yuta and the older Nanao arrive. Mana throws the box with the scarred face outside, where it opens to allow Yuta to see its contents. Nanao`s mother admits that she replaced the face scarred from mermaid poison with one she got from the corpse of a woman who washed ashore. Nanao`s mother locks herself and Nanao in the cellar so the others cannot stop her from feeding him mermaid flesh. As the scar appears on her new face, she doubts that the mermaid flesh is not poison. Mana knocks the flesh from Nanao`s hands as he tries to eat it. Nanao`s mother gives him back to the older Nanao and walks off into the fog.\nSource: Wiki",
