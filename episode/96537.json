  "description" : "Washizu is still thinking of how to return Ibuki`s handkerchief, and eventually decides to do so by putting it in her shoe locker along with a note. However, he makes a big mistake and puts the handkerchief and letter in Yoichi`s locker instead. Yoichi meets him at the rooftop, who misinterprets the letter as signifying that he is interested in martial arts. But as Ibuki is also there he cannot deny it, and he winds up joining the Ikaruga dojo. At training he is considered a newbie beside all of the kids, and as such has to perform basic exercises. He starts off with push-ups, and winds up doing 400 and is nearly exhausted, but Yoichi says that as punishment he has to do a little more, and so the two of them wind up doing 1000 push ups in total. They later have dinner together as Chihaya has received a royalty check from her manga publisher and decides to treat everyone.\nMeanwhile, the mysterious masked man has this time hired the assassin Nuezeme Jinjuurou to murder Yoichi, but the man proves to have a terrible sense of direction and goes further away instead.",
