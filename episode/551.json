  "description" : "Two days before the millennium is coming to an end, the boys are talking about how Nostradamus` prophecies were totally off the year before, and how much has happened since then.\nMeanwhile, lots of rumors are spreading, such as: \"If you`re together with the one you love at the end of the millennium then your love will grow.\" which is what Natsue read in a magazine and tells Yoshihiko. At the same time, Makoto and Yumi look up a rumor in the Internet claiming that \"If you`re together with the one you love at the end of the millennium then you two will eventually part.\"\nAnd Aki happens to read that Nostradamus foretold the collapse of the world on December 31st, 2000.",
