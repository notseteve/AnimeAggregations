  "description" : "There are only a few months left until the showdown with the Arrancars. Ichigo continues to train with the Visoreds, but the amount of time in which he can remain Hollowfied hasn`t increased by much. In the Soul Society, Rukia and Orihime have also been undergoing rigorous training. Ukitake happily watches the two and is pleased that Rukia finally has friends. Sosuke Aizen may have plans to cut their training short as he calls on his Espada.\nSource: crunchyroll",
