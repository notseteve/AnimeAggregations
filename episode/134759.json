  "description" : "Ringo and Himari were out shopping when Ringo received a call from Yuri, who invites her and Himari to meet for a meal. But when they arrive for the meeting, they find Tabuki instead of Yuri, and the meeting place is not a restaurant at all - it`s a construction site. Tabuki was the one who told Ringo not to have hard feelings against the Takakura family due to events in the past - but now he seems to be the one seeking revenge.\nTabuki calls Kamba and informs him that his sister has been kidnapped, and unless Kamba brings his father to meet with Tabuki... who knows what will happen is going to happen to her?!\nSource: Official Site",
