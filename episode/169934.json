  "description" : "Miss Monochrome and the others hold a concert production meeting in the conference room of Heimin Records, where Yayoi works. While Yayoi is away, Miss Monochrome wins and returns with the Woose-demy Award for Best Mannequin Act from the world of dreams and illusions, and jokingly brings up the idea of a live-concert master of ceremonies. Meanwhile, Yayoi proposes a production that puts the band members in the spotlight. The coworker Akiko is eager to do a guitar solo and starts to show off her incredible guitar technique, but this leaves Miss Monochrome with a dubious look on her face.\nSource: crunchyroll",
