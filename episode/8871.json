  "description" : "Keiki comes to Takuho and Yoko rides him to the Royal Army to prove her legitimacy as the queen.  Yoko orders the Royal Army and State Army to go arrest Gaho and Seikyo and save Enho.  Yoko goes back to the rebels to thank them for doing the job for her.  When Yoko goes back to the palace, she asks Shokei and Suzu to join her, appoints Kokan as the Chosai, Shohaku(Enho) as Taishi, Kantai as the Royal Army General, and Saibo as the Wa State’s leader.  She also bans bowing because bowing as a rule does more harm than good to everyone.  She believes that one must have courage and earn respect, and that’s good for the kingdom.\nSource: crunchyroll",
