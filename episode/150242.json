  "description" : "Hello! It`s Amaya Kanaka!\nI believe it`s always important to be prepared for anything! And so, I`m going to say something that`s not very good! I`m now going to say something nice! ...If I said that, I`d be raising the bar too much. ...Crap, I forgot what I was going to say. Anyway, it`s the last episode. That was really fast. Anyway, thank you very much! It would make me very happy if we can meet somewhere again! Everyone, please don`t forget Amaya Kanaka!\n*The last episode is about summer vacation.\nSource: crunchyroll",
