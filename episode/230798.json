Kricketina wants to trade her Heracross for Goh’s Pinsir, but Goh can’t bring himself to do it. Trying to lure a wild Pinsir, Kricketina sets out a batch of homemade treats, but the food ends up attracting a ravenous Team Rocket instead!

Then, after Goh catches a wild Pinsir, he’s ready to trade with Kricketina, and Heracross is happy to join his team!\nSource: Official Website",
