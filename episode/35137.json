  "description" : "When the people of Israel approach the Promised Land of Jericho, they see a fortress city surrounded by impregnable walls. It is impossible for anyone to enter the city, thinks Joshua, the son of Moses. Then God`s messenger says to him, \"I will give you Jericho, its king, and his warriors. Walk around the city for seven days. Let seven priests blow trumpets made from rams` horns. The wall will collapse on the seventh day.\" So the people of Israel follow those words and begin to walk around the walls blowing the horns. Jericho`s army is puzzled at their behavior.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
