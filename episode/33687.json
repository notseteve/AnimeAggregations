  "description" : "Schubert, with the help of Reichwein, re-explores his past with Karl Neumann`s real mother and realizes his link to Johan. As news of Tenma`s arrest spreads, various people react with shock and horror, with the exception of Eva Heinemann, who is insistent that Tenma pay dearly for rejecting her. Suk tries to leave the hospital he is in to try to help Tenma, but is stopped by the Prague Police who inform him that Grimmer has sent a note to them exonerating Suk from any involvement of the deaths of the police officers. Runge also gets news of the arrest, but he is more interested in the Mansion of Red Roses, where he obtains a letter possibly addressed to the twins` mother. Tenma is deported back to Dusseldorf. \nSource: theTVDB.com",
