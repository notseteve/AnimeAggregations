  "description" : "As vice spread over the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, people are corrupted. God`s anger gradually leads to the destruction of these cities, which are full of decadence and blasphemy against God. Because Roto, his wife, and their two daughters are pious, they hear God`s voice saying \"Run away to the mountains, but never look back at the city.\" Roto`s wife, however, turns around as pandemonium breaks out in the ruined city. Then she turns into a pillar of salt as punishment for breaking a promise to God.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
