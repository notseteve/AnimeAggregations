  "description" : "At Kanade`s suggestion, the first \"Ikeda Lab Science-type Girls` Night Out\" is held at a family restaurant, but Himuro and Ibarada, who are both uncomfortable around people, start talking about their experiences of being all alone. Kanade attempts to liven up the mood with some girl talk about romance, asking Himuro what she likes about Yukimura, but Himuro then pulls out some documents and begins to analyze them in a matter-of-fact manner.\nLater, Kosuke attends a concert and waves his penlight furiously for Aika`s voice actress, Hinamori Ren. When he looks behind him, he sees Ibarada and Himuro!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
