  "description" : "Miyanishi was shot to death by Nakamura. During her interrogation, Nakamura testifies that Twenty Faces is actually Akechi. Determining that she may have been under his control, the police conduct a search of the Akechi Investigation Firm office. Hanasaki insists that Akechi can`t be Twenty Faces, and Inoue demands proof, but the police ignore them, and the Boy Detectives` Club are reminded of their own powerlessness. Meanwhile Akechi, now on the run, suspects there`s something more behind this incident and starts looking for the truth.\nSource: crunchyroll",
