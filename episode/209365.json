  "description" : "When Yuito used the star-sand gifted to him by Hitomi, he saw the golden fish. It was the one from the picture he drew in grade school that won him his first award. For some reason, Hitomi is fascinated by it. Incidentally, the Magic Photography Arts Club is doing a photoshoot at Glover Garden when the golden fish appears again and leads Hitomi into the world of a drawing.\nSource: Amazon",
