  "description" : "Eizouken’s so-called club room was merely a storage with holes in all sides. Therefore, fixing the room was a priority. Asakusa imagine the process as spaceship fixing training. To promote their club, they decided to create a new anime to show at the “budget decision committee meeting”. Three of them choose a scene from one of Asakusa’s many sketches. Asakusa wants to animate a tank while Mizusaki is persistent about actions. With her producer-like vision, Kanamori eggs on their creative energy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
