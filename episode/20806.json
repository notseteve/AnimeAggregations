  "description" : "Boss wants to see Bijou at the Ham-Ham Clubhouse. Bijou is reluctant to go, because she thinks that if her owner, Maria, returns before her, she`ll be sad if she sees her hamster has disappeared. Bijou learns she will return before her owner does, and finally arrives in the Clubhouse. Meanwhile, Laura accidentally gets splashed while carrying water. Travis gives her his towel and Laura dries off, then returns the towel. \nSource: Wikipedia",
