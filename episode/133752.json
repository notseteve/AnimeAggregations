  "description" : "Shana receives a response letter from Sophie Sawallisch about her report. Her words have made Shana felt uneasy and questions herself. She was able to figure it out during her training. Meanwhile Yuji officially arises as the new commander of Bal Masque, as Bel Peol announces their ambitions to all Guze no Tomogara that are present in Serei-den. Keisaku receives a spell from Margery that allows him to sense a nearby Tomogara as he heads off to Outlaw`s Tokyo Headquarters. On the train, he senses one but it appears to be in a train in the opposite direction. The other train arrives in Misaki City with Yuji getting off it.\nSource: Wikipedia",
