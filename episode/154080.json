  "description" : "Life with the six brothers becomes even stranger as Yui loses her appetite and becomes `marked` as Ayato`s possession. She is temporarily released from her duties as his personal plaything and sippy cup so she may get bathed. She enters the enormous bathroom to draw a bath for herself only to find Shu listlessly soaking in it, fully clothed. Then she learns to her sorrow that she doesn`t have a single ally in the entire household.\nSource: crunchyroll",
