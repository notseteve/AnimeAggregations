  "description" : "Isamu and Zo Zo Zombie encounter Hipster Zombie in the cemetery, and decide to have Zo Zo teach him the zombie ropes. They later learn he’s a know-it-all, and better off back underground, in his coffin. Zo Zo tries out Isamu’s new video game, but doesn’t go so well. Frustrated, he accidentally zombifies the game which comes alive and takes off leading a wild chase across the city! Zo Zo and Isamu find an empty cardboard box which turns out to be the sophisticated but highly irritable robot, Hakonosuke. They give him a donut as a peace offering which instead blows its fuses, and now its up to Professor Hanouri to fix it. Zo Zo and Isamu discover the wind they’re using for flying their kite is produced by a strange being: Kita! Kits teaches them about wind, and in exchange they introduce him to their own magic: donuts!\nSource: crunchyroll",
