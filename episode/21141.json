  "description" : "Kagemitsu suggests that Hyakkimaru become an officer, counting on his ability to defeat the fox goblin. Hyakkimaru, however, goes looking for Dororo, who has been thrown into the river after an unjustified lynching. There, he meets the woman who is his mother. Even though he does not know his mother`s face, he sees in the woman`s eyes total love and sorrow. Although they have lead separate lives, the bond between mother and her child reveals who they are in a flash. Hyakkimaru, however, turns his back on his mother. Meanwhile, a boy called Sukeroku saves Dororo on the other side of Banmon, and they become friends. Sukeroku explains the circumstances under which Banmon`s neighboring countries have come to hate each other. Both countries would still be friendly if it were not for the wall. Could they someday mend things between them? Sukeroku looks up at the wall while, beyond his gaze, Tahomaru is preparing his army for the launch of an all-out attack on the other side.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
