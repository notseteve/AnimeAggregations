  "description" : "Chipmunk believes that clouds make you feel hazy when they are overhead. He recalls feeling better one time when Bonobono came to play after a cloud passed by. Another time, a cloud passed overhead and Chipmunk sat down during his walk, and when the cloud passed, he got up and felt better. Raccoon challenges Chipmunk to prove that a cloud being overhead will make him feel hazy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
