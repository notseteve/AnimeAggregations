  "description" : "After a nearly eternal slumber, the all-powerful Zorc has resurrected, plunging the world into darkness!  Zorc has one goal: annihilate the world until there’s nothing left but an empty void!  The present era is not safe either, for if Zorc destroys the past in this Shadow Game, the present will be destroyed as well!  However, all hope is not lost because Yugi and friends have learned the Pharaoh’s name!  Unfortunately, Yami Bakura stops Yugi and challenges him to a duel where losing all your life points means losing your life!\nSource: crunchyroll",
