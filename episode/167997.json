  "description" : "After their failure to save Marsha before turning into a Wanderer, Isla and Tsukasa are told to take a break from field work until Isla is declared fit to return to such duties. She remains in android maintenance for several days to check and repair her injuries, and they are relegated to desk duty. She tells Michiru and Eru about how she can`t stop thinking about him, which they misinterpret as her being in love with him. They help her essentially stalk him until they are caught, and then Isla tells Michiru that she can`t stop thinking about him because she doesn`t understand how he can go on smiling despite the incident with Marsha, and wonders if he has forgotten about it already. Michiru tells her about how, against orders, he went to see Souta to personally apologise for their failure, and that it seems rather that he is unwilling to forget, and it seems he goes on smiling because he is sad.\nJust as Isla is released from maintenance Kazuki finally tells Tsukasa about how Isla is only a thousand hours away from the end of her service life. Isla passes nearby and hears their conversation. Kazuki gives him the choice of continuing his partnership with Isla or ending their partnership and waiting until another giftia is assigned to them. He declares that he wishes to remain with Isla until the end.",
