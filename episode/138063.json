The next day, Kuro asks her classmate, Sagimori Arata, a fan of Harue during her prime, who agrees to join the club. During Winter, Harue, whose company`s manga team has since become defunct, decides to visit Achiga for old time`s sake, where she is surprised to find Shizuno and the others playing.
