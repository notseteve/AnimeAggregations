While he is happy to finally be given the chance to perform on stage with his admired senpai, Otori, Hoshitani finds himself in an unusual slump when it comes to practicing the critical duet between Lambert and Alexis. No matter how many times they practice Hoshitani simply chokes in the middle of the song. His friends all assume it`s just nerves but when Hoshitani mysteriously goes missing one day mild concern turns into panic as they each split up to find him. Will Hoshitani be able to shake off this slump and take on his new role as Lambert?\nSource: crunchyroll",
