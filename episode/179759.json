  "description" : "Urara is in the doldrums.  What is a monster? Why is she fighting them?  She meets another reluctant monster who shares her concerns, but then when her friends show up they have to fight!  The monsters attack turns them into a manager who catches a girl shoplifting at the supermarket when her father comes to apologize, but he`s actually the manager`s ex-boyfriend and things get super-awkward.  Then they almost run out of air time! Can Urara transform without using a catchphrase to speed things up?\nSource: crunchyroll",
