  "description" : "Yui awakens in a lovely bed wearing a lovely nightgown, with no memory of how she came to be there dressed that way. As she ponders this, she finds herself suddenly surrounded by the five younger brothers who start to argue over dibs on her. The eldest arrives and curtly informs her she must get ready for night school. She is instructed to behave herself or to face punishment, but she is confused as to what being behaved entails as she is compelled to submit to Ayato`s every whim instead of attending class.\nSource: crunchyroll",
