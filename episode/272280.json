  "description" : "Yutaro sustains a heavy injury from Raijuta`s sword, and it is so severe that he will never be able to swing a sword with that arm ever again. Although Yahiko was constantly disagreeing with Yutaro until now, he understood very well what swordsmanship meant to him. He takes Yutaro`s hand and leads him out of the medical room, so they could witness the final battle between Kenshin and Raijuta.\nDeep in the night on a woodland path, Kenshin and Raijuta`s duel begins.\nSource: crunchyroll",
