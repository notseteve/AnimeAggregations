  "description" : "The four warriors appear before the king and present themselves before the king, who praises them for their renown and prowess in battle. The kingdom is in danger and they pledge to fight the evil that is threatening it. The Fighter however objects and asks for some funding to help them in their quest, but the king presents them with a measly ten gold pieces. They ask for some of the kingdom`s legendary weapons when he refuses to increase this, but he objects saying that those don`t exist. Ultimately the king is sufficiently insulted and has them thrown into the dungeons where they are tied up indecently.",
