  "description" : "In Part A, Hozuki faces off with his identically opposite foe, Hakutaku, as they go attend to small items of business with Hell`s gatekeepers who, incidentally, are also perfectly attuned with each other.\nIn Part B, It`s Sports Day in Hell, and everyone is welcome to join in, though attendance is mandatory. Hozuki puts his devious mind to the test creating all sorts of challenges that are specially designed to whip the softer minions into shape.\nSource: crunchyroll",
