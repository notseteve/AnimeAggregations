Growing tired of the power battle between the clans, Airi vows to bring in a one-two finish with Mizuo. Meanwhile, Kobayakawa from First High is injured in her match. Tatsuya discovers that someone had meddled with Miyuki’s CAD, and though it didn’t affect her, she is the only remaining athlete from First High to be able to compete in the match.
