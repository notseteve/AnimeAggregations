Back at the office, Fushihara is more worked up than usual. Knowing what day it is and having the image of Yuurei-chan and Myako looking fondly out at the koi fish streamers outside the window in her head, she`s determined to get all her work done early today. Meanwhile at the apartment, Yuurei-chan and Myako are plucking daisy petals, wishing for Fushihara`s safe return home.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
