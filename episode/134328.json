  "description" : "Two months after the main storyline, Rintaro, Daru, Mayuri, and Ruka are invited by Faris to come to Los Angeles, where she will participate in a Rai-Net tournament, reuniting with Kurisu upon their arrival. Due to Rintaro`s cancellation of Faris`s hotel reservations for them as a result of his ego, the group ends up checking into a motel. Later that night, Kurisu talks to Rintaro about the dreams she has had of past World Lines and the romance they shared. After visiting the card tournament Faris had entered, Rintaro spots someone that looks like Suzuha and chases after her, having a conversation in which she mentions that a fortune teller had foretold her having a child in seven years. After the girl leaves, Rintaro discovers that his phone is uncharged and he is almost broke, leading him to make his way back to the city on foot. He is eventually found by Kurisu, who becomes stranded with him after her car is found to be out of gas. While waiting to be rescued, the two discuss about the World Line where they confessed their love for each other, leading Rintaro to make his confession once again. \nSource: Wikipedia",
