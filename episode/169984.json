  "description" : "Nagare has suddenly showed up at the Kagami house while a live television show featuring her is about to air. Kagami convinces her to make a live streaming video performance at her old elementary school instead, which is also broadcast on television, saying that if she can`t do her own job well she has no right to criticise where others feel their place should be.\nAfter the show, Nagare explains to Kagami about why she wants Taki to quit her gang. On the day of Nagare`s audition to become an idol she had a sudden medical emergency, and Taki took the audition in her place. The idol producer was not fooled, but he accepted Nagare`s application anyway, but in exchange Taki made a promise not to associate herself in show business, and went on to Black Oracle Neo. Although Nagare made the best of it she always felt that she had taken the place that Taki should have had.\nKagami then brings Nagare to an underground Family Rangers fan event, where she in turn takes Taki`s place, and she manages to win. While she is changing out of her costume, she is abducted by some mysterious persons.",
