  "description" : "The Phantom Knight wavers when Tsuna`s determined stare reminds him of Yuni. He recalls a certain memory of when he had been ordered by Byakuran to annihilate the Giglionero Family but was too intimidated by Uri`s stare to do so. Byakuran is like a god to him, and he was deeply regretful of being unable to fulfill his wishes. The Phantom Knight tries to gain even more power from the ring in order to make up for his blunder. He lets the Hell Ring devour his mind, and he transforms into something horrifying. Just how powerful is the Phantom Knight?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
