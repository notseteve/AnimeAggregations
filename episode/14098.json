  "description" : "Shoryu and Rokuta run into each other in the underground maze of Ganboku Castle.  Rokuta smells blood in Koya, senses that Koya killed a man and feels sad.  When Gen State’s soldiers start cutting the dike in the upper reach of Rakusui River, the farmers in the area become angry and fight the state soldiers, then the king’s soldiers come to their rescue.  After ordering to cut the dike, Atsuyu completely loses trust by his officers.  When En-o shows up, Atsuyu shamelessly starts blaming others and begs for mercy.  When En-o gives him one and turns around, Atsuyu tries to kill him and gets killed.  En-o promises to Rokuta and Koya a rich and peaceful kingdom.\nSource: crunchyroll",
