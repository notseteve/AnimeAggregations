  "description" : "The Alvis top brass are searching for the place the Esperantos chose for the new settlement. There`s a chance it may be occupied by the enemy, but out of respect to the Esperantos` wishes, they`re determined to take it back if that is the case. Meanwhile, in the Tatsumiyajima burg, progress is being made with the improvement of the Zero Fafner. Siblings Rina and Akira are chosen yet again to pilot it, as their SDPs are expected to work in synergy with the Zero Fafner`s power.\nSource: crunchyroll",
