  "description" : "The Guardians go to a winter training camp and stay with Kukai`s grandfather, who is the priest at a temple near a ski resort. The Guardians enter a snow-sculpting contest, each building a part of a castle. However, Amu becomes discouraged with her gate. When Amu asks Miki to do a Character Change, Miki refuses. On the way back to the temple, Amu asks Tadase about the person he said he already liked when he rejected her. Tadase explains that he was referring to his family`s dog. Nevertheless, Tadase confesses that he has come to like Amu`s alter ego, Amulet Heart. That night, Amu becomes depressed that Tadase likes Amulet Heart, but that Amulet Heart is not her. Ran reminds Amu that Amulet Heart is Amu`s would-be self and that Amulet Heart exists within Amu. Amu then becomes determined to work towards becoming her would-be selves.\nSource: crunchyroll",
