  "description" : "Bertholdt thinks back to the Battle of Trost where he, Reiner, and Annie were forced to leave Marco to be eaten by Titans after he overheard the truth about them being Titans. In the present, the Armored Titan roars to signal the Beast Titan to throw the barrel containing Bertholdt into Shiganshina. Armin attempts to negotiate with him, but Bertholdt intends to kill everyone present. He transforms into the Colossal Titan, causing a massive fiery explosion that Hange`s squad gets caught in. With only five members of the Levi Squad remaining, Armin hesitates over attempting an attack or retreat as the Colossal Titan begins to advance.",
