  "description" : "In their search for the book of reincarnation, Gessho and Suusu find themselves under attack from various youkai, but one in particular, a spider youkai known as Seitou, has her own plans for the book. After she is powered up by a mysterious man, Seitou once again attacks the pair seeking the book. Suusu is left defenseless when Seitou appears to have done away with Gessho, but just as things look desperate, Suusu`s older sister, Yaya appears and things take a strange turn. The mysterious link between Suusu and Gessho only deepens, while Seitou seems to have some kind of tie to Oh Fuuki.\nSource: crunchyroll",
