  "description" : "Ohana starts a new school life with Minko and Nako. The girls bombard her with questions because she came from Tokyo, and the boys won`t stop bothering her because she lives with Minko, who just happens to be one of the most popular girls in school. Yuina Wakura, a fellow classmate and the successor to a famous hot spring inn, \"Fukuya,\" saves Ohana from the hassle. Ohana`s new school life starts out quite dramatically, and she later witnesses Minko being asked out by a boy behind the school building.\nSource: crunchyroll",
