  "description" : "Shortly after the battle against Ragyo, a graduation ceremony is held at Honnouji, which is due to be dissolved. The ceremony is interrupted by duplicates of Satsuki and the Elite Four wearing Junketsu and Goku Uniforms. As Ryuko and the real Elite Four fight the doppelgangers, the real Satsuki and Mako are held captive by the true culprit, Rei, who attempts to exact revenge on Satsuki for her treachery. Rei attempts to take control of a giant mech formed from Honnouji itself, but Mako manages to briefly override it, encouraging Ryuko and the Elite Four to defeat the clones. Ryuko is knocked down a pit by Rei, but she hears Senketsu`s voice and receives the Scissor Blades, managing to transmogrify them into an even larger blade and finally destroy the mech, while Satsuki convinces Rei to surrender peacefully. Afterwards, everyone bids their farewells to Honnouji as it sinks to the bottom of the sea along with the Scissor Blades, while Ryuko takes comfort knowing that Senketsu is always with her.",
