  "description" : "As Ganta Igarashi and his classmates plan for a class trip to Deadman Wonderland, a privately owned prison that also serves as an amusement park, a mysterious red man appears, killing his entire class and thrusting a red stone into Ganta`s chest. Being the only survivor out of the entire class, Ganta is charged with mass murder and, due to the overwhelming, and doctored, evidence against him and no way to prove his innocence, he is sentenced to death and sent to Deadman Wonderland`s prison. As some of the higher ups plot to kill Ganta in an `accident`, Ganta meets a strange white-haired girl named Shiro, who manages to read his heart and understand him. When a bunch of bullies start attacking Ganta and Shiro, an explosion causes a large object to fall towards Ganta. However, Ganta`s desire to keep living so he can kill the red man activates the powers that were implanted in him, allowing him to control his blood to save himself and Shiro.",
