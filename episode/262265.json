  "description" : "Mahiro loses to Mihari in a video game, so he has to do the grocery shopping this week as punishment. As an unemployed, good-for-nothing shut-in, the task at hand is daunting, but he plucks up the courage and makes his way towards the supermarket. The size of the crowd, however, makes his resolve waver and Mahiro finds himself cowering outside the store entrance. It is then that a young boy (?) around his age, wearing a baseball cap, comes to the rescue and offers him a helping hand. Thanks to the boy`s (?) help, Mahiro is able to buy the groceries he needs and is just about to head home, when Kaede suddenly shows up. Seemingly, out of nowhere.\nSource: crunchyroll",
