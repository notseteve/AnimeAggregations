  "description" : "Novelist Mikazuki Subaru has no interest in anything but books and can`t stand it when people interrupt his writing work. One day, by chance, he finds a stray cat and brings it home to live with him. As he watches the cat behave in ways he didn`t expect, Subaru comes up with all kinds of ideas for his latest novel.

Maybe this creature really is nothing but trouble?! But the cat has its own thoughts on the matter...\nSource: crunchyroll",
