  "description" : "I just wanted to protect her. That feeling wasn`t a lie. Where did I go wrong?\" Rejected by the one who meant more to him than anything, Subaru is still unable to recognize that he may have done something irreversible. He then finds out that some disturbing movement has been detected within Roswaal`s domain, where Emilia and the others are. He`s certain that he can save them somehow, so in spite of Rem and Crusch`s opposition, Subaru makes his way back to Emilia... Upon returning to Roswaal`s mansion, Subaru is greeted by an unbelievable sight and wails that this was not what he wanted to happen. Stricken with despair, everything before Subaru starts to go white as, finally, he hears a voice: \"You were too late.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
