  "description" : "Mom and Fumi are on their way home from having lunch near the train station when Fumi`s stomach starts to hurt. Telling her to hold it until they get home, Mom talks about her childhood experience of urgently needing a toilet. While watching \"Cinderella\", Bunji hits Fumi with simple questions. Fumi`s answers are curt. Unconvinced, Bunji extends the topic to a picture book of \"Momotaro\"...  Bunji says he will take his bath by himself. Thinking that maybe he is growing up a little, Mom is impressed, but it seems he isn`t warming himself properly. Wondering why, she peeks into the bath one day... Having rushed out to bring in the laundry after a sudden shower, Mom blows her top at Dad, Bunji, and Fumi when they won`t help her at all.\nSource: crunchyroll",
