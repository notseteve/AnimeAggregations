  "description" : "Bofurin is able to defeat every member of Natori-led KEEL and safely rescue Nagato. \"Nagato was kind and gentle, but he was strong.\" What happened to Nagato? He explains everything to Sakura, Anzai, and the others. On the way back, Sakura expresses his true feelings, watching as Nirei regains consciousness while Tsugeura carries him. In response, the other first-year class 1 students also begin to speak. As he watches over this scene, Kaji reveals a mysterious and deep expression toward the KEEL group. It`s a magnificent climax for the KEEL arc!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
