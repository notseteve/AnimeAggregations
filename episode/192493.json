  "description" : "The first game since Kurokan`s return is against his old ally Morioka. This gets the attention of a lot of reporters which makes the Washinomori players even more nervous.\nWhile the Washinomori`s ninth player   Sakamoto   is rushing to the game, Kirino is warming up with remarkable skills that scares Washinomori. \nSakamo finally arrives and he throws a perfectly accurate long pass in the outfield during warm-up. \nKurokan also shows off with what is called Japan`s first vertical super flying ball. Everyone is amazed.\nSource: crunchyroll",
