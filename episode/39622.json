  "description" : "The Star Force dispatches its new runabout craft, the CosmoHound, to identify the reflection system of the reflex gun. The Argo destroys the Galman planes that are serving as reflector satellites, and destroys the Galman base on the planet, from which Dagon flees. Wildstar decides that the mission is becoming too dangerous, and orders almost all the female members of the crew to return to Earth on a transport vessel. \n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
