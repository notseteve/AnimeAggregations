  "description" : "The student council has requested Yamada and Miyamura to visit a truant student named Sarushima. It turns out that she is another witch, with the ability to see the future, and stopped coming to school because she saw a vision of her causing a fire in the old school building. She kisses Yamada, who receives her powers, and they understand that the visions are from someone kissed. Yamada finds out that Sarushima earlier kissed another transfer student named Tsubaki. Yamada finds him, and learns that he has a crush on Shiraishi, and that he likes to fry tempura in the old school building whenever he is depressed. He is thus evidently the direct cause of the fire in the visions.\nTo prevent the fire from happening, Yamada tries to swap bodies with Tsubaki, but he resists. He returns to Tsubaki in Shiraishi`s body, bringing him out on a date in an attempt to stall for time, but before Tsubaki can confess his love, Shiraishi comes out and kisses him. This would have changed the future such that Shiraishi becomes blamed for the fire instead, but Yamada manages to stop Tsubaki from his cooking.",
