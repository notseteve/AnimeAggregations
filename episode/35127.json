  "description" : "Other countries persistently start wars against Israel to defeat Saul`s army. As Saul claims one after another victory, he gains respect from his people, but he eventually becomes arrogant. In the end, he spends all his time fighting. Then Philistine`s army follows closely behind Saul and his sons, and kills his sons first. Then Saul, in despair, props up his sword on the ground and throws himself on it. The sword pierces him and he dies.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
