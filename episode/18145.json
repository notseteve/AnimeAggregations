  "description" : "A very sad episode indeed. After a trap last set by Dr. Eggman, Chris is held captive in E-99 on the shores while Sonic is trying his hardest to defeat it and get Chris back. However, with the power of seven Chaos Emeralds, it`s not that easy. Sonic is bruised and beaten... badly. Chris can`t stand the sight of his hero beaten up, and actually breaks himself free to grab the emeralds and jump in the water to help Sonic. Behold! Super Sonic rises out and destroys E-99, and then a blast of Chaos Control is released, as Station Square watches in awe.",
