  "description" : "Sakura was feeling a little down about her skills as a Cardcaptor, so Rika and I decided to take her shopping and try to cheer her up! But the second Rika put on the sword shaped brooch she`d bought, she got taken over by the Sword card and turned against us! Being careful not to hurt her spellbound friend, Sakura cleverly used her Illusion card to seal Sword back in the Clow Book and return Rika back to normal.\nSource: crunchyroll",
