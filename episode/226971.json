  "description" : "Mazama Jin here. I`m on track to set a perfect attendance record at Seton Academy. It`s always difficult to keep yourself at just the right amount of distance, isn`t it? Sometimes you`re too close, sometimes too far. In my case, Hitomi-chan always comes close to me in front of the others. You shouldn`t do that! When you`re not sure how much distance is appropriate, one thing you can try is to look from the viewpoint of a third party. I`m a little bewildered at myself for thinking of givng that advice... because the ones struggling with the right distance are a stupid tarsier and a stupid naked mole-rat.\nSource: crunchyroll",
