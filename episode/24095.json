  "description" : "Triton becomes friends with the boy Butcha who lives on an island near Dolphin Island. When Butcha brings Triton to his island, his grandfather cries out in surprise to see Triton wearing a red cloak. Then he tells Triton to leave the island. There is a legend on this island: when somebody wearing a red cloak appears, a big tsunami will strike the island. And just like the legend, a big tsunami strikes the island and sinks it into the sea. This is Doriate`s way of getting at Triton.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
