  "description" : "Takemoto views the map the night before he starts traveling the next morning. He comes across a store near a school, and ends up eating sweet rolls. The store owner talks to him about her time in America, offering him some corn for the trip afterward. Takemoto reminisces about the time he wished he could go to America with his father. Not paying attention, he falls off his bicycle, but manages to get back on and continues on his journey back to the apartment. When he arrives home, he goes to see Hagu. Professor Hanamoto goes to see Hagu shortly after, but finds out that both Takemoto and Hagu are asleep. Takemoto wakes up the next morning and receives a warm welcome from everyone. Takemoto explains to them that he was simply trying to go on a journey, meeting people along the way. It is revealed that Takemoto has been away for two months. Everyone goes to a harvest festival, and they all see the fireworks. After realizing that what he leaves behind can mean so much to him, Takemoto admits his love for Hagu. As Takemoto spends the night with all friends in the apartment, a four-leaf clover is secretly shown next to his bicycle. \nSource: Wikipedia",
