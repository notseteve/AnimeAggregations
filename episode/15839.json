  "description" : "Tai goes to find his parents and to free the people at the convention center. Izzy receives an email from Gennai telling him how to set up a program on his computer that will stop the evil digimon from finding them. This program ends up saving Tai and his parents. MegaSeadramon attacks Joe and T.K., but Ikkakumon digivolves into Zudomon and defeats the monster. They find Wizardmon in the water with the eighth child`s crest. Phantomon shows up and calls two other digimon to attack Sora and Matt. Kari thinks that if she gives herself up to Myotismon, Phantomon will leave them alone, so she gives herself up and Phantomon carries her off.\nSource: crunchyroll",
