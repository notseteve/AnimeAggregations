  "description" : "As the Nahel Argama rushes toward Industrial 7, its course is blocked by Sleeves mobile suits. Unless it can break through the enemy lines, Full Frontal will be allowed to obtain Laplace`s Box. Also standing in the way is Riddhe`s Banshee Norn, which confronts Banagher`s Full Armor Unicorn Gundam. Meanwhile, Bright learns from Kai Shiden that an operation is under way to activate the Gryps 2 colony laser and annihilate the Box, and he hurries in the Ra Cailum to the Cheyenne base where the control center is located. Riddhe, trapped by a blood curse, begins running wild. Despite her injuries, Marida comes to the rescue in the Kshatriya Repaired, and orders Banagher to go on ahead.\nSource: crunchyroll",
