  "description" : "\"Get it? I do see you as a rival.\"\nWith limited experience as a dancer, Gaku struggles during rehearsals for the Tsukihana Kagura play. Ruka, however, dances effortlessly. Gaku knows that Ruka has always had a knack for picking up new skills quickly. While Gaku admires that talent, it also makes him feel a little inadequate. One day after rehearsals, when Ruka asks Gaku to go home together, Gaku lies and makes an excuse to continue practicing alone. When Ruka later realizes that Gaku lied to him, he starts to wonder if his own awkwardness toward Gaku about the `rival` issue is the reason Gaku is avoiding him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
