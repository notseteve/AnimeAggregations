  "description" : "Hyoga is confused as to why Hägen can withstand the heat. Hägen received his God Robe in that place and has trained there since childhood, mastering both ice and fire techniques. As Hyoga tried to see through Hägen`s technique, he is continuously overpowered and knocked down, but still manage to stand up and asks for the Odin Sapphire. Both attack each other again, but Hyoga falls unconscious. Just as Hägen is about to throw Hyoga into the lava, Freya arrives and tries to tell him about Hilda and the Nibelung Ring. However, Hägen still believes Freya is being manipulated. Hägen is about to attack, but Freya stands in his way, refusing to move. He reluctantly launches his technique, but Hyoga saves her in time. Hägen and Hyoga attack once again with Great Ardent Pressure and Aurora Execution, but Hyoga awakens the Seventh Sense and overpowers Hägen, killing him. Kiki arrives as Freya mourns Hägen`s death, and Hyoga mentions that this is a sorrowful battle they are forced to fight.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
