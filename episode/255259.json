  "description" : "The training camp comes to an end. Ryo and the other first-years head to Akira`s home for an after party and barbecue. Later, they head to a fireworks display with Ayumi and her friends. Ryo and Sakaki become separated from the others while visiting the food stands. Now that they`re alone together, Ryo works up the courage to bring up a subject that`s been bothering him: the fuzzy topic of dissolving their doubles team. Ryo wants to know how Sakaki really feels, but Sakaki dodges the question and refuses to face Ryo.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
