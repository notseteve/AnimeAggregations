  "description" : "Having saved a second life and revealed herself to Ryouta as a \"Witch\" (a description that Ryouta does not think to be very accurate), Kuroha considers her job done and doesn`t return to school. She feels that any further contact with her will put Ryouta in further danger.\nRyouta`s teacher sends him to deliver printouts to the absent Kuroha, but there is no house at the provided address. Ryouta tracks down Kuroha`s hideout, and discovers quite a bit more than he`d expected. Kuroha returns to school, and another life hangs in the balance.\nMeanwhile, a sinister military group has captured a witch and her human friend, with dire consequences.",
