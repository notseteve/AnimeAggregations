  "description" : "Sorata Arisugawa and Arashi Kishu find Syaoran, Fai, Kurogane, and Sakura (still unconscious but better) and take them to their apartment building. After some rest and less suspicious clothes, the three go around town looking for Sakura`s memory fragments. However, Kurogane spots someone who looks like Princess Tomoyo and chases after her. After losing sight of the girl as well as Syaoran and Fai, Kurogane meets the gang from before and a fight ensues.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
