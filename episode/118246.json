  "description" : "Ringo’s class mate, Saotome Koutarou, missed a day of school because of a cold. However, rumor has it that he stayed home to practice for a violin recital. On their way home, Ringo and her friends keep talking about Saotome. When someone mentions that he’s aiming to become a pro, they get in a frenzy and say “He’ll be a celebrity!” and “We should get autographs while we still can!”. But soon they realize that an unfamiliar voice has joined the conversation. The mysterious rabbit who had helped them before was back. His name is “Chris”. Chris says that he’s come from Fairy Land, and that he will help Lil’Pri gather Happiness Tones. Then Chris pulls something out from a bush and gives it to Ringo. That something was a violin case with the name “Saotome” on it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
