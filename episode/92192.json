  "description" : "\"Summer vacation has begun and finally, it’s time for what Haruka has been waiting for, Comike! \nOf course Nobunaga is all ready to go, and says he’ll head over there on the earliest train. It’s a huge difference compared to Yuuto and Haruka, who plan to leave at 9 am. \nOn the day of the event, Yuuto is completely blown away by the crowd, way worse than rush hour traffic, and the insanely long line of people. Haruka, too, is surprised by the crowd, but is more excited about the various doujinshi that she’s been after. The two head straight toward Haruka’s first choice, the super famous circle, but they also have a crazy long line. Will Haruka be able to get her favorite book!?\n\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
