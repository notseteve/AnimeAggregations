  "description" : "Natsuru is surprised to find his childhood friend Mikoto has returned. When Kämpfer Natsuru heads to school, she is forced to participate in a `quasi-maid café`. She is later accompanied by Shizuku, who warns her that a new Kämpfer will be coming. Kaede later joins them, and Shizuku subtly probes her to see if she has any knowledge concerning the Kämpfer and the Entrails Animals that spawn them. Kaede asks Natsuru for a kiss, but she declines and settles for a date around the festival instead. As they enter into a haunted house, Natsuru is attacked by a new Red Kämpfer, whom Natsuru eventually recognizes as Mikoto. Akane later intervenes and the fight is stopped by Shizuku, who asks Natsuru and Akane to reveal their true identities to her. After everyone gets on the same level, Shizuku agrees on a truce, as she wants to find out something. As Natsuru apologizes to Kaede for abandoning her, Kaede asks her to spend the night at her house. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
