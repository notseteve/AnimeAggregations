  "description" : "Melmo is chosen to play the leading role for \"Snow White\" at the upcoming school festival. Nitako, who is from a very rich family, is also eager to play that role. Although Nitako is eventually cast as the stepmother who bullies Snow White, she works out a scheme with her mother to take the role from Melmo. Even on the very day of the play, Nitako has not yet given up on her idea. She changes her lines as she likes, and persistently bullies Snow White. In the meantime, having stolen Melmo`s candies, Nitako`s mother threatens Melmo that she will not give back the candies unless Melmo surrenders the role of Snow White to Nitako.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
