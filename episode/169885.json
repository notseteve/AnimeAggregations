She believes that a JASDF pilot, Atsuzawa, is responsible for her father`s death, but Atsuzawa says it`s the work of a monster. Eventually, Atsuzawa feels the same pressure he felt when he saw the monster in the sky that day he saw the monster. Right after, Ushio and the others come face to face with the monster that brought down Yuu`s father`s plane, Fusuma.\nSource: crunchyroll",
