  "description" : "Xanadu has been created, albeit with some slight changes. Midnight comes, and the Midnight Lost Child activates, replenishing the God of Creation`s powers. Yuji has the chance to undo Shana`s changes to his new world, but decides to let it stand, as the Denizens tell him they are willing to give up eating humans if they no longer need to. The God of Creation announces his new world for the Crimson Denizens and allow them to live there in peace. He parts with Yuji and they go their separate ways, when the God of Creation makes note of his respect towards Yuji. The God of Creation says that the Flame Haze should rejoice now that the war is over. All remaining members of Bal Masqué leave for Xanadu except for Sydonay who stays behind willing to aid Yuji in his final confront against Shana, while Khamsin`s friends gather around him to pay their respects to him before he dies. Kazumi promised to never forget him.\nSource: Wiki",
