  "description" : "A cold is spreading at the Smile Snack House, and most of the hostesses have taken sick leave. An important customer is coming the next day, but Otae is the only one at the shop in good health. Desperate to round up some hostesses, the store manager asks Gintoki and the gang to bring in some cute girls. But everyone aside from Kagura is unenthusiastic about it. Just then, Kyubei comes in to the shop with refreshments for Otae.\nSource: crunchyroll",
