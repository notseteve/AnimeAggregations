  "description" : "Set between episodes two and three during Golden Week, Yuri arranges for the SSS to go on a deadly picnic, which involves most of the members trying to kill each other with various traps and gadgets. Sensing an opportunity, Girls Dead Monster members Irie and Sekine conspire to kill Iwasawa and seize control of the band from her. As the boys largely fall victim to various traps, leaving just Otonashi alive, Irie and Sekine attempt to lead Iwasawa into various pitfalls, but she survives each one while remaining completely oblivious. With Shiina`s help, they attempt to use their last trap, a dreadful concoction of raw liver, but it instead lands on Hisako, who transforms into a bloodthirsty monster that not even Tenshi can stop. Sometime later, Irie and Sekine explain the events of the picnic to Yui and how they inspired the band to take on their current name.\nSource: EN Wikipedia",
