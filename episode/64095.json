  "description" : "Uryu is severely injured by Nieder`s attack but tries desperately to counterattack, though his weapon seems to have run out of power. Yoshi thoroughly revels in the fight in the Soul Society because she can do whatever she wants. Uryu seeks clues in an attempt to counterattack Yoshi. In the meantime, the Soul Reapers discuss what they will do after Kariya takes away the Jokai Crest, which has the power to destroy the Seireitei. The situation does not look good, and some captains no longer believe the fight.\nSource: crunchyroll",
