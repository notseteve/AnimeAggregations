  "description" : "Saybil is a remedial student studying magic at the Royal Academy. Strangely, he has no memory of his life before the academy. What`s worse, his grades are so bad that the other students think he`ll be expelled. But if he flunks out, he`ll lose his memories of the academy, too. In order to hold on to the only life he can remember, he sets out on a dangerous journey with the Dawn Witch Loux Krystas as his school-appointed escort. Can he find a way to succeed where he has always failed before?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
