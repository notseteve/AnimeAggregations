  "description" : "At the order of the council of elders that manages Lugunica in the king`s absence, Wilhelm and Felis visit Roswaal`s mansion as emissaries. Emilia is required in the imperial capital right away, so Subaru asks her to take him along. Emilia tells him this won`t be a pleasure trip, but a push from Rem and Roswaal ends in her agreement, so Emilia and Subaru head to the capital. Now all of the candidates to be Lugunica`s next king are gathered, and the royal selection is underway.\nAs Emilia joins Priscilla, Crusch, and Anastasia in a meeting of the royal selection participants, Reinhard enters the hall with Felt. According to a new prophecy seen on the Dragon Stone, there are five priestesses with the potential to be the kingdom`s next ruler. Reinhard announces that Felt is the fifth priestess, meaning it`s time to formally begin the royal selection, but Felt refuses to have any part in it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
