  "description" : "Matsudaira summons Kondo, Hijikata, and Okita to the Ikedaya and informs the three of them that “You-know-who” is finally making his move. As tension runs high in the room, Matsudaira further declares it’s time for a “showdown.” Kondo and the others pledge their assistance to Matsudaira without really knowing whom this “You-know-who” is. When they find themselves at the amusement park and see a flirtatious man named Shichibei meet Kuriko, Matsudaira’s daughter, they realize Matsudaira is plotting to assassinate the man toying with his beloved daughter. Appalled by all of this, Hijikata decides to leave, but Kondo and Okita join in on the gig. And so begins the dramatic yet sad battle of men on a stake-out, ready to break up a couple’s date.\nSource: crunchyroll",
