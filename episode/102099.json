  "description" : "While Nagi`s heart was healing and Hayate gave her some space, of all places, why did he stay with Hinagiku? Is there something developing there? Maria was worried about Hayate`s whereabouts so she sneaked into Hakuo Academy in disguise. She took the elevator to the student council when she saw Hayate and it was just the two of them. Hayate wouldn`t expect to see Maria at the Academy so he didn`t recognize her. Therefore, she took this as a good opportunity to get things out of Hayate when the elevator suddenly stopped! The two of them are stuck in a confined space when they make a promise?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
