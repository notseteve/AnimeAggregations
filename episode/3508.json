  "description" : "While capturing the Change card, Kero and Xiaolang accidentally switched bodies, and had to send an entire day as each other before the spell could be undone. Neither one of them was good at impersonating the other, so I figure out what happened right away. Just as we were getting ready to leave school, Mr. Terada mistook Xiaolang (in Kero`s body) for a stuffed animal, so we went to the toy store to get him back. Unfortunately, Xiaolang was in the crane game, so Kero had to win him so they could switch back.\nSource: crunchyroll",
