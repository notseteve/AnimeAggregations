  "description" : "When Amu makes a high school boy, Yugaku Iwagaki, angry, she gets more than she bargained for as he chases the female Guardians all around the school. Amu later finds a deer figurine and puts it into the Lost and Found. After the chase, the female Guardians return to the Royal Garden, finding Kukai and Tadase in female school uniforms due to Nagihiko (Kukai asked Nagihiko what it was like in a skirt and angered him). The figurine earlier found belonged to Yugaku, who is not only a strong karate student, but also has a love for anything cute. Easter is studying Ikuto`s violin and they want to put X Egg energy into it. Lulu comes by to the Iwagaki dojo and takes advantage of his love for cute things, turning his Heart`s Egg to a Mystery Egg. When Amu comes by, Yugaku Character Transforms to Fancy Dream and makes a mess of the dojo. Amu and Rima transform to Amulet Spade and Clown Drop, but after being outnumbered, Su switches in, becoming Amulet Clover. Clearing up misunderstandings, Amu performs Open Heart to purify him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
