  "description" : "Amu and her Guardian Characters are watching Utau sing on television when El shows up. She tells them that Utau needs more people to go to her concert so she can get popular again. Amu shows up, but Utau won`t listen to her. Amu decides to try and bring Ikuto there. Utau begs Amu, and Amu finds Ikuto. She begs Ikuto to play his violin there, but he refuses. Amu doesn`t know that he lost it until he tells her. Ikuto then tricks her, saying that he`ll listen if she asks more sweetly. Amu stomps away embarrassed and angry, then tells Utau he couldn`t come. Yukari then entrusts Amu to send out fliers. Meanwhile, Ikuto tries to get his violin back, but ends up getting caught and hurt. Amu has no luck sending out fliers, until Tadase, Rima, and Yaya appear. El appears out of nowhere and transforms into Amulet Angel, using Angel Wink to attract some boys to give fliers to. Tadase, Rima, and Yaya also Character Transform to help pass out fliers. Eventually, they get many people to come. Utau sings \"Heartful Song\", and is still sad that Ikuto couldn`t come until she sees Ikuto. She smiles and continues to sing. Amu spots Ikuto and tries to catch up with him, but he leaves before she could thank him. Ikuto smiles because he had heard Utau sing.\nSource: crunchyroll",
