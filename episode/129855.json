  "description" : "Ganta is thrusted into his Corpse Carnival match with Crow and is at a disadvantage as his projectiles use too much blood and cause him to develop anemia. As he becomes helpless, he recalls memories of Shiro and manages to stand back up, using the environment to get a hit on Crow. After escaping from the corridor, You and Shiro head towards G-Block after You hears the whereabouts of a women he is searching for. After Ganta recovers from his victory, he is horrified to find that Crow is forced to have one of his eyes removed as a result of losing. As You uses Shiro as a diversion so he can escape on his own, he bears witness to her true destructive ability, as she herself has the Branches of Sin.",
