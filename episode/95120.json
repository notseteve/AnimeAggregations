  "description" : "Yua comes to Takumi`s class and he runs away screaming. Takumi is found by Rimi near the courtyard and finally agrees to allow Rimi to support him and he begins walking to and from school with her. After school, Takumi and Rimi go to a café and he begins to fill her in on his encounter with Shogun. At this time, a protest against the New Generation events passes by the café. Back at his place Takumi tries to call upon his real Di-Sword while holding the fake one, but Rimi stops him. Rimi leaves to get more soda, and while she is gone Takumi finds out that his old psychiatrist has been killed as the victim of the fifth New Generation incident. Meanwhile, Sena destroys a device made by the Nozomi Technology Group in someone`s backpack. The next day, Takumi learns more about finding his Di-Sword from Ayase. After school, Rimi walks Takumi home and he tries to tell her about his possible power to make delusions real but she does not believe him. Ban goes to see Momose Katsuko to learn more about the New Generation events. Meanwhile, Takumi apparently gets a call from Shogun, but when he answers it all he hears is a strange tune, the one from the pedestrian scramble and street crossings, and then suddenly a strange earthquake hits Shibuya with a very loud alarm-like noise and causes the sky to momentarily turn white. \nSource: Wikipedia",
