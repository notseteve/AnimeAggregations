  "description" : "The Varia win the main battle in Italy, and all that is left is to defeat the boss, Byakuraun. While Tsuna and his friends are in high spirits, Byakuran sends a message via hologram as though to mock them. In a confident tone, Byakuran asks for a formal measuring of the Vongola’s strength against the Millefiore. However, the Millefiore’s main force has already been defeated by Tsuna and his friends at the Merone Base. Irie is having trouble recognizing his true intentions when her Mare ring breaks! And then a new enemy appears before Tsuna and his friends.\nSource: crunchyroll",
