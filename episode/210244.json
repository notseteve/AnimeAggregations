  "description" : "After the dice game match on Prison Gate Island, Seimei`s body suddenly starts floating in the air and emitting a strange light. Swallowed by the light, Takasugi awakens to find himself in a familiar place, the castle town of Hagi in Ansei year 5. There he is reunited with his beloved teacher, Yoshida Shoin, and his fellow students, Kusaka Gentan and Ito Shunsuke. Meanwhile, Katsura, having been swallowed up by the same light, encounters Seimei in that light. When Takasugi is pulled in by the light again he is dropped further in time, to the year of Yoshida Shoin`s execution. Takasugi believes that this is his chance to finally save his teacher, but things take a dramatic turn and Takasugi learns something that leaves him trembling with unsteady emotion.\nSource: crunchyroll",
