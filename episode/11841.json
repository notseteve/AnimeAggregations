  "description" : "After being blasted away by Dynasmon`s attack, the kids awake to find themselves on the blue moon, one of the three moons above the Digital World. They hitch a ride with a Starmon to a space station where SuperStarmon leads the Starmon in a large operation. After KendoGarurumon tries and can`t escape, they learn there is a force field surrounding the moon preventing their exit. The kids, along with the help of SuperStarmon, the Hamburgermon, and the Meteormon, construct a rocket that worthy of flight. As they launch, they can`t quite make it so Takuya evolves to BurningGreymon and gives them the extra boost needed. As they arrive back on the Digital World, they prepare to face the Royal Knights once more.\nSource: crunchyroll",
