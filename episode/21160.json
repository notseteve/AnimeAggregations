  "description" : "Kiyo and Zatch continue their battle with Grisor. During the battle, Hakase explains the true origins of the mirror; the mirror was stolen by Grisor for the Mamodo battles but during his travel to the human world, it broke into three pieces and scattered across the world. An attack from Grisor knocks Zatch unconscious. As he prepares to knock Kiyo and Zatch into the magma, Shion knocks the mirror out of Hakase`s hands cracking it. Zatch regains consciousness and uses \"Bao Zakeruga\" to defeat Grisor and the mirror is destroyed in the process. The next day, Shion decides to move in order to become a stronger person without being completely dependent on a person for help.",
