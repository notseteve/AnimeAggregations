  "description" : "While Saori tries to keep the polar caps from melting, Kiki and Freya stayed behind to look after her. The Bronze Saints head for different paths. While Shiryu looks for his next opponent, Capricorn Shura`s spirit reminds him to protect Athena. It is revealed that when Shiryu used his Final Dragon, Shura loaned his Gold Cloth to him and pushed him back to Earth, with his last words telling him to live on and to protect Athena. At the Valhalla Palace, Siegfried tells Hilda he is confident about his strategy to defeat the Bronze Saints. At a frozen waterfall, Shiryu is suddenly attacked by a pack of wolves, sent by the God Warrior, Alioth Fenrir of the Epsilon star. However, he defeats them with his Rising Dragon. Enraged, Fenrir goes to fight Shiryu, fully confident that he will win. After attacking Shiryu multiple times with his Wolf Cruelty Claw, Fenrir slashes Shiryu`s eyes, almost blinding him. Shiryu attacks with his Rising Dragon, but Fenrir is able to dodge it effortlessly and prepares to kill Shiryu.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
