  "description" : "The final character is written and Mana is complete as a vessel. Nanashi, who is using Mana, has obtained unimaginable power. With that power, both human and youkai alike are dragged to oblivion. Unable to fight it, humans and youkai fall victim one after another. Kitaro is unable to do anything in the face of such overwhelming power. Daddy Eyeball protects him and is swallowed by oblivion as a result. Completely at a loss, Kitaro simply stands there in a daze. Ratman appears, raises his fist, and knocks Kitaro flying.\nSource: crunchyroll",
