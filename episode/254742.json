  "description" : "During the cultural festival, Izumi-kun and Kamiya-san have a good time chatting as they share library duty. Then Nekozaki suddenly comes along and takes Kamiya-san away to see Shikimori-san. When Kamiya-san hears what Shikimori-san wants from her, she readily agrees. Later, when Kamiya-san returns to her classroom to help with her class`s festival project, her elegant look draws a crowd of classmates and guests around her. As she drowns in all the noise, a certain someone suddenly comes to mind, and she breaks away from the classroom.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
