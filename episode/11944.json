  "description" : "Maki and Kai will have real Fukamichi Ranking battles. Fukamichi gives them both locators to find the other person, to be worn on their wrists. Though it`s an incredible device to help you locate your opponent, Maki can`t figure out how to work it at all! Fukamichi is amazed how dull she is besides for her fighting skills. Though she can`t figure it out, she ends up in a dilapidated building. The locator shows her opponent is close by and then he shows up! His name is Koji Ogata. He`s dressed oddly and his unusual movements confuse Maki. His attack style is Ninjutsu! Maki can`t figure out his attacks and his being hit over and over. Fukamichi sees this and says, \"For Maki Aikawa, it`s only a matter of time.\" Like he`s signaling the final blow, Ogata sends out this shrill whistle sound. Maki continues to be hit. Then, Ogata begins to look like multiple people! Is that possible?! Maki`s in trouble!\nSource: crunchyroll",
