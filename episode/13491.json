  "description" : "Aphrodite attacks Shun with his “piranhian Rose” and destroys Shun’s chain attack with ease. Aphrodite punishes Shun with his gold saints’s powers, destroying his bronze armour and almost fatally wounding him. Realising he must act quickly, Shun summons all of his remaining energy and attacks Aphrodite with his “Nebular Stream” technique. This allows Shun to defeat Aprodite, but not before suffering the spell of Aphrodite’s “White Rose” attack. The white rose attacks Shun’s heart and sucks out all of the blood out of his body. Shun is the latest of the bronze saints to fall, but what about Seiya? Is he dead, or just sleeping? Arles believes that he has won; he believes the only threat to his rule was the bronze saints… but he was wrong! Marin and Shina are planning to rescue Seiya on their own, but will they be able to save him in time to save Athena as well?\nSource: crunchyroll",
