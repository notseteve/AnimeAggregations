  "description" : "Bird has loaded the orbital base of the Space Elevator with explosives, and is threatening to ram it down onto Tokyo.  If it lands, it will destroy the city along with most of Japan.  To stop it, Unit 8 and the USDF concoct a daring plan that involves the use of willwear in space.  Kuroki and Miho volunteer for this dangerous mission, and the rest of Unit 8 works together to get them up into orbit.  When they arrive, however, they find that Bird has laid one final trap: a trio of deadly autonomous willwear.  When Miho is knocked away from the satellite, Kuroki is forced to engage them alone. Can he defeat the enemy willwear and save the city that Inagi loved!?\nSource: crunchyroll",
