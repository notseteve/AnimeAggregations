  "description" : "A transfer student has joined Harumi`s class at school - his name is Gorou Goro. He is also not quite what he seems, as beneath his cover as a transfer student, he is in fact a spirit that will turn anyone who touches him into a ball!\nOf course, Harumi and the others end up touching him and rolling all over - but the biggest problem is that the ball changing is contagious, and if something isn`t done soon all of Japan, even the whole world might end up as balls! Even Enma-kun and Yukiko-hime end up as balls while trying to stop the spirit...\nEventually Yukiko-hime rolls off toward a hotter area than she can take... so hot that it could even be life threatening for the ice princess - will Enma-kun be able to save her before it`s too late?\nSource: Official Site",
