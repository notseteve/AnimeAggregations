  "description" : "As the POG breaks apart following Rook`s outburst, Kaito is contacted by Rook, who asks to spend some time with him in a surprisingly friendly manner. After a seemingly normal day of hanging out together, Rook challenges Kaito to a fight to the death so that he can unlock the God Scrolls he has in his possession. As Kaito agrees to go with him to the island of Kaika in the hopes he can save him as well, Baron and Gammon retrieve Jin whilst Bishop asks the help of Nonoha, Cubic and Souji to try and stop them.\nSource: Wikipedia",
