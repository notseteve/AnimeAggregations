  "description" : "SOX is scheming to rebuild various types of sex toys that have long been banned, based on descriptions in the stash of pornography they recovered, as well as others from oral tradition. They have Hyouka make a few remote control vibrators, and as Tanukuchi is getting ready to take them, Anna barges in, so he has to make excuses to her for why he is meeting with Hyouka. He says he was asking advice for a gift he was planning to give Anna, which she takes to be the vibrator, and he makes her think is a sort of a charm stone. She is happy to take it and later turns it into a pendant.\nThe next day, Anna calls them to the student council for a meeting, when the pendant/vibrator turns on unexpectedly. This drives her into a frenzy, and the remote control doesn`t seem to work, so he tries to escape and ask Hyouka to help fix it, which she cannot without the actual unit. Anna catches up to him, and he is driven into a corner and she embraces his lower half, the vibrator stimulating him nearly to the point of climax, but it breaks down just in the nick of time.",
