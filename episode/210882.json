  "description" : "Konrad makes a formidable foe with his giant lance. After a grueling fight, Seth finally defeats Konrad, but the collapse of the town has already begun by Hameline`s hand. When she attacks Seth, he is sent flying and loses consciousness. He awakes to find himself face-to-face with a man whose face closely resembles his own. The man calls himself Piodon and asks Seth what he`s fighting for, what side he`s truly on. Seth then rushes back to the battle to stop Hameline.\nSource: crunchyroll",
