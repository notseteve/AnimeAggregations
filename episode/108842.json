  "description" : "Duke Everlue is about to crush Lucy when Happy appears and ends his struggle. Lucy summons Cancer, her crab spirit. Oblivious to Natsu`s presence, Duke Everlue summons Virgo. Lucy and Cancer easily defeat him. They take the book back to Kaby, the son of the book`s author Zekua. Kaby explains that his father considered Daybreak to be the worst book he had ever written, and intends to destroy it to protect his father`s honor. However, Lucy reveals that the book contains a secret message for Kaby from his father as an apology for neglecting him over the years while writing the book for Everlue. To Lucy`s chagrin, Natsu and Happy respectfully decline the reward as Kaby does not have as much money as he claimed he would give.",
