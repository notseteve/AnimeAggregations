  "description" : "The Cannonball is launched, and Ichigo and company make it over Seireitai.  But because Ichigo is unable to control his spiritual power, they become stuck within the shakonaku (Soul Shield Membrane).  Ichigo and the others desperately try to collect their spiritual energy, but in that instant, the Cannonball explodes and everyone begins a descent towards Seireitei -- Ishida with Orihime, Chad, Yoriuchi, and finally, Ichigo with Ganju.  Ichigo and Ganju make a safe landing, but are confronted by Ikkaku and Yumichika, two Soul Reapers.\nSource: crunchyroll",
