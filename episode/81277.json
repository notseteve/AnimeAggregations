  "description" : "The second battle is between the Lightning Guardians. It is being held in the rain on a special field that spreads the lightning catches across the ground. Tsuna is worried about Lambo, his Lightning Guardian. He tries to get him to concede, but Lambo thinks it`s a game and steps onto the field. As soon as Lambo`s battle with Levi begins, lightning strikes the field and Lambo is struck with electricity, just as Tsuna was worried would happen. The battle appears as if it has already been decided. But Lambo`s special body structure prevents him from taking serious damage from the lightning.\nSource: crunchyroll",
