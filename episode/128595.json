Performing another experiment with the PhoneWave, which causes a burst of electricity when Mayuri opens it, Rintaro succeeds in sending another e-mail to the past. This leads Rintaro deduce that their PhoneWave is actually a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past. As Kurisu leaves the lab in denial, Rintaro hears about the Large Hadron Collider and micro black holes and asks Daru to hack into SERN. Later, after hearing from Titor about SERN allegedly creating a dystopian future, Rintaro and Daru learn that SERN have been performing top secret experiments with micro black holes, which have resulted in human deaths. \nSource: Wikipedia",
