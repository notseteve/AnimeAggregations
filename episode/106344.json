  "description" : "Lawrence and Holo make their way to the chilly port town of Renos, known for its wood and fur. As he enters the town, Lawrence is given a tablet to identify him as a foreign merchant, allowing him to trade in the town. Intrigued by the town`s history and legends, Lawrence decides to investigate. They settle into the local inn, where the innkeeper tells them about people who may be able to help them, including a man named Ligro, who was part of a strange gathering witnessed by Lawrence and Holo upon entering the town. They also meet a mysterious cloaked stranger, who Lawrence mistakes as male. Holo corrects him and jokingly chides him for having eyes for another woman.\nSource: Wikipedia",
