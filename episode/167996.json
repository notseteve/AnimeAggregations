  "description" : "Tsukasa tells the boys of the 1st Terminal Services Section that he is thinking of asking Isla out on a date. They have varied opinions but Yasutaka encourages him to do so. Isla meanwhile has been trying to do all sorts of things for Tsukasa that wind up causing trouble, such as cleaning his desk and also disposing of papers he was still working on, and he winds up having difficulty asking Isla, but in the end he finally succeeds and she agrees to go with him, after he tells her that while it might not make her more useful it would make him happy. Michiru and Eru repair the dress Tsukasa had given her and she uses it on the day.\nThey eventually decide to go to the amusement park, where Isla shows him the bench where she used to sit and watch people smile as they went by, where she sat with Kazuki. They enjoy themselves at the park until at the Ferris wheel Tsukasa suddenly collapses. When they are at home he explains how that seems to happen whenever he has to do something important. She tells him about how she has only about a month left, and he replies as he told Kazuki that he wants to be her partner until the very end.",
