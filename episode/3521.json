  "description" : "We got to hand out sweets and juice to everyone who attended the school`s bazaar. Of course, Kero showed up because he can`t stay away from tasty food! Somebody snuck through and ate all the sweets! We thought it was Kero, but he said that while he was hiding in the woods, he ran into a panther-like version of himself! The other Kero was named Supie. Since Kero is super nice, he invited Supie to share some treats with him, but then Kero discovered that Supie turns into a sweets vacuum when he has sugar! That`s what Kero claimed happened anyway.\nSource: crunchyroll",
