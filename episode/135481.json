  "description" : "Mato coerces Yomi into agreeing to go to a local festival, but Yomi is a no-show on the night of the event. Mato stands around waiting for hours until she at last receives a text message from Yomi, saying simply, “I’m sorry.” The next day, when Mato pays a visit to Yomi’s house, Yomi happens to see Mato from the window and is about to excitedly rush downstairs to meet her at the door, but Kagari injures herself to stop her. Right afterwards, Yomi accompanies Kagari to the hospital and continues to wait on her there. From behind the locked door, Mato cries out, “Let’s go home together!” to Kagari’s captive, Yomi. At the same time, in another world, the battle between Black★Rock Shooter and Chariot heats up!",
