  "description" : "Shadow Joker issues a phantom thief challenge to Joker! Unfortunately, Joker has caught a cold and can`t really compete... but to keep Shadow from mocking him, he sends a remote controlled mini-Joker doll along with Hachi to take his place. Shadow is disappointed, but along with Rose, tries to go through with the competition anyway. The treasure they`re after is the Jeweled Crocodile in the Kaneari Mansion, which is also the same place where Hachi and Joker first met!\nSource: crunchyroll",
