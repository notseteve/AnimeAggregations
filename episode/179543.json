  "description" : "When Abeno is hired to exorcise a yokai by a human, he unenthusiastically heads to the client`s house with Ashiya and Fuzzy.\nThe girl who hired him is unable to see yokai but is interested in the occult and seems very interested in their work. Abeno asks Ashiya to watch the door while he works so nobody bothers him, but the girl`s mother, who doesn`t believe in the supernatural, begins asking Ashiya some nosy questions.\nSource: crunchyroll",
