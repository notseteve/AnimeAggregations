  "description" : "Akane Kinoshita, a University student, was struck with tragedy when her boyfriend Takuma ended their relationship with the words, “I’ve fallen for someone else.” To make things even worse, it seems the other girl he fell for is someone he met through the online game “Forest of Savior (FOS),” which was a game that Akane also started playing in order to spend more time with Takuma. Unable to hold in her stress, she goes on to relieve her distress onto weak mobs in FOS. Then, YAMADA from the same guild happens to find her. She spills what she had just gone through with her now broken up boyfriend but has no idea that this is going to change her life drastically.\nSource: crunchyroll",
