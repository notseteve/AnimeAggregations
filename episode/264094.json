  "description" : "The class rep waits for Manami at the finish line in the mountains in order to show her support. When Manami was distraught over losing to Sohoku at last year`s Inter-High, she didn`t know what to say to him. She became concerned about the way he practiced to the point of injuring himself and asked Toudou for advice, but he responded that the deep wounds Manami suffered wouldn`t heal right away, and all she could do was watch over him. One year later, the class rep sensed Manami was finding an answer as the race approached.\nSource: crunchyroll",
