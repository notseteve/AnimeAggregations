  "description" : "Kircheis returns to Reinhard after subjugating a frontier starzone. He wastes no time in asking Reinhard if there`s truth in the rumor that he knew of the plans for the nuclear attack on Westerland, but let it happen anyway. With the final battle against the coalition of nobles looming before them, the pair`s relationship begins to take a turn like none they have experienced before. Meanwhile, the Lippstadt Nobles Coalition, which had barricaded itself in Geiersburg Fortress, prepares to launch all of its forces in the final battle against Reinhard.\nSource: crunchyroll",
