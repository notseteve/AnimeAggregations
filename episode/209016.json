  "description" : "On a certain riverbank live three youkai - Adzuki-washer, Adzuki-weigher, and the Adzuki Hag. In the modern age, where no one even touches adzuki beans, no one notices them. As the three of them try to think of ways to suppress the popularity of Western sweets and bring back adzuki, Ratman happens by. He sees it as a way to make lots of money, and suggests that they should become popular on streaming video sites so that they can promote adzuki. The videos of the three, produced by Ratman, become super popular and Ratman is overjoyed. However, the three youkai start arguing about the best way to show their love for adzuki, and their friendship begins to crumble!\nSource: crunchyroll",
