  "description" : "Masuzu proposes that Chiwa act out incidents from her previous life and has her and Eita act out a scene she creates. This impresses their classmates who believed they were performing a drama sketch. Masuzu then decides it`s time for Chiwa to ask Sakagami out. She agrees, and does so by putting a letter into his shoe locker. Much to everyone`s surprise he meets up with her and agrees to a date the following Sunday. Eita cooks all of Chiwa`s favourite foods to celebrate. However, she is disturbed that Eita seems to be so happy for her and leaves, wishing they weren`t childhood friends. Eita later recalls how he originally wanted to become a doctor so he would be able to help Chiwa after she was injured and could no longer do kendo.",
