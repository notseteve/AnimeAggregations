  "description" : "The brothers are at the private beach of Lord Diavolo, the only son of the Demon King (Levi isn`t much of an outdoor type so he is absent). The ever-so-poor Mammon secretly tries to carry out his plan, which is to take a shirtless photo of Lucifer and sell it to Lucifer`s fans at RAD. However, his opponent is a tough one! With no openings, there are no photo opportunities. Mammon has had it and comes up with a final plan. Will he succeed...?\nSource: Funimation",
