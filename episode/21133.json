  "description" : "There lives a pauper called Gutaro in the city. He is said to be very lazy, sitting at the same place and not bothering to move for ten years. In truth, however, it is not laziness that keeps him there. He cannot move even if he wants to. On his buttocks is written a text of a sutra, which makes him sit with his buttocks touching the ground in order to keep a monster underground. Out of pity, Dororo washes the pauper`s body, and at the same time washes away the sutra. Then a monster called Tsuchibozu jumps out of the ground. Hyakkimaru fights against the monster, but gets pulled into the ground instead.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
