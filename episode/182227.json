  "description" : "Second place school Todo-dai Sagami continues to impress... Not only are they strong, but their clever play produces advantageous situations for them throughout the game. Their barely legal plays and words mess with the Jinko players... The game begins going in Jinko`s favor once Ebumi joins the game, but the stronger Sagami team tries to take the game back by force!! Do the savage Sekizan and the rest of the Jinko team have any chance at winning?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
