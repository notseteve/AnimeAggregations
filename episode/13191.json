  "description" : "Before Seiya, Shun and Shiryu move onto the next house, the house of Virgo, Aioria warns them about Shaka, the saint of Virgo. He tells them that Shaka is the saint who is closest to god, and to beware ifhe opens his eyes, because ifhe does, everything around him will die. We then find Ikki (Phoenix), who has been resting on a nearby volcanic island to heal the wounds he suffered during his last battle. He is attacked by some of ArIes`s men who were sent to find him. Phoenix easily destroys them, but is surprised by the arrival ofShiba-Shiba ofPabo, the Peacock disciple of Shaka, and Agora—of Lotus, also a disciple of Shaka. They threaten Phoenix and claim they have been sent by Shaka, their god, to destroy him. Phoenix appears to have met his match and his powers seem useless against these new foes, but when Peacock attacks an innocent girl who gets in his way, Phoenix`s powers soar to new heights and he launches a powerful attack against this evil duo. What happens? Stay tuned . ..\nSource: crunchyroll",
