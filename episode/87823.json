  "description" : "Nikaidou plans to use the next X Egg to create the Embryo and selects Kukai as his next target. Meanwhile, Amu is selected as the speech contest representative. The other Guardians lend their aid, but Saaya grows jealous when she sees Kukai and Tadase help Amu. Nikaidou takes advantage of Saaya`s jealously and manipulates Saaya into giving Kukai false information about how Tadase was gossiping about Kukai. Soon after, the two guardians are in an argument and Daichi returns to his egg. However, the arguing is a ruse by Kukai and Tadase to bring Nikaidou out into the open. Amu transforms into Amulet Heart and uses the Heart Rod for the first time to stop Nikaidou, but is unsuccessful. Nikaidou escapes, but he tears up Amu`s speech manuscript in the process. However, Amu is able to give an extremely short improv speech on friendship and wins the contest.\nSource: crunchyroll",
