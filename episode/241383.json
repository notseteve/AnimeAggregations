  "description" : "As a reward for saving the kidnapped Princess Flora, Rio has been enrolled in the primary school branch of the Beltrum Royal Academy. However, the students at the academy are mostly the children of royalty and the nobility, and they do not welcome the orphaned Rio. With so many scornful gazes turned toward him, there is one person who worries for him—Celia, a girl of twelve who is nonetheless, at her young age, the lecturer in charge of the primary school. As Rio cannot read, Professor Celia begins privately tutoring him after school.\nSource: crunchyroll",
