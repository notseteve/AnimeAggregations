  "description" : "Akane had recovered from her cold thanks to Yamada’s care, and she is finally able to log into FOS again. There she meets the new guild member, TSUBAKI in her FOS avatar. The two go to challenge a boss battle straight away but are overcome by its incredibly “solid” defense. They reach the time limit and unfortunately the boss gets away. But after fighting alongside each other, Akane deepens her friendship with TSUBAKI. After logging out, Akane calls Yamada to ask him for advice on how to strategize against this boss, which ends up turning into a very long phone call. Once the call ends, Akane finds new determination within herself.\nSource: crunchyroll",
