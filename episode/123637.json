  "description" : "As they leave the ruins of the Sand Zone, Taiki`s team finds themselves under fire from the Bagra Army`s assassin, Baalmon. Then a shock wave from the battle between Kiriha, Nene, and Blastmon sends Taiki and Baalmon tumbling into the sacred underground temple of a goddess. When Taiki extends a hand to the goddess statue he finds there, it emits a light that envelops him, which stuns Baalmon. He reveals that the light is called \"the light of the Goddess,\" and those it shines upon have been chosen as \"Warriors of the Goddess.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
