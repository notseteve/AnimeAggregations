  "description" : "Stark splits his own soul and shapes it into packs of wolves and launches them against Love and Rose. Preparing to deliver the finishing blow, Stark is caught off guard by Shunsui, who suddenly appears out of Stark’s shadow. Despite his best efforts to dodge the attacks, Stark is gradually weakened. Just then the wolves, headed by Lilinette, swarm over Shunsui. He brushes them off, and the wolves disappear. Stark calls out for Lilinette but hears no reply.\nSource: crunchyroll",
