  "description" : "Today is Valentine`s Day. While girls and boys are excited, Tanaka, who`s not interested in Valentine`s at all, finds a box of chocolates inside his bag. Judging by the pretty box, it`s obvious the giver has feelings for him, but Tanaka feels despair just thinking about having to show gratitude or giving something in return. There`s no name on the attached message and only says \"I`m watching you all the time.\" Tanaka and Ohta try to figure out the culprit... i.e. the girl behind the chocolates.\nSource: crunchyroll",
