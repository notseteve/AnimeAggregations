  "description" : "In Meiji are, Japan, Suzu Oki was born into a poor farmer’s family.  She was sold to pay the family’s debt, but fell off a cliff and ended up in Kyokai in the other world.  Because she can’t speak the language, she travels with Shusei, the traveling performers.  One day she meets an Immortal named Riyo who can understand her language.  Rin begs her to take her.  Riyo takes her to the mountain and gives her an Immortal Status so she can understand the language, but practically slaves her for 100 years.  Shokei is a girl of the same age as Suzu, but lives a luxurious life as the daughter (Koshu) of Ho-o.  However, Ho-o’s policy is too strict and the people rebel to take over the dynasty.  Shokei’s parents are both killed, and she’s forced to give up her Immortal status to start living as an orphan.  Yoko is about the same age as them.  She deals with her own problem as a new queen, but now she faces her crowd of Kei Kingdom at the enthronement.\nSource: crunchyroll",
