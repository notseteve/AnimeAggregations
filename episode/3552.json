  "description" : "We all decided to go into the city to go shopping and to see Tokyo Tower. Sakura seemed a little distracted, and said it was because of a dream she kept having. When we got to the tower, we were all excited to see the top, but as soon as Sakura went inside, she collapsed! Xiaolang sensed a Clow Card, but we couldn`t find it for a while, until he realized that Sakura had stepped on it. Xiaolang used the Time card and woke up Sakura so she could seal away what turned out to be the Dream card!\nSource: crunchyroll",
