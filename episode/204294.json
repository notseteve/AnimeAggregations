  "description" : "U.C. 0097… One year has passed since the contents of Laplace`s Box were revealed to the world at the end of the conflict called the \"Laplace Incident.\" Despite the revelation of the Universal Century Charter that acknowledges the existence and rights of Newtypes, the framework of the world has not been greatly altered. Meanwhile, the Neo Zeon remnants known as the Sleeves have temporarily collapsed after the Laplace Incident, and their activities are at a standstill. And the two Unicorn Gundams, the mobile suits that played a leading role in the conflict, have been deemed dangerous and secretly sealed away because they displayed power beyond human understanding. However, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 03, which disappeared two years earlier and was erased from history, has shown itself in the Earth Sphere once more. This machine called \"Phenex\" is the focus of many people`s renewed activity. As well as the Earth Federation Forces and the Sleeves, Luio & Co, a huge corporation with strong connections to Anaheim Electronics, is involved in the struggle for the Phenex. As Luio & Co. deploys the new mobile suit Narrative Gundam, what is its true objective…?\nSource: crunchyroll",
