  "description" : "The young girl calls Leicester \"Papa\", which scandalises Carina, but it turns out that the girl, named Minette, is actually a highly sophisticated automaton created by Agnes`s mentor, Mize Altowirz, activated by the burst of Ale energy from the meteor, and bonded with him as he was the first person she saw.\nThe next morning, Carina`s father, the Archduke Fabious Verritti, along with Chelsea, comes by and informs them that the meteor shower has caused some trouble in the underground treasury. The Ale energies from the meteor shower may have been absorbed by some of the treasures and created a crystal monster, and he asks the clan to investigate. At the advice of the Archduke they bring Minette along with them. They find the strange energies emanating from a magical door that leads into the dragon world, and they encounter a shadow dragon with a crystal on its head. None of their attacks work, but a strange woman speaks to Minette and tells her to use her powers to ease the dragon`s troubled feelings. She does this, using her Anima Pearl, and the dragon disappears, leaving a jewel in its wake. The strange woman, named Garnet, is actually a dragon and the monster they just fought was her shadow. She gives the jewel to Minette, saying that she can summon her by using it.",
