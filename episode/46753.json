  "description" : "In the prologue, scenes are shown of Japan`s eventual defeat after Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto dies on April 18, 1943, but the clock winds back to April 1, 1939. Having retained his original memory and his old surname of Takano, Yamamoto meets with a select group of Navy officers and propose a coup d`etat against the militarist regime. After he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt (plotted by warlords in the IJA), he meets IJA Lt Gen Yasaburo Otaka and explains his rationale for the coup while planning a massive naval rearmament project. All the while, Germany plunges Europe into war and the Tripartite Pact is signed. Yamamoto launches the coup a few days after the Pearl Harbor strike force leaves Hitokappu Bay. With Tojo being held at gunpoint, Otaka becomes the new prime minister and declares war against the US hours before the attack begins at daybreak. The Japanese fleet regroups to find and eliminate the US Pacific Fleet out in Hawaiian waters and lands amphibious forces in Hawaii - all in the space of two days.",
