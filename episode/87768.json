  "description" : "It`s Open House! Tsuna is poor at studying, and for him it’s just a day of terrible experiences. He’s hit with a question he doesn`t know the answer to and opens his mouth to give a random answer, but his tutor, Reborn, won`t allow that to happen. Reborn is watching from behind the parents to see that Tsuna gets the answer right. But then Lambo and the others come barging in! In the end, the teacher has to leave to carry off Gokudera after he passes from seeing Bianchi. The classroom is unsettled. At that moment, a certain man stands at the front of the class!\nSource: crunchyroll",
