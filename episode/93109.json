  "description" : "Yuuki and her friend Yori walk through the nearby town, and encounter a lost boy. Yuuki offers to take him back to his parents, and the child takes her to an abandoned building. He kisses her in gratitude, which knocks Yuuki unconscious. She awakens to find Kaname watching her. Kaname reveals that there is a party for vampires in the building, and asks Yuuki not to leave the room. Meanwhile, Zero has been assigned to oversee the party by the Hunter`s Association. The child goes to Yuuki`s room to apologize, and Yuuki follows him. She views the party as Kaname enters, and Hanabusa`s father offers his daughter in marriage to Kaname. Yuuki returns to her room, and Kaname returns. He lies down beside her, and asks if she wants to be a vampire and live forever with him. She agrees, and Kaname leans down to bite her neck. But before he can, he pulls away and apologize and says that he will not hurt her.\nSource: IMDB.com",
