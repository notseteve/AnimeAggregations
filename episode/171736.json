  "description" : "Yato and Yukine have once again taken on one of their 5-yen jobs, this time to take care of an infant while its mother sleeps. Hiyori comes by to visit in her spirit form. They are attacked by an ayakashi, which seems to be regenerating, and they cause a lot of damage to the house before they realise that its true essence is in the mirror and manage to defeat it.\nMeanwhile, Bishamon, disturbed by dreams of the past, orders Kazuma to find Yato, who has been hiding from her. She destroys several ayakashi that are harassing a spirit, and afterwards turns her into a shinki, which takes the form of broken mirror as the spirit was troubled. The large number of shinki she has takes its toll on her.\nYukine meets another shinki named Suzuha while he is out on his own and befriends him. It turns out that he is another one of Bishamon`s shinki.",
