Meanwhile, Stroheim manages to awaken the pillar man, naming him Santana. To test him, Stroheim sends a vampire after Santana, which he absorbs into his body to feed itself. To Shorheim`s shock, Santana manages to escape his cell by twisting his body through the air vents and confronts him, quickly learning and killing Stroheim`s men.
