  "description" : "The “Empress of Night” turns out to be none other than Wise’s mother, who she split up with after a fight. When the two of them went their separate ways, the Empress decided to stop playing the game and instead go chasing after attractive men. And since she was using a powerful cheating tool that could change how the system worked, even Shirase and the GM’s couldn’t stop her. Normally, she’d face a huge fine for breaking the license agreement, but if Wise can make up with her, Shirase is willing to let it slide. When she sees her mom flying around on a throne made of shirtless men, Wise is incredibly embarrassed. She agrees to Shirase’s plan, and the rest of the party agrees to help, too.\nSource: crunchyroll",
