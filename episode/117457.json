  "description" : "Feng Lan requests Aoi and Kazura to have some pictures taken of her restaurant`s food so that her menu can compete with a rival Japanese restaurant`s realistic replicas. Aoi agrees to do it so he can get a free baozi while Kazura reluctantly complies since they are both professionals. However, after the photo shoot, a cat takes the bag containing the film of the menu as well as the film containing a summer vacation photo of a Japanese lieutenant. Aoi and Kazura are forced to investigate the Green Gang to recover the film, but learn afterwards that the cat took the bag due to the smell of the baozi.\nSource: Wikipedia",
