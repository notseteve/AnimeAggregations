  "description" : "One day, between their rehearsals and training activities, the five comedy teams at Takako-so are given a chance to appear on television. Only two teams are allowed, so the girls hold a lottery to decide who will go. The winners are Bullet Kunoichi, with members representing two parts of the western Kansai region, and Akudare Kingdom, with members from the eastern Kanto region. When the two teams arrive at the shooting location, they realize something strange is going on. A quirky producer suddenly appears on the unusual set and has the girls start competing in a bizarre quiz program.\nSource: crunchyroll",
