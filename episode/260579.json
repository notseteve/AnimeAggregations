  "description" : "\"Of course not. You`ll never get the better of your big brother.\"\n\"Rise & Set,\" the new show co-starring the Kiduku brothers, has started streaming. With each episode, Futaba receives more praise on social media. Issa starts to feel pressure on set to keep up with Futaba, whose acting skills seem to improve by the day. One evening, Issa receives a text from his old bandmate Takenaka, who invites Issa out for drinks to talk about the show. Later, four members of Tsukino Productions who are all younger brothers—Rui Minaduki, Nozomu Nanase, Naosuke, and Ayumu—join together to form The Ototo Rangers and try to teach Issa to see things from a kid brother`s perspective.\nSource: crunchyroll",
