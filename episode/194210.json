  "description" : "The Akudarma Trio arrive at Edo in 1776 in order to find the inventor, Hiraga Gennai. They manage to find his house, but there’s a huge line in front of it. They figure they’re there to ask for inventions but the things leaving his house included a painting and a ceramic dish. Then someone who had a grilled eel shop stops by to also ask for help. The trio ends up having to prepare the best eel dish in order to get the Dynamond when Tokio and Calen show up again. If you’re not eating dinner while watching this, you’re going to regret it.\nSource: crunchyroll",
