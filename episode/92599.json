  "description" : "While Alucard remains trapped on the Eagle, Millennium starts attacking London. Zorin Blitz is told to head toward Hellsing HQ with a small group of soldiers, while the rest of the vampires attack London. They kill thousands of civilians and attempt to capture Integra. She manages to escape the vampire SS soldiers only after Walter sacrifices himself to hold them off; however, Walter is captured himself by The Captain. When the vampire soldiers manage to corner her, she is saved and later captured by a large group of pistol-wielding Iscariot priests, led by Alexander Anderson, Heinkel Wolfe and Yumie Takagi. After the credits, Alucard uses his powers to steer the Eagle towards London.",
