  "description" : "our class got to perform \"Sleeping Beauty\" in the school arts festival! We were given random roles, and Sakura ended up being the prince and Xiaolang was the princess. Xiaolang didn`t seem too happy about it, at least until he found out Yukito was going to come watch. Then he decided to put in extra practice before school with Sakura so that he could impress Yukito. When they showed up early, their practice was interrupted by the Sand card! Xiaolang had another smart idea and they managed to capture it. Xiaolang thought it was strange that the card showed up to attack when they were alone.\nSource: crunchyroll",
