  "description" : "Mana uses her power to obliterate Cat-girl body and spirit. Footage of it is broadcast and the antagonism between youkai and humans intensifies. Both sides carry resentments, and as they each seek to destroy the other, Kitaro seeks out Mana to learn the truth of things. Meanwhile, Mana hears about her bloodline and her maternal great-grandmother. It was that great-grandmother who gave her her name, and she also had the same kind of connection to the unseen world. Kitaro appears. Mana`s rage over her mother`s hurt and Kitaro`s rage over Cat-girl`s obliteration clash. What will happen to these two who stand in the space between humans and youkai...?\nSource: crunchyroll",
