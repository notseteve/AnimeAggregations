  "description" : "Despite confessing his feelings for Oko, Sataro left Edo due to unavoidable circumstances with a promise to return, but now Seiji has received word that Sataro has indeed been true to his word and returned to the city. However, Sataro has yet to come and see Oko, which leads to some suspicion that he might be missing or met with some unfortunate accident. For Oko`s sake, and pushing his own feelings aside, Seiji looks for Sataro, but he is completely blindsided when confronted by Oko`s true feelings.\nSource: crunchyroll",
