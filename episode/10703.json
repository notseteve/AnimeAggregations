  "description" : "A mysterious man calling himself Fukamichi suddenly appears in front of Tsukio and Reiichi asking them to join the Fukamichi Ranking. Tsukio is annoyed at his attitude but invites Lucha Master to take his place. Right when they think the fight is about to start, Fukamichi calls out the 36th ranked fighter in the Fukamichi Ranking and he defeats Lucha Master in one second. The three of them are disappointed and shocked by this. While this is going on, a man who says he is in the Fukamichi Ranking appears before Kai and Mio. This man is named Yashiki. He appears to want to fight the Air Master. He is ranked number nine and appears quite confident in his fighting abilities. Kai doesn`t really understand what the Fukamichi Ranking is all about but she says to Yashiki that if he wants to fight the Air Master, he has to beat her first. Then Yashiki busts out an osmosis attack like Kaori Sakiyama`s, and a strong one at that! Kai is knocked down in one blow! Miori is stunned by what is happening before her and she called out for her sister, Maki! The mysterious street fighting story of the Fukamichi Ranking is underway!\nSource: crunchyroll",
