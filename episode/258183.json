  "description" : "At last, the finals have begun. Yusa immediately begins attacking at the start of the match. He is clearly rushing the game. He must still be tired from the doubles final. Ryo settles on a strategy of running Yusa around the court. He eventually makes an impressive shot, but Ryo`s careful observation of Yusa`s movements reveal to him that that was no ordinary mistake.
