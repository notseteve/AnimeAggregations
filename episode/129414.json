  "description" : "As the rare Puffer Whale makes its appearance once in every ten years, Toriko and Komatsu go to meet the chefs that prepare its meat. Upon arriving at their destination, they meet one of the Four Heavenly Kings, Coco, to request his help in capturing and preparing the Puffer Whale. Together they enter a cave labrynth in search of the Puffer Whale, though Coco predicts Komatsu might die. It is revealed that Coco`s body contains several types of poison which ward away beasts, but has also made him a target for those interested in the antibodies he produces. As they approach the beach, Komatsu goes missing and Toriko and Coco are approached by the fearsome Devil Snake.\nSource: Wikipedia",
