  "description" : "Yomi feels alienated by the closeness that Mato and Yu share. On top of that, Kagari now won’t have anything to do with her. As a result, Yomi has a complete breakdown. But it’s not only Yomi... Kagari and Arata are also behaving oddly somehow. At a loss, Mato pays Saya a visit, but the school counselor’s eerie speech and behavior only make her more uneasy, until Mato runs out of the office without thinking. Then something even worse happens... Around the same time in the other world, Black★Rock Shooter and Deadmaster are waging a gory battle.",
