  "description" : "Chacha joins HXEROS as a new member and starts living with the team in the same dormitory. Chacha enters Retto’s consciousness to find the source of his H-energy. While still merged with Retto’s consciousness, she visits the rooms of Maihime, Momoka, and Sora and stimulates their H-energy. She ends up taking a bath with Kirara, which makes Retto antsy. Chacha’s powers are too much for Kirara, who faints from the heat. Chacha realizes that Retto is in love with Kirara and takes control over his body while whispering to him that now is his chance.\nSource: Funimation",
