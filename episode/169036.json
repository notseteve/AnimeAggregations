  "description" : "Yuki has reverted to her original personality and does not consciously remember much of what her other persona said and did, particularly the fact that she confessed her love to Kyon. Kyon however remembers this all too clearly and is as a result very awkward to her. Haruhi and Koizumi visit the Literature Club again, and press Kyon into helping find a nice bamboo sapling to use for hanging written wishes as it is July 7, the Tanabata festival. Haruhi remembers that she met Kyon long ago, as he helped her produce her \"message to the aliens\", though he has forgotten about this himself.",
