  "description" : "One of the most popular idols in the netherworld, Kuromu-chan, holds an all-day concert at the Makubari Dome. Dem-dols have the important job of helping demons release the stress and evil desires they feel during their Evil Cycle. Kuromu was considered a shining new star in the field, and her tickets would usually sell out in one day. But she actually had a secret that she couldn’t tell anyone... Iruma just happened to be lucky enough to get tickets for her concert and takes Asmodeus and Clara with him!\nSource: crunchyroll",
