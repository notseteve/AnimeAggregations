  "description" : "There is only one girl in the village. When asked, she says all the villagers have gone to the mountains to look for gold and have never come back. Hearing that there is plenty of gold lying around in the mountains, Dororo also goes there with the girl guiding her. Hyakkimaru thinks the villagers` disappearance did not happen recently. Sensing the presence of a monster in the mountains, Hyakkimaru follows Dororo. Waiting there is a monster called Momonga. The girl is, in fact, Momonga in disguise. She lures travelers into the mountains by telling them about the gold, and feeds her huge slug on them.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
