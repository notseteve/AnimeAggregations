  "description" : "Kogoro is hired by four different clients to perform the same job: protect the racing horse White Spirits, which Conan finds strange. White Spirits is transported by trailer to the track in order to race, but when the trailer arrives, the horse that comes out of it is a different horse that looks a lot like White Spirits. Kogoro becomes discouraged when the media blast him and the police for allowing White Spirits to be kidnapped on their watch, leaving Conan to solve the case.\nSource: crunchyroll",
