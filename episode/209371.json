  "description" : "Seth has rapidly gained more magical power, but he`s gotten so used to it that his handling of magic is has grown sloppy. To teach him a lesson, Yaga forces Seth to wear gloves that prevent magic use and says that if he removes them, he`ll be expelled. Meanwhile, the Bravery Quartet that Seth met in Pompo Hills is now up to no good in Artemis Academy. Seth tries to stop them, but without the use of his magic, it`s a tough battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
