  "description" : "After school, Ringo, Leila, and Natsuki are talking with their classmates about Mr. Atsui`s assignment, an essay about their dreams.  The others are excited as they each talk about dreams such as wanting to be a pro soccer player or taking over the world.  However, Okada silently listens to everyone. When Leila asks Okada what his dream is, he says it`s nothing big and laughs it off, but it seems Okada has a dream he wants to come true as well. While walking home that day, Okada spots an old lamp on the ground. Okada stares at the strange lamp and decides to rub it a little. Suddenly, the lamp glows and from inside the lamp, the genie Alijiji comes flying out! Alijiji tells the shocked Okada that he will grant three of his master`s wishes.\nSource: crunchyroll",
