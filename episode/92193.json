  "description" : "\"Haruka appears at Yuuto’s door, in tears. \nShe tells him how her father, Gentou, has returned home and has thrown away all the otaku-goods that she had been treasuring. \nGentou has his mind set, and would not budge that manga and anime are an inferior form of entertainment. Haruka have been trying her best to hide her Akiba-kei hobby, but she’s had enough of her father’s unreasonable attitude, and runs away from home. Hazuki also accompanies Haruka as her attendant. However, it’s a matter of time before they will be discovered by “Hellhound,” unleashed by Gentou. Yuuto receives a call from Mika to survive for 23 hours.\nSource: crunchyroll",
