  "description" : "It is another typical day in the Yuuki household, with Momo sneaking into Rito`s bed, Lala having accidents as she gets out of the bath, and as Rito gets to school he has another accident with Yami, who is convinced to show him mercy by Lala. As the school day ends, Nana offers Haruna an energy drink from Deviluke, as Momo talks to her about how she should confess her feelings to Rito, and how it need not be a competition with the other girls as polygamy is actually a common practice in the galaxy at large. Momo identifies Haruna as being the key to the \"harem plan\". The energy drink Haruna was drinking makes humans drunk as if with alcohol, and Rito is pressed into bringing her home just as she starts to become seriously intoxicated. When they arrive at her house she strips down to her underwear and embraces him, continuing to talk about how girls who love a guy would want to make him her own, and very nearly confesses her love, except she sobers up at the last moment just as her sister arrives.",
