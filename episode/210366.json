  "description" : "Just as Midge and the others are trying to process whether or not they believe that the Earth has truly been destroyed, they are set upon by the frogs. Sebastian also suddenly starts to act strangely, and Lancelot steps up courageously to fend of the terrible frogs. Having safely gotten the password to enter the highway gate, Midge and the others return to the warp tunnel entrance. However, in a further stroke of bad luck they are attacked by a remaining working bug buster. The frogs also stubbornly follow after them and it looks like the bug group might not make it into the tunnel.\nSource: crunchyroll",
