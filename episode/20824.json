  "description" : "Laura decides to buy a gift for Travis` birthday the next day. Seeing Laura trying to decide what to get, Hamtaro ignorantly proclaims to the Ham-Hams \"It seems that tomorrow is the day to give a present to someone you care about\". Dexter and Howdy each decide to give Pashmina a gift and both go to Hamtaro for help. Hamtaro suggest a hand-made gift after seeing Laura knitting a towel for Travis. They eventually work together and knit Pashmina a cap and matching pair of gloves. The glory they get from Pashmina for the presents is quickly taken away when Penelope gives Pashmina some sunflower seeds. \nSource: Wikipedia",
