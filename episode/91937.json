  "description" : "Yuuto learns from his best friend, Nobunaga that the anime magazine, “Innocent Smile”, has arrived at the school library. Yuuto isn’t interested in anime, but he has some understanding of it from being friends with Nobunaga for so long. Requested by Nobunaga, Yuuto goes to the library to return the 6th issue of “Innocent Smile”. There, he sees “Silver Star of the Night (Nuit-Étoile)”, the school’s no. 1 perfect girl and his classmate, Nogizaka Haruka. She seems excessively suspicious in contrast to her usual self, and the book she was checking out turns out to be “Innocent Smile”!?\nSource: crunchyroll",
