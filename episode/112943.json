  "description" : "While fleeing the scene in her flying balloon swing, Reinya drops her shoe. Chutaro warns her the police might perform a DNA analysis on some hair attached to her shoe, but Reinya merely fusses over the pimple on her neck and her refusal to eat natto. Finally, Reinya decides to sneak into the Oedo Police Department and finds her shoe on a table. She approaches without caution, only to be caught in the Captain`s secret weapon designed specifically to thwart Reinya, the \"Phantom Thief Sticky Glue.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
