  "description" : "The giant yakuma has disappeared into the ground after swallowing up Yuzuki. The Toyotomi Army manages to find most of the Oda Army and manages to convince them to help find the giant yakuma and Yuzuki, though Nobunaga himself remains missing. At the same time, the Sanada, Uesugi, Takeda, and Date armies all struggle with large numbers of yakuma, having also followed after Nobunaga and Hideyoshi in the quest to go after the yakuma`s nest. When Hideyoshi spots a wounded Nobunaga at the bottom of a cliff, he asks for his help as well. Suddenly, the cries of the smaller yakuma echo all over the mountain and the giant yakuma reappears from the ground. Will the combined forces of the six supreme commanders be enough to vanquish this enemy once and for all?\nSource: crunchyroll",
