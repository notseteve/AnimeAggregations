  "description" : "During a school grip to the local art museum, Sakura noticed a young child causing a commotion over a painting called \"The Smile.\" Right at that moment, everything around her went dead silent! Suspecting that it was the work of a Clow Card, Sakura snuck into the museum later that night, along with Kero and myself. And when we were there, we ran into that child again, who turned out to be the son of the painting`s artist! The boy told us that someone had defaced his father`s painting, and so he snuck into the museum in order to restore the painting to its original glory. And as it turned out, the one responsible for both the altered painting and Sakura`s sudden loss of hearing was the card known as Silent. Sakura, of course, was brave and smart enough to eventually find a way to steal the card away again. She`s just so wonderful!\nSource: crunchyroll",
