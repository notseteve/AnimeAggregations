  "description" : "Their training complete, Riko brings Kinji and Aria to the villa, disguised as someone Kinji recognises as `Kana`, who has significance for him he refuses to explain. At the villa, they see the popular teacher Sayonaki, who is supposedly staying at the house doing his research with the owner`s permission.\nThey remain at the villa for two weeks, eventually discovering the precise location of Riko`s rosary which is under heavy security, and Sayonaki`s behaviour seems very suspicious. At the end of the two weeks Riko has them move, with Aria distracting Sayonaki as Kinji goes down into the underground storage room to take the rosary. Riko cuts Aria off from their radio link and speaks to him seductively in Aria`s voice, which activates his Hysteria Mode, and that allows him to steal the rosary just before Aria and Sayonaki return. After they deliver the rosary back to Riko, she double-crosses them, saying that she used them to retrieve it and now will defeat them both.",
