  "description" : "Even with a gun pointed at him, Hanasaki is brought to tears by the conversation between Twenty Faces and Akechi. Then the Boy Detectives` Club arrives on the scene. Inoue and Katsuda try to rescue the employees being held hostage by the security robots, while Noro and Ohtomo struggle to stop the robots. Kobayashi is stricken by an impulse he`s never felt before and runs toward Hanasaki, but Twenty Faces had already seen all this coming and brainwashed the employees to turn on Inoue and Katsuda. He then declares that if Akechi kills Hanasaki, he`ll make the employees stop and the whole thing will end.\nSource: crunchyroll",
