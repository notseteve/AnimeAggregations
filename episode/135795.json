  "description" : "Despite using Laxus`s lightning power to its fullest, Natsu`s attacks continue to have no effect on Hades. Rather, Hades awakens the true depths of his magic power before the powerless Fairy Tail wizards, immobilizing them with fear. However, Natsu bolsters his friends with the same words of courage Gildarts had given them during the exam, and leads them in one final assault against Hades. Meanwhile, Happy, Charle, and Panther Lily stumble across a mechanical heart on the ship and try to destroy it.",
