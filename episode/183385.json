  "description" : "Takahashi Tetsuo, a biology teacher at Shizaki High School, has been fascinated with \"demi-humans,\" beings with characteristics that differ just slightly from humans, since he was in college. He wishes he could have a chance to talk with one, but since the demi-human population is fairly low, he`s never even met one. But then the school gains a new math teacher, Satou Sakie... who happens to be a succubus.\nSource: crunchyroll",
