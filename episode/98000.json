  "description" : "The Odd Jobs trio finds themselves watching after an old-fashioned and empty barber store called Kamiyuidoko. As they look over at the newly opened beauty parlor across the street, they see Kondo, who has been denied service! When the depressed Kondo enters Kamiyuidoko, the Odd Jobs trio find themselves in an awkward position, particularly since they don’t know how to cut hair. Disguising themselves, the gang tries to make Kondo leave, but after seeing his haggard face Shinpachi and Kagura take pity and invite him in. It’s time for an insecure man whose popularity is overshadowed among good-looking men to get a makeover!\nSource: crunchyroll",
