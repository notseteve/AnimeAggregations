  "description" : "Since Yoko grew up in Horai, she can not believe in the Heaven’s Will, yet, she is afraid of repeating the mistake Shoko made for the same suspicion.  En-o tells Yoko a story about a man he calls another him.  En-o and Atsuyu both had a cowardly father.  Atsuyu got rid of his father for the people and En-o let the people die for his father.  Atsuyu demands a new emperor status above the king for the people, and En-o faces him to see who deserves the king.  En-o survives and Atsuyu lies in his grave.  En-o’s story does not give Yoko answers but a plenty of inspiration.\nSource: crunchyroll",
