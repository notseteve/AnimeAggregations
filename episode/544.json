  "description" : "The girls are talking about \"friendship and beyond\", browsing Aki`s middle school photo album. On one photo Aki looked particularly angry but she won`t tell her friends what happened back then, and insists on going to the karaoke box instead.\nOn their way through the rain they meet a boy taking photographs of flowers; Aki is surprised to meet him there. \"Ueno - my ex-boyfriend\", she explains to her friends later. Which brings back memories of the time when they had to make the middle school graduation album together and he fell in love with the rain, right when she was falling in love with him.",
