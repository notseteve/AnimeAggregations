  "description" : "I`m Yoshikawa Chinatsu, and I love, love, love Yui-senpai. I can`t believe I just said that out loud. How embarrassing!\nFinal exams have ended and summer vacations has begun... but with school out of session, I don`t get to see Yui-senpai. Summer`s boring! Is what I was thinking when I got an invitation from my Yui-senpai! I`m so happy. I want to swim in the ocean during the day and set off fireworks at night! Yui-senpai`s swimsuit! Yui-senpai`s yukata! Hooray, summer`s great!\nSource: crunchyroll",
