  "description" : "It turns out that the former Chosai, Seikyo, controlled Gaho and Shoko.  Seikyo sends the Royal Army to fight the rebels in Takuho not knowing that Kei-o, Yoko is among them.  Suzu, Shokei and Yoko can relate to the Takuho guys not joining the rebellion because it used to be more comfortable for them to play a victim than to make a courageous move for fair treatment.  Kosho and Sekki debate over whether to help the villagers under attack by the enemy, which will put them in bigger trouble.  Yoko, Suzu and Shokei debate over whether to save a boy being killed, knowing that others are being killed elsewhere.  They all conclude to do the best they can to live by their principle.  Yoko believes results should be better achieved by discouraging the enemy without killing them, and that’s why she decided to take Shoko to court instead of killing him.  Yoko reveals her identity as Kei-o to Suzu and Shokei, and Suzu and Shokei reveal theirs to the villagers who blamed the rebels for starting trouble for them.\nSource: crunchyroll",
