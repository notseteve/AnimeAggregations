  "description" : "Tanaka`s class, 1-F, is going to do a haunted house for the Cultural Festival. While everyone is having fun assigning tasks, Tanaka hides his presence to avoid doing any of them. However, the only thing remaining for him to do was play the role of the ghost, the main attraction of the haunted house. Tanaka had zero motivation at first, but soon realizes people working on other tasks are much busier. With everyone`s hard work, the haunted house turns out to look like the real thing.\nSource: crunchyroll",
