  "description" : "As Elder-Ham`s Sunflower Seed Harvest Festival approaches, Sandy confesses to Hamtaro that she has a crush on Maxwell because he reminds her so much of her twin brother. Sandy asks Hamtaro to find out if Maxwell feels the same about her; Hamtaro is unable to do so. Elder-Ham, however, remarks how much Sandy looks like a boy hamster that he knew. The Ham-Hams vow to find Sandy`s brother, leading directly into the next episode. \nSource: Wikipedia",
