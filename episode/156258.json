  "description" : "Ryuko tries to take advantage of her flight and goes straight for Satsuki, but Nonon fiercely stands in her way until Ryuko destroys her airship with her own missile. However, Nonon puts on an encore performance unleashing her uniform`s second form, Da Capo, using its music to disrupt Ryuko`s communication with Senketsu. Ryuko counters this by manipulating Nonon`s sound waves to match her own, before sending it back against Nonon and defeating her. Meanwhile, Tsumugu delivers a peculiar bullet to Aikuro, who is prepared to use it on Ryuko should the need arise. Just as Ryuko and Uzu are about to begin their match, a mysterious girl appears between them who Satsuki recognizes as Nui Harime, Grand Couturier of the Revocs Corporation owned by her mother, Ragyo Kiryuin. Nui instantly pulls apart Uzu`s uniform by breaking its Banshi, the Life Fiber that gives it its form. Receiving permission to fight Ryuko from a disconcerted Satsuki, Nui pulls out a purple scissor blade and tells Ryuko she was the one who killed Isshin, sending Ryuko into a fury.",
