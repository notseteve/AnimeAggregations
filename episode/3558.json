  "description" : "We finally got to go strawberry picking! It turned out that Toya and Yukito were both working there that day. What luck for Sakura! Sakura wanted to make some delicious food for Yukito using the strawberries she had picked, but we got locked in the preparation room by the Lock card! We looked everywhere for a key, and finally Sakura got a clue from Ms. Mizuki sitting in a tree. I wonder why she was there. Anyway, after Sakura managed to seal up the Lock card, she made some strawberry tarts. Yukito loved them so much that he ate them all! Sakura was so pleased, but I don`t think Kero was.\nSource: crunchyroll",
