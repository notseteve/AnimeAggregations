The witch put a curse on Lum - that she would never be happy with her True Love.\nIn the present, a new Amusement Park has been built in Tomobiki, and opening day finds the whole gang sampling its pleasures. At a magic show, however, Ataru gets turned into a large pink hippo-potamus... FOR REAL!\nWhen Lum attempts to track down the magician that transformed her Darling, things start to get very weird, very fast!\nSource: crunchyroll",
