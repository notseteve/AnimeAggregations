  "description" : "Armin transcribes as Eren details Eren Kruger`s conversation with Grisha about his desire to restore Eldia. Kruger reveals that those who possess the Titan Power live for only thirteen years, along with the nature of the Coordinate. He tasks Grisha with infiltrating Paradis behind the Walls to take the Founding Titan from the royal family, and tells him to start a new family there before injecting him with the Titan serum. Puzzlingly, he mentions Armin and Mikasa; when Grisha asks who they are, Kruger doesn`t know. In the present, everyone attends the government conference, where Hange reveals the new information learned from Grisha`s journals: they are all Eldians, Subjects of Ymir, part of a special race that can turn into Titans, and are thus being persecuted by the outside world. Eren realizes that he can command Pure Titans despite not being of royalty because he touched the Pure Titan form of Dina, who was of royal blood. He keeps it to himself out of fear of what the military might do to Historia if he reveals this.",
