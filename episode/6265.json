  "description" : "Feeling guilty about what happened to his friends, Takuya took Dark Trailmon back to the real world. However, on the way home he turned into this freaky half-human, half-Digimon. Then, to make matters worse, Takuya returned to the same day he left for the Digital World. Thinking everything would go back to normal if he never left, Takuya tried to stop himself from getting on the train but Duskmon kept getting in the way. Takuya finally realized he couldn`t run from his fears, so he decided to go back to the Digital World to face the music.\nSource: crunchyroll",
