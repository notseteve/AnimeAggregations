  "description" : "Shun still struggles against Mime`s abilities and illusions. He then removes his Cloth and chains. While talking to Mime, Shun realizes he`s not fighting for Hilda and also dislikes fighting. Shun awakens the Seventh Sense and uses the Nebula Stream to immobilize Mime. Finally, he unleashes the Nebula Storm in order to defeat him. Unfortunately, Mime survives thanks to his harp. He then envelopes Shun with the strings on his harp, preparing for his final attack, Stringer Requiem. As Mime plays his music preparing to kill Shun, the chains still cannot sense any hatred. Before Mime`s attack kills Shun, Ikki arrives in time to save him. Briefly hearing from Shun that they must defeat the God Warriors and retrieve their Odin Sapphires, Ikki prepares to fight Mime in Shun`s stead.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
