  "description" : "It`s Seido`s practive game against Seiho, the beast from Aichi. Sawamura has a great first inning, striking out two batters. They`re facing Seiho`s ace Akashi, once hailed as the super rookie when he played at Koshien Stadium as a first-year. After an injury caused his form to deteriorate, he spent a year in obscurity. Now, he has returned armed with a muscular body and powerful pitches. The Sawamura-Okumura battery must cooperate to take on Seiho`s machine-gun-like batting lineup.\nSource: crunchyroll",
