  "description" : "Maika brings a big stray dog she found to Café Stile. She can’t keep the dog at home, so looks for someone to adopt it, but doesn’t find any takers. Eventually Dino is pressed into taking care of the dog, whose menacing eyes resemble Maika’s, at his place, at least until a willing owner can be found. Maika decides to bake sweets for Dino to show her appreciation.\nSource: crunchyroll",
