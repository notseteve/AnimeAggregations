  "description" : "Takemoto and Mayama soon discover Hagu`s artistic talents. They, as well as Hagu, discover Morita`s website which contains a collection of pictures featuring Hagu. Hagu gets upset and throws random objects at Morita, which included her wish list. Meanwhile, Takemoto plans to throw a teppanyaki party. Later, after his job, Morita spots one of the items from Hagu`s list, a pair of patent pink mules, in a store and buys it as a present for Hagu. Morita arrives back in a drowsy state and gives two bags of meat for Takemoto`s party, as well as the mules for Hagu. Hagu is delighted and Morita faints from exhaustion from his job. Takemoto offers to carry him home and suddenly notices his feelings towards Hagu on the way back.\nSource: Wikipedia",
