  "description" : "Tanosuke succeeds in getting the sword back after he sets fire to the blacksmith`s hut where Dororo is barricading herself. Immediately after that, she starts to slay the villagers. The sword has become even more bloodthirsty. Hyakkimaru saves Dororo and confronts Tanosuke, engaging in battle with the evil sword. During the fight, Tanosuke realizes he is controlled and manipulated by the sword, and thrusts it through his body. Tanosuke does not want to be taken over by a monster, and this, his act as a human being, breaks the sword into pieces. When Hyakkimaru defeats the evil sword, his real eyes are returned. What he sees with those eyes, however, is a ruthless human world that tries to exclude him by discrimination.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
