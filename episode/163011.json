  "description" : "Erika is so obsessed with appearances that she lies to her friends and pretends she has a boyfriend.  She even goes so far as to take a picture of a stranger to claim that`s him!  Unfortunately, he`s a student in her school . . . and he has a nasty sense of humor.  If she doesn`t want him to spill the beans, the \"girl who cried wolf\" now has to pretend to be his dog.\nSource: crunchyroll",
