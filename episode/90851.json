  "description" : "The Akagi District deity, Mubyōu, is looking for the Reverse Circle. She asks for the help of Tōru and Kuugen. Kuugen agrees to help only because Tōru asked her to. Mubyōu said the clam did not know anything except that the clam`s partner, a raccoon, knows where it is. After getting Tōru into the Akagi High School, Mubyōu reveals she was told it was in Tōru`s head. However, before Mubyōu can open Tōru`s head, what seems to be Ogami saves Tōru and takes him to the rooftop. Ogami acts strangely, and Daigoro reveals it is not his father. Kuugen attacks \"Ogami\" and it changes back into its true form, a raccoon. Noboru finds Ogami unconscious in the school. Tōru realizes the thing around Daigoro is actually the Reverse Circle, but Kuugen cuts him off before he is able to tell Mubyōu. A fight ensues between Mubyōu and Kuugen. Kuugen wins the fight and it appears as though she is about to kill Mubyōu, but Tōru stops her and gives Mubyōu the Reverse Circle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
