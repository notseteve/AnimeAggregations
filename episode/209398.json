  "description" : "Inuzuka asks Persia on another date, this time to the Harvest Festival at a lake near campus. Not long after, the twin sisters `Kochou Wang` and `Teria Wang` appear before him. They may look immature, but the two 14 year old Black Doggy House prefects are prodigies that skipped to the second year of high school. Can Inuzuka have a normal date with Persia while these two watch his every move?!\nSource: Amazon",
