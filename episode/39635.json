  "description" : "Phantom speaks, and she tells them that the girl is the exiled Queen Mariposa, of the planet Guardiana. She entrusts her to the Star Force for safe delivery to Guardiana. Phantom knows that she can no longer protect Mariposa because the Galmans and the Bolars both will try to destroy the planet. As predicted, the Galman`s interpret Phantom`s camouflage as a deception, and order that the planet be killed.\n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
