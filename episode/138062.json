  "description" : "At the prefectural tournament, the Achiga team defeats Bansei in the first round and eventually qualify to the nationals. To train for the nationals, Harue schedules the club to play against prefectural runner-ups. Immediately, Ako utters \"Nagano\", Kiyosumi`s prefecture, as the first one to visit, and therefore, they play Ryuumonbuchi High. There, Amae Koromo overwhelmingly defeats Shizuno but doesn`t discourage her or the team. Then, the excited team proceed to defeat other schools at other prefectures. After a ten day training camp, the girls set off for the nationals. Whilst stopping at a rest stop, Shizuno and the others meet Onjouji Toki and Shimizudani Ryuuka from Senriyama Girl`s High, who are also seeded in the nationals. As the club finally reach the nationals, they briefly pass by Miyanaga Saki.\nSource: Wikipedia",
