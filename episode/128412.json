At first Shuusuke seems hesitant as he doesn`t really have the money to go to a festival... but he simply can`t say no after Nao hints that she isn`t wearing anything underneath her yukata... so he once again begs his mother for a loan and accepts Nao`s request.\nAs Shuusuke and Nao are leaving for the festival they bump into Iroha at the entrance to the house.

The other AGE members are also at the festival, but they seem to have another goal in mind for the evening...",
