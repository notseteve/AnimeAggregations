  "description" : "March 3 - The Hina Festival is taking place at Hakuo Academy. Being under the dollmaker`s spell, Hayate is disguised as a lovely maid. The curse must be lifted before the end of the Hina Festival and to do so, he must go to the highest point in the area which is the clock tower and the master of the tower happens to be Hakuo Academy`s student council president, Hinagiku. She`s the only one who can reverse the spell. However, the unlucky female butler receives a confession of love from a guy and is under house arrest. That`s where we left off last time. It`s Hermoine`s, no wait, Hayate`s fate? What?! What else happened on 3/3?\nSource: crunchyroll",
