  "description" : "The point of the sleepover at Hana’s apartment is supposed to be a study session to prepare for the girls’ upcoming semester finals, but Tamate is more interested in cooking a delicious dinner for them. The girls also enjoy playing a video game and taking a bath, rewards for studying hard. They cap off the enjoyable evening with bedtime ghost stories which results in a freaked-out Hana being unable to sleep.\nSource: crunchyroll",
