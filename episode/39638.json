  "description" : "The Star Force returns to Earth to fix the sun. Before they can, they are attacked one last time by a Bolar fleet and space fortress. Desslok and his fleet of huge Desslok-gun ships arrive to destroy the Bolar fleet. But the fortress is impregnable, and destroys most of Desslok`s fleet with its artificial black hole guns. Flash Contrail crashes his AstroFighter into the gun, disabling it. Desslok`s ship, equipped with an extra-powerful Desslok Cannon, is then able to destroy the fortress. The Star Force goes on to shoot the sun with the HydroCosmoGen gun, restoring its fusion reaction rate to safe levels. Wilstar bids Desslok and the apparition of Queen Mariposa/Guardiana goodbye and returns to Earth. Mariposa fades into the sky with the body of Flash Contrail.\n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
