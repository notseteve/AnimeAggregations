  "description" : "Tosshi finishes the preliminary race in first place by rounding up all the contestants to block Shinpachi’s team from making the goal. Despite Toshi’s scheming, team Otsu-chan fan club makes a surprising comeback to finish in second place! Hijikata points out that the team cheated by changing their member lineup, but with his own member suspected of using a taxi, the objection is dropped. Kondo and Kagura also finish the race after taking the wrong route and being dropped off by the police. Meanwhile, what happened to Shinpachi who’s still in the race? That being said and done, the main event finally takes place!\nSource: crunchyroll",
