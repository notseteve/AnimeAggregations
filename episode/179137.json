  "description" : "Soran is kidnapped, and met by Chou Reigyoku. Reigyoku uses kinkou, the techniques that Soran was taught by his father when he was little. His kinkou is more powerful than Soran’s, so Soran has no way to fight back. At the same time, Houhou goes to save him, but Fuu Saen blocks her path. As the two of them fight, they can feel Reigyoku’s ki off in the distance. They agree to a temporary truce and go towards Soran and Reigyoku. Soran is about to give up in the face of Reigyoku’s overwhelming might. Houhou arrives and says, “Show him your power!” His grandfather, Shakurin, had taught him a power even stronger than kinkou. Soran’s kinkou begins to change color. What power does he have?\nSource: crunchyroll",
