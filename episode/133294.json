  "description" : "Students from Tagiru`s school are disappearing one after another! Meanwhile, Tagiru and Gumdramon have sensed something moving in the Digimon realm, DigiQuartz. Following its trail, they discover someone, or something, carrying a boy from Tagiru`s school... Tagiru rushes to follow him, but then he`s attacked by Sagomon, a Digimon that looks like a kappa! As even experienced Digimon Hunters call Sagomon a tough customer, Tagiru and Gumdramon are no match for his fierce attacks...\nSoon after, Tagiru confronts Sagomon again. He Digivolves Gumdramon in an attempt to capture Sagomon, but they are only pushed back further. When Taiki, who has been watching their struggle, declares \"I can`t turn my back on them!\", Shoutmon hears him and responds. After reloading from Taiki`s Xros Loader, Shoutmon Digivolves and gains further power through a DigiXros fusion. He then launches his attack on Sagomon! How will their battle end?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
