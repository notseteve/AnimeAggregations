  "description" : "Meet Ichigo Kurosaki, age 15. He`s a high-school student who possesses the uncanny ability to see ghosts. But when he meets Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper from the Soul Society who helps lost souls find peace, his not-so-normal life becomes even more abnormal. In order to save his family from the grips of a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans, Rukia lends some of her powers to Ichigo.  Much to her surprise, he absorbs most of her powers and in turn, he too becomes a Soul Reaper.\nSource: crunchyroll",
