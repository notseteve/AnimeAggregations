  "description" : "Kagura can’t sleep after wasting an entire day doing nothing. She tries to sleep by switching mattresses with Gintoki and changing where her eyeballs are focused and the way she breathes. But it all only helps in keeping her and Gintoki wide-awake. Taking Gintoki’s advice that exercise and a full stomach will lead to sleep, Kagura goes on a 50-lap midnight jog around the neighborhood and finishes an entire cooker of rice. But neither helps in making her sleepy. Will Kagura ever get a good night’s sleep?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
