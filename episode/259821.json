  "description" : "In addition to being the leader of ROCK DOWN, Shou is also a world-renowned violinist. While doing promotional activities with the others for VAZZROCK Live, Shou spends his free time practicing for his own upcoming solo violin concert. One day, Shou heads to a rehearsal studio and Haruto follows along, asking if he can listen. When the two reach the studio, Shou is unexpectedly reunited with Kodai Ejima, a violinist who performed with Shou in an American orchestra in the past. Ejima adores Shou`s playing and wishes Shou would devote himself to classical music again. However, when Shou invites Ejima to his solo concert, Ejima declines.\nSource: crunchyroll",
