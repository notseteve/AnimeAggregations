  "description" : "Elfman crushes Sol of the Land, one of the Element 4! Afterwards, the Phantom Mk II seems to slow down for some reason. That`s because the giant moves using the power of the Element 4. If all of the Element 4 are defeated, they can stop Abyss Break! There are only two left! Natsu faces off against Aria of the Heavens and Gray faces off against Juvia of the Deep! There`s almost no time left until Abyss Break is finished casting! What will be the outcome of Fairy Tail`s life-or-death struggle?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
