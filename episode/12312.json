  "description" : "A Mamodo impersonates Kiyo after nailing him to the ceiling and attempts to get information out of Zatch for his book. After fooling Zatch and Suzy into believing he is Kiyo, Kiyo crashes down from the ceiling and the Mamodo reveals his true form. He reveals his name is Kanchome and his partner Parco Folgore came from Italy to defeat Zatch. Two hours later Folgore returns to combat Kiyo and Zatch. Using Poruk, Kanchome transforms into a cannon but it is revealed that his appearance changes but he is still incredibly weak. Kanchome unwilling to lose to Zatch manages to gain a new spell, \"Koporuk\" which causes him to shrink. Kiyo annoyed, sets up a trap with a frying pan and chocolate and using \"Jikerdor\" traps Kanchome to the pan. Kiyo decides to let Folgore and Kanchome leave with their book intact.",
