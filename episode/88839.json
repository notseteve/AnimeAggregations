  "description" : "While channel surfing, Kūgen gets curious about what happens in school. She then gets Tōru to take her and Kō to Noboru`s high school. Meanwhile Noboru is unable to stop worrying about leaving only Kūgen and Kō at home. His preoccupation causes him to lose a badminton game and prevents him from noticing that his classmate, Sakura, has already asked him out on a date. Kūgen then arrives in school and starts participating in the different club`s activities. While chasing after Kūgen, Noboru and Sakura are attacked by three Earth Spectres. Kūgen arrives at the scene and rescues Noboru using wood techniques such as \"Humongous Tree Branches\" and \"A Tornado of Sakura Petals\". After the fight, Kūgen seals Sakura`s memory of the incident.\nSource: crunchyroll",
