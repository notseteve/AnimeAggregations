The two feed and leave the Tamers with a place to stay while the wind in the village dies down. Kazu and Kenta, desperate for Digimon partners, ask Babamon and Jijimon to be their partners. Rika and Renamon make a kite to take advantage of the winds. Along with Kazu and Kenta, the seperated Tamers fly off in hopes of being reunited with the others.\nSource: crunchyroll",
