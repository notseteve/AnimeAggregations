  "description" : "Motosu Urano, a college student and a bookworm of the highest order, loses her life in an avalanche of books and wakes up in another world as a sickly girl named Myne. Nevertheless confident that she can deal with any situation as long as she has books to read, she looks all over her new home for one, but doesn`t find any. To make matters worse, she couldn`t see any writing in town when out with her mother Eva. She realized that she found herself in a world with a low literacy rate, one where books were prohibitively expensive.\nSource: crunchyroll",
