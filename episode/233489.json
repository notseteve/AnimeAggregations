  "description" : "As Goh and Sonia unravel the mysteries of Galar’s hero legend, Leon suspects Chairman Rose is up to no good. Rose provided support for Leon as an up-and-coming Trainer, but when Leon and Ash confront him about the rampaging Pokémon, they learn that his mentorship of Leon was all part of his plan to restore the Legendary Pokémon Eternatus—otherwise known as the Darkest Day! Rose wants to use Eternatus’s limitless energy for Galar, no matter what gets destroyed in the process. As Leon prepares to catch and seal away Eternatus, Ash battles Rose; elsewhere, Goh is challenged by Rose’s secretary Oleana. Battling on different fronts, will our heroes prevail?\nSource: Official Website",
