  "description" : "Sakura started reading \"Alice in Wonderland,\" and she loved it. But she ended up getting literally pulled inside the story! She said she saw everyone she knew turned into characters from the story; Toya was the Mad Hatter, Yukito was the White Rabbit, Xiaolang became Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and Eriol became the Chesire Cat! I turned into a pretty member of the queen`s court. Sakura even said that Kero got turned into the evil queen and chased her all around before she managed to discover a link back to the real world! I was so glad she got back safely!\nSource: crunchyroll",
