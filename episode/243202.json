While the other competitor who are novices in using this magic fall behind, Airi is the only one who doesn’t give up. She combines her Jump Spell and speedy movements with Flying Magic and gives it her all in challenging Miyuki. Miyuki is struck by Airi’s courage, but also strengthens her resolve to win the match. Who will emerge victorious in the intense battle between Miyuki and Airi?\nSource: Funimation",
