  "description" : "Not all souls pass on properly into the Soul Society.  Sadly, they are abandoned and become Hollows.  In the midst of this transformation, they lose their hearts and seek out those they loved most while they were alive. Therefore, it is only natural that Orihime`s brother Sora, who has become a Hollow, seeks her soul.  Ichigo rushes to Orihime`s house and finds the Hollow has forced Orihime`s soul out of her body.  Will Ichigo be able to save Orihime from her own brother?\nSource: crunchyroll",
