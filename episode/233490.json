  "description" : "Chairman Rose is determined to use the destructive Legendary Pokémon Eternatus to produce unlimited energy, and Ash and Goh are battling hard to stop that from happening! Although Rose seems to have the upper hand, Ash’s Riolu suddenly evolves into Lucario and defeats Rose’s Pokémon! Elsewhere, Goh and Raboot battle Rose’s secretary Oleana. Things seem bleak for Goh…until Raboot evolves into Cinderace! Rejoining forces, our heroes realize the sword and shield from Galar’s hero legend are actually Zacian and Zamazenta—who appear just in time to help defeat Eternatus again! Goh catches Eternatus, and after adding it to his Pokédex, he leaves its Poké Ball with Professor Magnolia for safekeeping.\nSource: Official Website",
