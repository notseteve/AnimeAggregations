Just in time, Whamon jumps out of the water and takes the blast ment for WarGreymon. Whamon destroys MetalSeadramon using his own \"River of Power\". Whamon is destroyed.  It isn`t long after that Puppetmon comes up with an evil plan to destroy the kids. He makes dolls of each of the kids and uses these to make them do what he wants them to. He then separates Matt and T.K. from everyone else. Kiwimon attacks the other kids while Puppetmon corners T.K. T.K. realizes what the dolls are used for and tricks Puppetmon and destroys the dolls. The Digimon easily defeat Kiwimon and Puppetmon says that no matter what it takes he will get revenge on T.K. Matt thinks that T.K. no longer needs him around, so he goes off somewhere by himself.\nSource: crunchyroll",
