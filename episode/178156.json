  "description" : "The Garencieres launches an operation to rescue Mineva and Marida, and Alberto orders Marida to stop them. Herbage changes the Unicorn Gundam into Destroy Mode and confronts the Banshee. Meanwhile, Mineva has escaped Martha`s hands, and rejects Riddhe`s offer of help. Trusting that Banagher will catch her, she throws herself into the air. Just as Mineva hopes, Banagher saves her and takes her to the Garencieres, then heads back to the Garuda to rescue Marida and Zinnerman. Marida is controlled by her hatred of the Gundam, but Zinnerman`s appearance disrupts her determination. In his anger, Riddhe reminds Marida that the Banshee is also a Gundam. She is ejected from the Banshee, and rescued by Zinnerman.\nSource: crunchyroll",
