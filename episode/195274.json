  "description" : "The Akudarma trio travel to Tokyo in 1870 in order to find Saigo Takamori. However, they encounter a rather plump gentleman... who apparently is Saigo Takamori. The trio is surprised because he looks nothing like his statue in Ueno. Saigo-san has to go on a diet, or his life is in danger. He also apparently wants a dog, so the trio promise to find him one in exchange for the Dynamond. And then Tokio and Calen show up and they have a face off to see who can find the perfect dog for Saigo-san.\nSource: crunchyroll",
