  "description" : "After practice, Suzuka wants to share an umbrella with Yamato, but since Miki is there, she ends up lending one to him instead. The next day, Honoka introduces him to Shirakawa Nana, a pop idol who was her mentor. At karaoke, when Honoka goes to the bathroom to hide her embarrassment, Suzuka finds Yamato singing with a blond woman, and accuses Yamato of two timing Honoka. This is later cleared when Honoka and Miki arrive. Yamato doesn`t want to sing, until Suzuka challenges him. They start to sing a duet, but Honoka looks nervous so he stops, to show loyalty to Honoka. Nana probes him afterwards and realizes that Yamato is not really being himself around Honoka, that he is just acting like a good boyfriend without really getting close to her. Yamato vows to try harder to be a good boyfriend.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
