  "description" : "A notice has been sent to the magic high schools across the country that a portion of the events in the Nine Schools Competition will be changed. Shockingly, three of the six events will be changed. In order to respond to the sudden change in events, First High School`s Student Council is thrown in a frenzy to understand the new rules, reselecting athletes and readjusting their CADs. While everyone was complaining about the Competition`s management due to the sudden change in timing, one month before the start of the Nine Schools Competition, Tatsuya had a growing suspicion about the strong military flavor of all the newly added events.\nSource: crunchyroll",
