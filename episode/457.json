  "description" : "When Sugimoto is fed up with Yoko’s whiny attitude, a blond lady, Korin, shows up, tells her that the world needs her, and convinces her to act alone.  Feeling sorry for hungry Asano, Yoko decides to rob people of food, but the victims turn out to be the mother and son she met before.  The mother and son invite the two to lunch but Yoko cannot trust them this time and walks away.  Then, monsters attack and Asano falls off a cliff.  Yoko beats the monsters but faints out of hunger and fatigue.  When she wakes up, she sees Korin and Sugimoto.  Sugimoto attacks her by surprise.\nSource: crunchyroll",
