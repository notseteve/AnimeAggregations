  "description" : "Kiyo and Zatch are overpowered by Bari`s spells. Kiyo and Zatch resort to their strongest spell \"Bao Zakeruga\" but Bari is able to block it. Kiyo is unable to move or use spells after using \"Bao Zakeruga\" thus forcing Zatch to fight Bari hand to hand. Bari hesitates when he sees Zatch`s eyes causing Bari to be knocked down. Zatch moves Kiyo to a safe place and continues his battle. Kiyo attempts to help Zatch by running a Loader into the factory to collapse the ceiling onto them. Bari goes after Kiyo to burn Zatch`s book. As he looks into Zatch`s eyes again, he stops and asks why. Gustav asks Zatch what kind of king he wants to be to which he replies a kind king. Bari finds the idea ridiculous and challenges Zatch whether a kind king or a powerful king will be fit for the throne. He leaves sparing Zatch`s book.",
