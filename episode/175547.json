  "description" : "While in deep thought over his meeting with Izana, Zen gets into an accident and becomes injured. Mitsuhide goes to seek help from the Chief Herbalist, but instead encounters a strange plant and accidentally inhales it`s fragrance. The fragrance causes a deep part of Mitsuhide`s personality to emerge, causing his loyalty towards Zen to become stronger. While Shirayuki is tasked to find an antidote, Zen instead orders to have the medicine naturally leave his system. However, Zen begins having a difficult time when Mitsuhide refuses to leave his side and becomes extremely overprotective. Eventually, after speaking with Shirayuki and when Mitsuhide saves them from being injured, Zen wishes for him to go back to normal. Shirayuki soon discovers the cure, causing Mitsuhide to revert back to normal with no memory of his recent behaviour. Due to her hard work, Shirayuki is promoted to an official court herbalist, ending her apprenticeship. Shirayuki is pleased, but remembers that soon she must make a decision regarding the future of her relationship with Zen. \nSource: Wikipedia",
