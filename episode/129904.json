  "description" : "Jirocho and Gin battle Kada`s elite Harusame forces while the rest of the denizens of Kabuki-cho take on her main forces in the streets. Kada is utterly stunned when her elite forces are beat by just these two humans, and flees the scene. Gin then helps Jirocho resolve his issues regarding Tatsugoro; Otose and Jirocho reconcile at the hospital. Outside the hospital, Kada desperately launches one last feeble attempt at conquering Kabuki-cho, but is stopped in her tracks by Pirako and the Yorozuya - Kada settles for swearing that the Harusame will be back, and flees yet again. At the very end, Jirocho denounces all other names he has ever been called except for Father of Pirako, and goes with his daughter back to the country.",
