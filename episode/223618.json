  "description" : "Deep in the mountains to the south, a certain youkai, nicknamed Chin-san, makes up his mind. \"I want everyone in the village to be able to live an easy life!\" He goes to Japan, but gets apprehended for being completely naked. Kitaro arrives, and Mana, who came with him, hands Chin-san a towel allowing the event to end without incident. He wraps the towel around his waist and looks fervently for somewhere to work. As a result of his hard work, he is engaged at a certain workplace, and both he and Mana rejoice. But the foreigners employed at that new workplace never smile. When he learns why, Chin-san is enraged, and his hand goes to the towel around his waist!? How will this end?! And what is Chin-san`s real name...?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
