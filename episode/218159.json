  "description" : "Schaal decides to go on a journey with Hank, the man who killed her father. Their next destination was Roguehill, a town with a giant fortress. A monster lived in the fortress, which meant that the war still continued in this town. Hank was then greeted by Liza, a woman in charge of supporting Hank. According to Liza, the one who created the fortress was the Incarnate, Minotaur. Hank then heads to the fortress to fulfill his oath. On his way to the rather warped, overgrown, and “complete” fortress, Hank mutters, “I’m the one who turned him into a Beast.“\nSource: crunchyroll",
