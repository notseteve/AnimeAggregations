Akari returns to take part in an officer exchange program with the NYPD, where her father once served in the line of duty, but it doesn`t take long for her to run into a tricky sorceress named Liberty.\nWhen Liberty`s magic creates havoc on the street, a teddy bear with a familiar-sounding voice comes to Akari`s rescue. It`s Apple! But Apple`s mysterious reappearance only raises further questions. Who is Apple, really? What is Liberty doing here? And can Akari truly save Christmas?\nSource: crunchyroll",
