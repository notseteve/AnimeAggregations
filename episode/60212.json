  "description" : "As summer begins to wane, Alicia and Akari give a tour to an elderly couple who have come to Neo-Venezia to celebrate their anniversary.  Although the woman is sweet and charming, the man is a bit of a grump.  He orders her around, doesn`t seem interested in sightseeing with his wife, and just acts cranky in general.  But things aren`t always as they appear...  Even though he`s tough on the outside, he still wants what`s best for his wife, and it`s up to the girls to help him set up a celebration that she`ll remember always.\nSource: crunchyroll",
