The captain named Amon turns out to be an old acquaintance of Favaro and his father`s who takes them aboard. It is revealed Favaro`s father, Barossa, was a bandit chief but Favaro chose to strike it out on his own as a bounty hunter. Meanwhile Kaisar continues his pursuit of Favaro with Rita the zombie necromancer tagging along.
