  "description" : "Evading Marida, who has come to take Audrey back to the Garencieres, Banagher finally manages to get Audrey to the mansion in Magallanica where she hopes to meet with Cardeas, the current head of the Vist Foundation. Here he sees the \"Lady and the Unicorn\" tapestry, and feels a strange sense of déjà vu. Cardeas appears, sending Banagher away and then refusing Audrey`s plea that he halt the handover of Laplace`s Box, which could start another war. At the same time, the Earth Federation Forces assault landing ship Nahel Argama, which is carrying an ECOAS special forces team on a secret mission to stop the Box from changing hands, is approaching Industrial 7. Zinnerman and his comrades, who are members of a Neo Zeon remnant group known as the Sleeves who have survived Char`s Rebellion, begin negotiations to transfer the Box. But what Cardeas is offering them is merely its key. Zinnerman is also suspicious of Cardeas`s claim that he is keeping Audrey under his protection. Then they learn that Federation Forces mobile suits have engaged the Sleeves in battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
