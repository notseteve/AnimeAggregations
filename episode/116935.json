When she wakes up, she finds herself in a different world.\nStudents and teachers from Hanamaru Kindergarten have come to a gallery in Ginza to see Anzu`s father`s art show. A painting of Sakura and Anzu catches Tsuchida-sensei`s eye. Sakura explains Tsuchida-sensei`s role in the creation of the painting and begins to recount a high school memory while everyone`s eyes are fixed on the beautiful work.\nSource: crunchyroll",
