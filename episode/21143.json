  "description" : "A sword has the evil power of controlling its owner by taking over his mind. A man called Tanosuke, who is possessed by this evil power, suddenly challenges Hyakkimaru to a fight. The sword is craving for blood. Sword-thief Dororo is so fascinated by the sword that she finally steals it from Tanosuke. The evil sword, however, gains control of Dororo`s mind at the same time, turning her into a bloodthirsty killer who slays people one after another. After causing uproar in the city, Dororo barricades herself into a blacksmith`s hut. Tanosuke, now without the evil sword, is so desperate to get it back that he sets fire to the hut where Dororo is hiding.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
