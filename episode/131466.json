  "description" : "Shoma wakes up earlier than normal to find Ringo standing in his kitchen - she is getting Himari to teach her to make omelets. After she has finished making the omelets, she heads out on her `date` with Tabuki at the park. While Shoma knows this is simply more of her stalking antics, he tags along with her to try and solve the mystery of the Penguindrum.",
