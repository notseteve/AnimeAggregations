  "description" : "The three visiting wizards, who turn out to be the Earthland counterparts of Hughes (a woman named Mary Hughes), Sugar Boy, and Coco, battle Fairy Tail and demand to hand Lucy over to them. Michelle passes herself off as Lucy to protect her, prompting the rest of the guild to confuse the three into thinking that all of the females at Fairy Tail are Lucy so she and Michelle can escape. However, Hughes chases the two and forces them off the edge of a cliff.",
