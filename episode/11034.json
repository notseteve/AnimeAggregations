  "description" : "A quarter of a century after a chance encounter in space, fate looks to reunite two enemies on Earth: Goku, the planet`s staunchest defender, looking forward to the peaceful reprieve of a camping trip, and Cooler, brother to the defeated Frieza, on a quest to avenge his family`s honor. Backed by the frightful forces of his Armored Squadron, first Gohan and then Piccolo fall victim to Cooler`s wrath. Satisfied with no less than the death of the Saiyan responsible for Frieza`s demise, he seeks out Goku, prepared to destroy the entire planet to quench his thirst for vengeance. As Cooler taunts Goku with his friends` destruction, the Saiyan must again accomplish what he has only achieved once before.\nSource: crunchyroll",
