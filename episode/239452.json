  "description" : "Satoshi and Go return to Unova. When they get to Soryu City, Go meets Iris, and Satoshi finds out that she became the Unova champion. Satoshi battles her for his World Coronation Series. During the battle, Satoshi sends out his Dragonite against Iris Dragonite but is quickly tired. Satoshi sends in his Dracovish and defeats Iris`s Dragonite, but Iris`s Haxorus (revealed to have evolved from Axew) defeats Dracovish. Satoshi sends his Dragonite back out. Just as it seems like Dragonite will lose, Iris supports Satoshi`s Dragonite. Satoshi`s Dragonite then gains confidence and learns Draco Meteor and defeats Iris`s Haxorus. Satoshi`s win brings his rank to 99, promoting him to the Hyper Class.\nSource: wikipedia",
