  "description" : "At last, Yamato starts attending the local school. During breaks, he realizes that he is pretty much alone, since Suzuka has track friends, and Yasunobu has his local friends. When least expecting it, he is approached by Honoka, who is revealed to be part of Yamato`s past. He later accompanies Suzuka shopping, resulting in him getting sick. When he hears a knock on the door, with anticipation he expects Suzuka, only to find Yasunobu accompanied by, surprisingly, Honoka.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
