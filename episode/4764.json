  "description" : "After losing to Rio last time, Ayumu makes a comeback. Since each side has something the others want (Hiyono and the tape) another game is devised, this time by none other than Ayumu. After the game begins, Rio rushes off to catch up to Hiyono while Kousuke heads off to intercept the damning tape. When Rio pushes Hiyono onto a train it now seems like certain death for Ayumu. With a bomb around his neck and Hiyono on a moving train how will Ayumu get out of this alive!?\nSource: theTVDB.com",
