  "description" : "Hanasaki left Kobayashi behind and took off for Twenty Faces` hideout alone, planning to put an end to everything. But Kobayashi can`t accept that, so he follows him... even though the aura surrounding him has already disappeared. Unaware of this, Hanasaki reaches the hideout and finds Akechi, but Twenty Faces also appears and warns him that the hideout will soon be destroyed. Hanasaki throws Akechi into an escape shuttle and turns toward Twenty Faces, with his finger on the trigger.\nSource: crunchyroll",
