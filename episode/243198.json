  "description" : "The match between Eimi and Shiori begins, with Eimi using the same tactics as in the qualifying rounds to overturn Shiori’s ice pillars so that First High can dominate the rankings. However, Shiori comes prepared, and Eimi is driven into a corner. Meanwhile, Honoka takes on Toko in the Battle Board finals. As a Light Element, Honoka uses her Light Magic and her ability to perceive light with her eyes to dodge the Ancient Magic traps laid by Toko . Toko takes the lead in the race, but Honoka still has some tricks up her sleeve.\nSource: Funimation",
