  "description" : "The third battle between Storm Guardians Gokudera and Belphagor is a timed death match. The battle takes place on the third floor of the school. There are Hurricane Turbines that blow gusts of wind around. Since both guardians use projectiles, it looks as if the wind will be their greatest obstacle. But Belphagor uses the wind and showers Gokudera with endless attacks. As his nickname, Prince the Ripper, suggests, Belphagor can use knives anyway he likes. On the other hand, Gokudera cannot attack well with his dynamite. But he notices how Belphagor`s knives come at him from places that Belphagor cannot see him from. He retaliates with his new technique!\nSource: crunchyroll",
