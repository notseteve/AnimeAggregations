  "description" : "It`s bad enough when Mercurymon corners you in a world of mirrors and beats you up but then he uses Seraphimon`s data to turn into ShadowSeraphimon. It looked really bad for Takuya but energy from Seraphimon`s Digi-Egg let Takuya Fusion Evolve to Aldamon, who kicked the fractal code out of ShadowSeraphimon and Mercurymon. Takuya returned to the others and the Digi-Egg finally hatched but inside was only a Patamon. And what good is that little guy gonna be against all the forces of darkness?\nSource: crunchyroll",
