  "description" : "A new rival has arrived at Sainan Private High School, Ren, one of Lala`s childhood friends.  Apparently, Ren has held Lala in such high regard that he allowed himself to be her guinea pig for experiments, was proud of the memories where she made him cry, and is not the least be upset that she doesn`t immediately remember him.  What is upsetting is that she still does not think of him as manly.  When they were young, Lala said that she would marry him if he became manly, but he still has a ways to go.  Not to be easily discouraged, Ren first turns to Rito for advice, then to the female students at school.  To prove his masculine strength and charm, Ren embarks upon a rigorous training regime, including fighting a gang leader and Big Foot before finally taking on a 120 km marathon.  Ren is so close to becoming the model of what all me should be like when- ... erm, gesundheit???\nSource: crunchyroll",
