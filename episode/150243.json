My name is actually Yamashita Sumiko and I`m the teacher of the 1st Year, Class 3.\nIt`s raining today so I don`t feel like doing anything.\nI could really care less that Amaya is wearing rain boots and Iwasawa isn`t wearing any shoes at all.\nWhy is it even raining? It`s not like anyone wants to leave their house when it`s raining, so everything should just be closed.\nThen again, it would suck if the convinience stores were closed, too. Then...\n...Stop talking about this nonsense and go home already.\nAnd that ends the first semester!\nSource: crunchyroll",
