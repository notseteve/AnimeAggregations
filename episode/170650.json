  "description" : "Rindou brings Alisa and Lenka to a village where he sees the girl who was part of the family refused entry into the Fenrir base. The village is protected by a forest of Aragami trees which are capable of devouring most of the lesser Aragami who try to enter. It turns out that Rindou has been sending the refugees whom Fenrir would not accept to this place, and they have managed to live there, albeit precariously, with a hydroelectric dam providing them with power. The village is later attacked by several powerful Aragami that the trees could not stop, and Rindou has to prevent more from entering while he assigns Lenka to deal with the one that got through. Alisa is still deeply traumatised and cannot help, so Lenka has to make a plan that involves manoeuvring the Aragami such that it falls into the river and can be washed away by opening the dam. He realises that his God Arc is not completely broken and manages to use it to push the Aragami into the river as planned.",
