  "description" : "It is the school festival, and the Supernatural Research Club uses Sarushima`s powers to make a fortune-telling booth. Sarushima tells Yamada that she doesn`t like having her powers of prognostication as she wants to fall in love, and wonders if there is a way to remove a witch`s powers. They learn of Tamaki Shinichi, who has the ability to steal a witch`s powers. He already took the power of invisibility from the witch Asuka Mikoto. He bargains with Yamada, getting him to look into the future to see who will become next student council president, as he has sights on the position himself. The student council president says that he will appoint as his successor whoever is able to identify the seventh and final witch.\nYamada kisses Sarushima again and sees a vision of the future where Tamaki becomes president after taking Sarushima`s powers and he has Shiraishi as his secretary. This vision of Shiraishi as sad and lonely as she once had been disturbs Yamada so much that he begins the hunt for the mysterious Seventh Witch in earnest. Yamada confesses to Miyamura that he has fallen in love with and doesn`t want to see her that way ever again.",
