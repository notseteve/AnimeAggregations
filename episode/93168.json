  "description" : "Kiseki has called another guardian character meeting, but no one is paying attention to him. Diamond suddenly hatches, much to the delight of Ran, Miki, and Su. Ran tells everyone of her crazy history with Amu, as does Miki and Su. They begin to fight over who`s hatching was less a hassle, and everyone laughs. Then, they talk about all the Guardians, and then how Diamond hatched. They all begin to feel Amu`s radiance in them. Later that day, Amu appears at the Royal Garden and Ran is about to show the hatched Diamond to her, when they see that Diamond has gone back into her egg. Amu questions Ran, and then Su points over to Kiseki, who all of the Guardians make fun of, causing Kiseki to \"become a spirit\" and we see Diamond momentarily hatch and giggles.\nSource: crunchyroll",
