  "description" : "Dr. Asagumo has been hiding in his body the blueprint (in metal form) of the secret weapon Big X. His friend, Dr. Hanamaru, extracts the metal from Dr. Asagumo-now in critical condition-but it is then snatched by a Nazi. Not knowing how to use the metal, the Nazis experimentally inject it into a mouse to see what will happen. Seeing that they create a huge mouse that attacks the town, Akira volunteers to be injected with Big X.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
