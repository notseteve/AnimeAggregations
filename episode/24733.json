  "description" : "When a priceless jewelry exhibit comes to town, so does Phantom Thief, a famous burglar who leaves a note announcing his intentions to steal the Black Star-the most valuable pearl in the world. When the police corner Phantom Thief on the top of a building, it looks like his amazing career is over until he uses a flash bomb to blind his would be captors and make a harrowing escape. All that remains of the Phantom is a note announcing his next move: to steal the Black Star during an anniversary party on board the Queen Isabelle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
