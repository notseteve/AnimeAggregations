  "description" : "In the year UC 798, or IC 489, the Iserlohn garrison fleet led by Admiral Attenborough encounters a huge Galactic Empire formation during a patrol mission in the Iserlohn Corridor. The Alliance ships were transporting a large number of new recruits who were supposed to have their space training there. Outnumbered, the Alliance command has no choice but to send out young and still unexperienced conscripts against well-trained Imperial forces. Julian, who was assigned to the flagship of the squadron as a Spartanian pilot, must now face his first real battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
