  "description" : "It`s been a week since the resolution of the crossroad killing case, in which the name of the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu was deceptively used. Although the name of Kamiya Dojo has been cleared, there`s no sign of an increase in the number of Kaoru`s students. Then a passing boy, Yahiko Myojin, pickpockets Kenshin`s wallet. Kenshin gives him the wallet, saying that it was his fault for allowing it to get stolen. Yahiko is repulsed at being treated like a child, but he has a reason to collect the money.\nSource: crunchyroll",
