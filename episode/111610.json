  "description" : "Hajime and Arashi are hanging out having fun. As Jun observes this, she refers back to the time when she talked to Arashi at the grave site. Jun remembers that Arashi tells her:  \"I will be gone once summer ends.” Arashi gets asked out on a date by Yamashiro in the meantime. Trusting in their \"bond,” Hajime is not fazed by this. Jun believes that Hajime is too carefree about this situation. Thinking that Hajime does not know that time with Arashi is limited, she tells him that he will only be able to be with Arashi in the summer.\nSource: crunchyroll",
