  "description" : "After learning that a signal thought to come from Mew was detected on a distant island, Ash and Goh set off to investigate. There they find a forest filled with wild Pokémon, including a group of Pokémon who are inexplicably afraid. They follow the Pokémon—and to their surprise, Mewtwo appears! They share their respective goals with Mewtwo, and it agrees to a battle, but its sheer power is overwhelming. After being defeated, Ash and Goh realize that Mewtwo has been protecting Pokémon who were mistreated by humans. Mewtwo and the Pokémon take their leave, and Ash and Goh find themselves in total awe of all they’ve experienced!\nSource: Official Website",
