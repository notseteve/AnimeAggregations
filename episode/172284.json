  "description" : "Shinoa and Guren have a brief confrontation over how he seems to be using Yuuichirou, and how Guren seems to be manipulating him for his own mysterious ends. He does not deny it, but denies that he is doing so because his demon weapon is manipulating him into it. She sees Yuuichirou who has somewhat recovered from his ordeal and is researching ways to turn a vampire back into a human for Mikaela`s sake.\nHe is called by the Hiiragis, the commanders of the demon army, and is warned by Mitsuba who was interviewed ahead of them of how ruthless and paranoid they are. He is also met by Guren who admonishes him to remember where his loyalties lie. He is tested by Hiiragi Kureto for his loyalty, and is interrogated, with Shihou and Yoichi being tortured in an adjoining room to ensure his honesty. Kureto tells him about the significance of his family name, Hyakuya, which was the name of the orphanage where he lived, and how it was before the vampire war the name of a group of powerful magicians who conducted human experiments on the children in their orphanages, so it is highly probable that Yuuichiro and Mikaela were the subject of such human experiments.\nAfter the interrogation Yuuichiro confronts Guren about Kureto`s revelations, and he does not deny it. Yuuichiro is not resentful, as whatever the reasons Guren had, if he had not saved him, he would be dead anyway.",
