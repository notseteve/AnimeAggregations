  "description" : "The match between Miyuki and Shizuku is approaching. Shizuku doesn’t want to miss her opportunity to go up against a brilliant magician like Miyuki, so she works on a strategy with Tatsuya to bring home a victory. Seeing how serious Shizuku is about the competition, Miyuki resolves to give it her all in the battle. The stadium is packed and the Ice Pilllars Break final match begins. Shizuku uses Oscillation-Type Magic, which is her specialty, but it has no effect on Miyuki. Just when everyone thinks that Shizuku will lose, she pulls out a secret move which takes Miyuki by surprise.\nSource: Funimation",
