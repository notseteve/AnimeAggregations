She knows about the other world he`s been to, and she claims to know at least three other people who have been there. Glenda hopes to get in touch with these parallel world explorers, but she`s had no luck contacting them through social media. So she decides to produce a video of Yotsuya and his fellow party members that only people who have been to the other world would understand.\nSource: crunchyroll",
