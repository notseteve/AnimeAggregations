  "description" : "Orochimaru tells Boruto and Sakura about the White Snake Sage who lives in Ryuchi Cave. On their way there, the two are confronted by Team 10, which is determined to take the two back to the village so that they are not labeled as \"rogue\" ninja. But there`s no way Boruto or Sarada will oblige until they find out the truth from Mitsuki, so they are forced into confrontation using everything they`ve got!\nSource: crunchyroll",
