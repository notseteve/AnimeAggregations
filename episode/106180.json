  "description" : "Hearing from Kajika that she met Quinza, Rumaty does not inquire about anything and quietly accepts the fact. After a while, Harry appears before Rumaty, who is alone in the garden. Rumaty is initially cautious of Harry since he does not know him but is intrigued by his words. At this time, Harry tells Rumaty to become the king. Oddly, Rumaty feels as if he was told by his father.\nSource: crunchyroll",
