  "description" : "Hana`s mother always bought clothes for her, but now she`s going to choose her own outfit for the first time. The problem is she can`t imagine what kind of clothes would suit her. When Hana goes to her friends for advice, Eiko proposes they all go out shopping the following day. Tamate is also excited about helping Hana choose an outfit that would look good on her, while Kamuri is more interested in having post-shopping parfaits. When she gets home that day, Hana ponders over the kind of clothes that would be her style.\nSource: crunchyroll",
