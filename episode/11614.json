  "description" : "In a very different Tokyo from the one we know today, the totalitarian government rules with an iron fist. But a group called \"the Sect\" is staging demonstrations and challenging the government`s martial law. Constable Fuse of the Capital Police`s Special Unit is on a mission to stop a Sect demonstration when he encounters a girl in the sewers under Tokyo. When he fails to shoot as ordered, he is put on trial, questioned, and \"re-conditioned\" as a soldier.  The dead girl haunts him, both in his dreams and in the face of her sister, whom Fuse has befriended. But Fuse has made himself a target for some very powerful men. And as the world comes crashing down around him, Fuse is continually challenged to decide what is real and what is right.\nSource: crunchyroll",
