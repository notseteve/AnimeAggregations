  "description" : "Daichi and Hibiki are two high-school friends on the verge of graduation. The latest rumor to go around their school: Nicaea, a \"dead face delivery site\" that supposedly sends photos of one`s friends at the time of their death. When Daichi and Hibiki suddenly meet their own untimely end, they are mysteriously revived by Nicaea and thrust headlong into a long-brewing battle between human and demonkind. Now, armed with Demon Summoning apps and accompanied by fellow student Io Nitta, they must fend off a series of demonic attacks that are targeting the heart of Tokyo.\nSource: crunchyroll",
