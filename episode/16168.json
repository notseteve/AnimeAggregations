  "description" : "With only two sections of the Digital World remaining, the Royal Knights are on the hunt for the next fractal code. Since no one knows where the fractal code in Ophanimon`s castle is, the Digidestined have set up a post at the Autumn Leaf Fair. JP is operating a large machine to rearrange the order of the town, therefore breaking up the fractal code to make it harder for the Royal Knights to locate. The Royal Knights delete the Digimon, so Takuya and Koji unified-spirit-evolve to KaiserGreymon and MagnaGarurumon to face them together. Dynasmon pounds the ground and is furious to only find one piece of the fractal code and starts to hunt for more. KaiserGreymon goes in to attack Dynasmon while MagnaGarurumon continues his assault on Crusadermon.\nSource: crunchyroll",
