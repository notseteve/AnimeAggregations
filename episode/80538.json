  "description" : "Gintoki and the gang are suddenly attacked by maids and split up into two groups. Gintoki and Kagura act as decoys to draw away the enemy maids, while Shinpachi takes Tama to Gengai. Tama tells Shinpachi that he has a 5 percent chance of surviving and suggests that he should leave her and run away. But Shinpachi tells her that a samurai protects the person they have sworn to protect no matter what. His words stir a mysterious sensation within Tama that she was not programmed to feel.\nSource: crunchyroll",
