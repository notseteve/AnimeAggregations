  "description" : "Anzu, Koume, and Hiiragi are excitedly discussing Koume`s pet rabbit when second year Sunflower Class student Kenji shows up. He taunts Koume, claiming rabbits die from loneliness. When Koume is on the verge of tears, the knowledgeable Hiiragi saves the day, correcting Kenji`s “facts” one after another. Kenji presents Hiirage with a challenge to settle their know-it-all battle once and for all.\nStill getting used to working at the kindergarten, Tsuchida-sensei panics when he is surrounded by a group of students. The agitated Tsuchida-sensei gives Anzu permission to explore the kindergarten with her new friends Koume and Hiiragi. While exploring the kindergarten, the three find a slide on the second floor.\nSource: crunchyroll",
