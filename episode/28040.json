  "description" : "Hydrogen bomb testing plants in country U are destroyed one after the other. Upon investigating the issue, Koichi finds that it is the doing of peace activists against the hydrogen bomb testing. The hydrogen bomb, which devastates the people and the earth, is unquestionably an evil tool. But the violence used in order to extinguish such evil is also an act of evil. The Amazing 3 see darkness in the minds of people who reluctantly resort to destructive power to secure peace.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
