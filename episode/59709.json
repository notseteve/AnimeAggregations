  "description" : "\"Pochi`s acting strangely!\" The heat is the cause of it. Tama and the others head east to ask the sun for a favor, but before they know it, the sun is already rising. Pochi starts acting strangely again, troubling everyone, and then the sun begins to wane...\nWhile Tama and the others are playing in the park, a dirty-faced dog named Angel appears before them. Soon, the sun begins to set and everyone starts heading home, but Angel has no where to go, so Kuro decides to look after her. In the middle of the night, Angel cries. Curious, Kuro asks why.\nSource: crunchyroll",
