  "description" : "As Yang fights the statue of Nicholas, Jaune and the Sillies fight the statue of Jacques. The robot army that had been created from Weiss’s nightmare fight the deformed White Fang which had been created from Blake’s nightmare. While battles are held in various places, Nega-Weiss clashes with Nega-Blake. Weiss is overwhelmed but tries to confront Nega-Blake, raging with Faunus’ anger who were being continuously oppressed. On the other hand, Ruby reaches the core of the dream and attacks the briar that covers the “Nightmare” but it quickly goes back to its original form and she is unable to destroy it. As she gets flustered, she remembers the words Weiss had said in Ruby’s dreams.\nSource: crunchyroll",
