  "description" : "After learning of his connection with Tsumugu, Ryuko tries to press Aikuro for more information, but does not get much outside of his organization`s name, Nudist Beach. Meanwhile, another of the Elite Four, Uzu Sanageyama, gets permission from Satsuki to fight against Ryuko himself. The next day, Uzu challenges Ryuko, facing against her in his Three-Star Goku Uniform, Blade Regalia. He has the advantage due to his fast eyesight reading all of Ryuko`s moves, but Ryuko overcomes this by using a part of her uniform to block Uzu`s vision, allowing her to defeat him and destroy his uniform. Refusing to give up, Uzu undergoes a drastic operation to sew his eyes shut, and challenges Ryuko again, this time using his other senses to predict her moves and completely overwhelm her. However, before Uzu can deliver the final blow, his Goku Uniform overheats due to him being more powerful than it can handle, giving Ryuko the opportunity to escape.",
