  "description" : "Being left by Hyakkimaru, Dororo cries all alone in the world. Then a woman appears in front of her. She looks exactly like her late mother Ojiya. So when the woman gently comforts her, Dororo goes to her house. Dororo sees her dear mother`s image in her, becomes fond of her, and starts to depend on her. The woman, in fact, is working for a monster called Hakumenfudo, who lives in a waterfall among the mountains. As Hakumenfudo does not have its own face, it steals faces from among the ascetics who practice in the waterfall. Now it is after Dororo`s face.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
