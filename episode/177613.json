  "description" : "At the order of the council of elders that manages Lugunica in the king`s absence, Wilhelm and Felis visit Roswaal`s mansion as emissaries. Emilia is required in the imperial capital right away, so Subaru asks her to take him along. Emilia tells him this won`t be a pleasure trip, but a push from Rem and Roswaal ends in her agreement, so Emilia and Subaru head to the capital. Now all of the candidates to be Lugunica`s next king are gathered, and the royal selection is underway.\nSource: crunchyroll",
