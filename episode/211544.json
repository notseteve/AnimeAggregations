  "description" : "Saki, who may have incurred the enmity of Tatsuko, Tachibana, and Michiyo, dies after falling from her apartment. Conan determines her death was not a suicide but a murder. He deduces that Saki was blackmailing one of the three using something she witnessed, and they killed her in order to keep her quiet.
