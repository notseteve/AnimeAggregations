  "description" : "After losing Ono to an injury, the Furuya-Yui battery has trouble establishing a rhythm, repeated making errors and walking batters. Still unable to recover, they give up runs and with the team in trouble, Furuya has to leave the mound. Kaneda the relief pitcher pitches well, but he is unable to stop Yamamori Academy’s momentum, and Seido’s winning streak ends at nineteen games. In game 2 against Seiho High School, the beast of Aichi, Sawamura is the starting pitcher. After receiving encouragement from Coach Kataoka, Sawamura boldly takes the mound.\nSource: crunchyroll",
