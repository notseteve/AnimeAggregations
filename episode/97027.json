  "description" : "Layfon, Felli, and Harley talk secretly about the plan to defeat the moulting male contaminoid that Zuellni is approaching, but are observed by Sharnid. Meanwhile, everyone notices how Nina seems to be going off somewhere late at night by herself, so Layfon, Machen, Miffy, and Naruki follow her. She goes to the site of the last contaminoid breach to practice, and as the four of them watch her, she collapses from exhaustion. They bring her to the hospital, where the doctor says that she is suffering from overworked kei, and should be forced to rest. Naruki explains to Layfon that she understands what Nina is going through: Layfon is much too strong, and Nina feels that she must get stronger in order to be able to fight beside him properly, and so pushed herself too hard.\nWhile Layfon and Felli execute their plan to subdue the contaminoid, Sharnid confronts Harley while they are visiting Nina, and gets him to explain what they were up to. Nina, now recovered, along with Sharnid, join Layfon in fighting the contaminoid, and working together with Felli they manage to trap the contaminoid in a canyon underneath a rock-slide.",
