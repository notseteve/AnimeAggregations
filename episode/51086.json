  "description" : "One night Otose, the landlord of Gintoki’s Odd Jobs, comes across a starving cat-eared Amanto named Catherine in the back alley and hires her to work at the Otose Snack House. Otose comes to take a liking to the hard-working and considerate Catherine. The Odd Jobs Trio on the other hand find themselves under a tighter budget and constant hunger thanks to Kagura’s hearty appetite. Meanwhile, a string of robberies occur in the downtown district. One day, the police make a visit to the Otose Snack House to gather any information regarding the recent robberies.\nSource: crunchyroll",
