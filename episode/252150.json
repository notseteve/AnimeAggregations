  "description" : "The KANAE system was based on artificial intelligence that was developed by Kanae, who was Koki and Asumi`s mother. In the past, the same AI was installed on a vehicle that got into an accident leaving 0th and Tsuzuragawa injured. 0th is suffering from the after effects of this accident caused by the faulty judgment of the AI, and has developed dyslexia. Kanae racks her brains to come up with a solution, but is told that there is a fundamental flaw in her system. After hearing that 0th has gotten into graffiti, she gives up on development. The 24th Ward has been developing steadily, but after Kanae`s death, the fate of the city changes drastically.\nSource: crunchyroll",
