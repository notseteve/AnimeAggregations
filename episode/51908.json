  "description" : "The 999 enters into a warp at high speed to make up for a large amount of lost time. But, the flow of time inside the warp is messed up and they encounter a 999 from a different time! They suffer a minor accident. On the 999 from the past, or maybe the future, is Maetel, the Conductor, and a young boy who looks similar to Tetsuro, named Redril. Redril has the same warrior`s gun as Tetsuro. Then they head towards a drifting planet where a new danger awaits!\nSource: crunchyroll",
