  "description" : "In a flashback, Marco and Ai are abandoned children who meet in the commercial tower, grow up in Kamado`s orphanage and eventually fall in love. Yuki chooses to take Yuno`s hand, while Marco and Ai run to the crumbling tower`s roof with Yuki`s father, intending to jump off with parachutes. Yuno catches up to them and once again tries to fight them alone, while Yuki hides and attempts to help her with his diary`s predictions. Yuno loses and has her phone taken away, but it turns out to be Marco and Ai`s decoy, which distracts them with false predictions. As a result, Yuno manages to critically injure Ai. Yuki`s father grabs one of the two parachutes and escapes the tower, but he runs into Yuki`s mother, who has been informed of the situation by Nishijima. When she threatens to turn him in, he stabs her. Yuki, Yuno and a dying Ai are trapped in the wreckage, but Marco attempts to free Ai despite having been mortally wounded himself. With Yuki and Yuno`s help, the debris is cleared out and Marco and Ai die together as the tower collapses. Yuki and Yuno escape using the second parachute, only to find that Yuki`s mother has died. Meanwhile, Nishijima has been unable to find Kamado`s Future Diary server.",
