  "description" : "Shouken encourages Ki to seek becoming the head of the Tanmoku family so he can fulfill his wishes; however, when Ki is promoted to the position there are many who oppose him. Ki, who doesn`t want to be hated by anyone, puts on a smiling face, but since his kind nature has already been taken advantage of before, Shouken advises Ki to refrain from smiling too much for his own sake. To cheer him up, Shouken asks Ki what he really wants to do and throws his full support behind making it happen, but when Ki`s desires land them in hot water Shouken`s future with Ki is placed in jeopardy.\nSource: crunchyroll",
