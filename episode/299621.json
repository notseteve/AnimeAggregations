  "description" : "“I will finally! Do! The laundry tomorrow!” Morihito declared. It’s been one year since he’s been lovingly wearing his denim jeans, and will now perform a second wash. Morihito has a personality that gets very dedicated to his hobbies, so having heard very long lectures on the topic, Nico and Kanshi try to stay out of it. However, Miharu has never seen Morihito so fired up, and dares to ask him, “Please tell me more about denim.”\nSource: Crunchyroll",
