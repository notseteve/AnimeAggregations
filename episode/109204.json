  "description" : "Mom spots a large bald spot on the back of Bunji`s head. The Spirit of Early Education freaks Mom out when he tells her that it`s a boy`s spirit callingfor help due to being neglected by his parents. Mom tried to improve her lax attitude towards Bunji, but...; Bunji can`t calm down and can`t sit still for lunch or going to the bathroom. That behavior just makes his school teacher say that \"Bunji sure has a strong sense of curiosity.\" Mom was impressed by this, but...; Mom goes to wake Fumi up after sending Bunji off to school. She is enticed by Fumi`s comfortable bed and drifts off to sleep herself, to the sound of Fumi`s breathing. She drifts off to dreamland. Then, Bunji, Ma, and Chi engage in a never-ending argument about peppers, which, incidentally, they all hate.\nSource: crunchyroll",
