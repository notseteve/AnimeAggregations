  "description" : "Guard Captain Berthold decides to swing by Nobu with his subordinate, Hans, in tow. There, he orders a chicken dish in order to see just how good Nobuyuki’s skills as a chef really are. In the ancient city of Aitheria, chicken dishes are typically dismissed as universally terrible.\nWithout a single moment of hesitation, Chief Nobu starts marinating the chicken using a dark colored sauce before dropping them into a pan filled with oil. Berthold can barely hold his appetite together at the sounds of the sizzling meat being cooked.\nSource: crunchyroll",
