  "description" : "Monsters attack Yoko and Rakushun on their way to En Kingdom.  When Yoko sees people push their way through to survive, she realizes she cannot live for others.  After defeating the monsters, Yoko finds Rakushun on the ground and gets an evil idea to finish him off so he won’t report her to the police.  She escapes but Aozaru accuses her and forces her to face her own demon.  When she realizes the true meaning of trust, she successfully slashes Aozaru.  Yoko goes back to save Rakushun and runs into the group of Shu-Sei she met before.  She takes a trip with them like a new person and reaches a harbor to get on the ship to En.\nSource: crunchyroll",
