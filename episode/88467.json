  "description" : "After Lawrence procures a certificate from the guildmaster, he goes to an armor company to sell his armor. To his horror, he discovers that the armor market has crashed and that he now holds a very large debt and worthless goods. Faced with an ultimatum to pay back the debt in two days or be rendered bankrupt and thus be thrown out of society entirely, Lawrence desperately tries to find merchants willing to lend him money, but each and every one turns him down. He realizes the merchants are unwilling to aid him because of his unmarried relationship with Holo, and, in a fit of rage, takes out his frustration on her. Even after Lawrence tries to apologize to her, Holo tells him that she is heading back to the inn for now.\nSource: Wikipedia",
