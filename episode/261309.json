  "description" : "\"Now that I figured it all out, I`m not scared of anything!\"\nGaku and Ruka from ROCK DOWN are scheduled to costar in a new stage production of the Botan chapter of the Tsukihana Kagura series. The two meet their childhood friends Eita and Yuta for a housewarming party at Yuta`s new apartment and the four get carried away with stories of the old days. Eita and Yuta remember how an invitation from Ruka led to Gaku`s debut as a performer. Ruka realizes that Gaku is his `rival` in a sense, but Gaku doesn`t seem to care. Ruka starts to feel frustrated at Gaku`s apparent indifference.\nSource: crunchyroll",
