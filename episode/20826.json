  "description" : "While on a walk with Laura, Hamtaro falls into a box on a transport truck in an attempt to save one of Laura`s ribbons and is taken away. Laura becomes very depressed. The Ham-Hams are also sad and enlist Elder-Ham`s help in the search. After receiving help from a man and his dog, Hamtaro meets up with Jingle, a new hamster named Sabu, his bird Francoise, and Jingle`s pig, Herbert. With their help, Hamtaro returns home and makes the Ham-Hams happy and, most of all, Laura. \nSource: Wikipedia",
