  "description" : "Prince Hata makes yet another visit to Edo. Heartbroken over the loss of Pes, the prince goes through every Edo city zoo determined to find the next cutest pet. Meanwhile, savoring her pickled seaweed, Kagura comes across a box left in front of the Odd Jobs Gin building. Her face lights up with a big smile when she finds an adorable animal in the box. The animal is a slightly…no, VERY big dog-like creature. Despite Gintoki’s protests, Kagura insists on keeping it. Kagura names the dog Sadaharu and plays rough with it, while Gintoki and Shinpachi grow exhausted from Sadaharu’s constant biting. What will Gintoki and Shinpachi do?\nSource: crunchyroll",
