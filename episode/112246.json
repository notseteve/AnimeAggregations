  "description" : "At a shrine in Kabukicho there exists a nesting ground for cats. The Odd Jobs gang hide themselves in the bushes to observe the stray cats feeding themselves. The cats soon run off, and a single cat enters from the Torii side. The torn ears and huge barrel-like body identify the cat as Hoichi, Kabukicho’s boss cat. The Odd Jobs were requested by the neighborhood association to capture Hoichi. Shinpachi and Kagura jump out to catch Hoichi with a net, but the cat easily escapes them. Kagura and Shinpachi ask Gintoki to help out, when they realize Gintoki has mysteriously disappeared!\nSource: crunchyroll",
