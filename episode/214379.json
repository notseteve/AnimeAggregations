  "description" : "\"I`ll just have to punch the crap out of Hijikata-san when he does show up.\" Captain of the 1st division of the Shinsengumi, Okita Soji, keeps mentally going over what happened during the Susanoo Incident when Hijikata went missing. While looking for the chronometer, Soji and the Shinsengumi once again encounter Takasugi and the others. A space-time rift opens up during this encounter and Soji is sucked into it. When Okita awakens, he finds himself in a Kyoto without the giant castle of Susanoo in the distance. He is standing before another Ikedaya when he hears a very familiar voice call out, \"We`re here on official business!\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
