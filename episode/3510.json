  "description" : "Meiling flew all the way here from Hong Kong just for a day so that Xiaolang could tell her something important in person. Everyone was so excited to be able to see her again! We decided to get some juice near Penguin Park to celebrate, but all of a sudden, the penguin statues in the park came to life and attacked us! It`s a good thing Meiling was there with her martial arts, because Sakura was too surprised to react and would have been smashed! I think that was when Meiling realized that Xiaolang really liked Sakura. Meiling was pretty upset and spent the night at my place before she went home, so I got to comfort her.\nSource: crunchyroll",
