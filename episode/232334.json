  "description" : "Just as Professor Cerise tells our heroes that the presence of a Legendary Pokémon has been detected nearby, thunder strikes, and Goh is certain that can mean only one thing: Zapdos! A blackout adds to that evidence, and when Ash and Goh visit the Power Plant, Goh is proven correct! After briefly (and unsuccessfully) joining forces with Team Rocket, our heroes battle the Legendary Pokémon! Of course, Goh tries to catch it, but it breaks free—and before flying away, it shares some of its electricity with the Electric-type Pokémon gathered nearby. Later, Professor Cerise shares his theory: Zapdos had been using the Power Plant to recharge its own electricity!\nSource: Official Website",
