  "description" : "The competition for the five second year training roles in the much-anticipated school musical \"Shadow & Lights\" is set to begin. This time, however, the boys are being mentored by former alumni who know the musical better than anyone. These experienced graduates are known as the Ancients and include former members of the Kao Council from Tsukigami Kaito`s older brother`s generation. Hoshitani and the others are ready to take on the challenge but one student, Ageha Riku of Team Yuzuriha, will stop at nothing to follow in the footsteps of his idol, Tsukigami Haruto. A new set of trials begin as each boy longs to stand in the spotlight alongside their admired mentors.\nSource: crunchyroll",
