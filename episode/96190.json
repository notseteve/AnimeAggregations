  "description" : "Felli has taken a part-time job as a waitress at a maid café at Sharnid`s suggestion, and one day he brings Layton to see her. Like most nen`i operators she almost never smiles, and as such she intimidates the patrons, until the restaurant owner gives her a new maid uniform that emphasises her cool and aloof persona. Layton and Sharnid stay at a building across the street from the café in an attempt to capture Felli smiling, but she later catches them and punishes them.\nFelli looks for a different part-time job and overhears the three girls, Mai, Miffy, and Naruki, talking about one that involves investigating an abandoned building. She joins them that night to explore it and they are attacked by a strange monster that appears to have been the by-product of earlier experiments in creating anti-contaminoid weapons, known as the Guardian Project. A military arts student who was assigned to inspect the building from time to time comes by as the three girls are captured. Felli manages to use her nen`i powers to cause a portion of the ceiling to collapse on top of the monster, allowing the other student to destroy it.",
