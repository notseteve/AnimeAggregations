  "description" : "It`s the finals against Oobi Middle with Mayumura Michiru and three other formidable players. As Fuurin`s starting pitcher Nishina pitches with all his might from the beginning, he runs out of stamina and coupled with defense bloopers, they lose 5 runs in the bottom of the third inning. Instead of letting Nishina continue, Chisato from center field takes over in the 4th inning. Though she has some experience from her time at Yokohama Littles, this is the first time in middle school. Her father is over-excited in the stands, but what kind of pitching performance will Chisato give?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
