  "description" : "Arata`s playing becomes reminiscent of Eternal Master Wataya Hajime`s, allowing him to take control of the match`s pace. Harada recalls the one match he played against Hajime when he was young and becomes painfully aware of how much his game sense has faded since then. But he sticks with the offensive play style that he teaches in the Shiranami Society, turning the match around in a way that leaves everyone in the hall holding their breath.\nSource: crunchyroll",
