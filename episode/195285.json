  "description" : "The Eiko-loving Kamuri is thrilled when she gets a middle school-era photo of her. However, the Eiko in the photo doesn`t look like the Eiko Kamuri saw in passing one year earlier. And yet, Eiko confirms that it is indeed her in the picture. Unsatisfied with the lingering mystery, Kamuri talks to Hana who recalls that she recently saw a girl who looked a lot like Eiko in the shopping district. The two are intrigued by the possibility of a look-alike and set off in search of Eiko`s secret.\nSource: crunchyroll",
