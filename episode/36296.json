  "description" : "Final Mova turns into a giant nut-like entity. As if they`re responding to Cosmo`s prayers, the Chaos Emeralds get back their power once again, and Super Sonic and Super Shadow stand tall, shining in gold. The duo`s fierce attacks destroy the outer layer of the nut, finally blowing it up into pieces, but this is not at all the end of their problems. Cosmo learns of her true purpose and Tails is forced to make a difficult decision.\nSource: Wikipedia",
