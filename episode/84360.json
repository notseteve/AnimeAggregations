  "description" : "Shou declares that he`ll take over the Duel from Ryou. He practices using Ryou`s deck, but it doesn`t go well. Juudai appears before Shou to tell him, \"you can`t just try to copy Ryou. That deck`s fought alongside Ryou all this time. It`ll see through anyone trying to copy him. Listen to the deck and make it your own.\" Shou and Inotsume face off. At first, Shou fights using the same tactics as his older brother, and Inotsume fights the same way he did before. Then, Shou summons Cyber Dark Dragon and Inotsume special summons Psycho Shocker.\nSource: crunchyroll",
