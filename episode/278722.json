  "description" : "Information gets out that Kanda, an anti-magic advocate and Diet member, will visit First High School with the media to observe the school`s curriculum, claiming that he has heard disturbing rumors about it. He plans to create an uproar with the media and assert that the school is brainwashing students into the military - if he finds anything suspicious of that nature. To stop this ploy, Tatsuya suggests performing an experiment showing the students creating a Sustained Gravity Control-Type Magic Thermonuclear Fusion Reactor = Stellar Furnace. The students plan on demonstrating that the magic education they receive at the school can solve energy problems, and that magic can contribute to the peace of humankind depending on the type of magic they use.\nSource: crunchyroll",
