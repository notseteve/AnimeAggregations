  "description" : "While reading reading her favorite “Monthly Thief Magazine,” Reinya spots a fortune telling her to steal something that drives married women wild for good luck and begins planning her next burglary.\nUp above in the convenience store, the three idiot police arrive. Too busy reading to deal with customers, Reinya sends Chutaro to deal with them, and his apathy drives her crazy. Reinya reluctantly heads to the register, driving the Detective into his world of delusion as he expresses his love for Reina with exaggerated gestures.\nSource: crunchyroll",
