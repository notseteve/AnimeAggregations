  "description" : "One of the programs Sakura always watches on TV is about famous castles, because she dreams of living like a princess, I came over to her house the day after she watched one such program, to take her measurements for a new battle costume I was making fr her. While I was there, Sakura sensed a Clow Card inside the house! She tracked it to her father`s room, but the Little card made Sakura tiny and she got blown out the window. Kero and I couldn`t find her anywhere, but thanks to my good acting, Toya and Yukito had no idea she was missing. After being chased by a cat and praying mantis outside. Sakura managed to make her way back into the house. With Kero`s help, she was able to turn back to normal, and the seal card away.\nSource: crunchyroll",
