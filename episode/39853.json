  "description" : "Having lost Mayama from the Fujiwara Design Office, Miwako expresses her depression by buying a massage chair for their new office. Yamada, who was brooding over the proposal of her childhood friends, confronts them and turns them down properly, later wishing for their own happiness while selling cakes with Hagu. Meanwhile, Takemoto is being depressed from the fact that he has not realized yet what his goal in life really is, giving him trouble on his job applications. He then took down the artwork he made for the art exhibition, much to a surprise for the others. His depression made the opening of their Christmas party a little dull, but Professor Hanamoto`s antics made things lively. Rebuilding another artwork for his graduation art project, Takemoto suddenly collapses and is brought to the hospital to be diagnosed for an ulcer. Visited by Mitsuko and Kazuo, he decides to stay and study for another year. Takemoto was about to confess his feelings to Hagu when they were interrupted by Professor Hanamoto, who has brought him a handheld television. What they saw on television totally surprises them. \nSource: Wikipedia",
