  "description" : "The B team ends the match with Tama Sports U. Next match is against Musashino, currently the first place of the League and also Tachibana`s old team. However, Tachibana doesn`t feel confident enough to play since he hasn`t had notable achievements in the League so far, and asks Date not to play him in the match against Musashino. Ashito and others bring Tachibana along to observe Musashino`s game. Team Musashino, which includes Kaneda and Nakano, who played alongside Ashito at the tryouts, displays an incredible play.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
