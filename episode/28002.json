  "description" : "Nuclear tests are being repeatedly performed on the earth. Taking these incidents very seriously, the \"Galactic League\" sends the Amazing 3 to the earth as an investigation troop. They are given orders to immediately destroy the earth if it is considered a dangerous planet that can possibly threaten peace in the galaxy. Under such orders, the Amazing 3 (Bokko, Bukko, and Nokko) embark on their mission by disguising themselves as a rabbit, horse, and a duck respectively. But the three have their escape route cut off after becoming trapped in a mountain fire. It is a tenderhearted boy named Shinichi who saves the three.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
