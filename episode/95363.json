  "description" : "Christmas season has arrived. Kouichi is invited to a party Risako is organizing. Kouichi finds out that the JUDA task force is also preparing a Christmas party. Unlike Kouichi, who feels unenthusiastic about this “workplace” party, it is more of a family party for most of the members who consider JUDA their home.\nThe party mood is suddenly interrupted by the news of an American satellite weapon being taken over by the KATO-KIKAN. This would allow the KATO-KIKAN to attack any part of the world. Assigned to shoot down the satellite weapon, Kouichi and Yamashita head into outer space!\nSource: crunchyroll",
