  "description" : "The seventh Day of Judgment has arrived, and the final Septentrion appears, leaving a path of destruction in its wake. With Hibiki still in a coma following the previous day`s encounter, Daichi and the others -- armed with a newly redesigned summoning app -- will band together in an effort to stop it. But their confidence is shaken when all of them receive dead face clips, and the enemy reveals it has a disruption wave that can prevent their demons from being summoned.  Will a last-minute arrival be enough to turn the tide of battle?\nSource: crunchyroll",
