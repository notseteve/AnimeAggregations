  "description" : "Kimihito receives a second threatening letter, more poetic than the first, and the members of MON go on a date with him in a final attempt to smoke out the writer. After a number of embarrassing situations with them they notice someone following, and it turns out to be none other than Doppel, who wrote the first letter in an attempt to make Kimihito`s love progress towards one of the girls, but it instead caused his relationships to all of them to deepen. She did not write the second letter though.\nOn his way home Kimihito is confronted by a headless woman, whom he brings home, and was apparently the author of the second letter. The girls help him look for her head, except for Rachnera and Suu, who remain behind to watch her body. They eventually find the disembodied head in the park, which makes strange noises as Rachnera and Suu molest her body. She is a dullahan, which supposedly appears when someone is about to die, and later implies that Kimihito is the one who will soon die.",
