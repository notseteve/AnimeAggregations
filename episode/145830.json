  "description" : "Araragi, initially ignoring Oshino`s warning not to involve himself any further in this incident, visits Hanekawa`s house and is shocked by what he finds. He returns home and convinces his sisters not to involve themselves in the Curse Cat incident either. A few days pass and Hanekawa is still nowhere to be found. Araragi returns to Oshino to find him severely injured from his numerous encounters with the Curse Cat. Later, Araragi manges to find and talk to the Curse Cat occupying Hanekawa. Calmer and less violent now, she tells him to leave her to her own devices in order to relieve her master`s stress.",
