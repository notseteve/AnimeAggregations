  "description" : "The tournament continues, with Tamaki seemingly in trouble with the other team`s treacherous plots. Konishi, a girl from the Tozyo High kendo club, purposely causes Tamaki to trip over tennis balls, inflicting an injury on her foot. Meanwhile, Azuma encounters a little bit of stomach troubles, ending her match in a tie, and Miyako is continuously haunted by Reimi`s face, ending her match in a loss. Sayako does her duty to relieve Kirino`s burden, and Kirino does her part as the team`s captain. When Tamaki steps up, she has a little payback in store for Konishi.\nSource: Wiki",
