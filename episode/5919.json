  "description" : "Continuing on from the previous episode, Gan-chan is launched into space by Urd and Skuld in a Saturn-style rocket. He orbits around Earth before performing a moon landing, quoting Neil Armstrong`s famous line. He plants a flag and takes a moon rock before returning to his ship. Urd and Skuld convince him to fly to deep space, but they leave him when Belldandy announces that dinner is ready, leaving Gan-chan alone in deep space.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
