  "description" : "Hank and Schaal head to the border on a steam locomotive. The steel bridge that goes over the border’s valley is the largest in the continent. It connects the North and the South and is called the bridge of peace that would support the generations to come. However, it seems that the Incarnate Behemoth, formerly Arthur Allston, is slowly marching towards that bridge. Hank was called to stop him. Will Hank be able to stop the Incarnate Behemoth, even though he seems invincible against a barrage of bullets?\nSource: crunchyroll",
