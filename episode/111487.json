  "description" : "Once Kajika and the others escaped the palace and safely made it back to the hideout, they learn that Rumaty has returned to the country. Kakija fearing for Rumaty’s safety tells the others that she wants to go get him at the airport. The people around Kajika are fervently against the idea because they know about her secret. Lee-Leng heads over to the airport leaving Kajika at the hideout. In the meantime, the Palace of Raginei has become Quinza’s own, awaiting Rumaty’s return. Suddenly an envelope makes it to Quinza from Carl’s sister revealing the truth about Kajika’s lineage.\nSource: crunchyroll",
