  "description" : "Xiaolang still didn`t seem to be able to get Sakura out of his head. Which makes sense since she`s so adorable! But he didn`t know why she was always on his mind, and seemed troubled by it. Eriol, Sakura, Xiaolang and I went to see the Teddy Bear Exhibit and I noticed that Xiaolang was always keeping an eye on Sakura. When I mentioned it, Xiaolang got embarrassed and wanted to go home, but instead, he and Sakura got stuck in the elevator together! Sakura said that she fell out of the elevator down the shaft, but used the Float card to save herself. Xiaolang was really worried about her though... I think the look cute together.\nSource: crunchyroll",
