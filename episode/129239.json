  "description" : "Toriko is commissioned by the International Gourmet Organization to obtain the Rainbow Fruit, which is guarded by powerful Troll Kongs. As he and Komatsu make their way into the enclosed Biotope, news reporter Tina sneaks in to try and get footage of Toriko in action. Toriko encounters a scout and knocks him out with a stun gun, since he does not kill what he does not intend to eat, though gets licked with its scent. Toriko soon encounters a group of Troll Kongs guarding the Rainbow Fruit tree. As Toriko confronts them, the rain washes off the scent from the underling, allowing him to use his intimidation against the others and gain dominance over its leader. Toriko takes a single fruit, though Tina is caught and her footage is confiscated. Moved by the ever-changing flavors of the Rainbow Fruit, served in a jelly by Komatsu, Toriko declares the Rainbow Fruit as the dessert for his full-course menu. Meanwhile, various shady figures become interested in Toriko`s movements.\nSource: Wikipedia",
