  "description" : "Ash and Goh are embarking on their first full day as research fellows at Professor Cerise`s Laboratory, and the excitement starts right away! There’s an outbreak of Ivysaur and Bulbasaur in Vermilion City, and armed with their new Rotom Phones, our heroes set out to investigate. It turns out the Pokémon are trying to reach a favorite sunbathing spot, but the land is now a construction site for a Gym. Ash and Goh follow as the Pokémon climb the Gym tower—but Team Rocket isn’t far behind! Ash, Pikachu, and the Ivysaur send the trio packing…and then our heroes watch in awe as the triumphant Ivysaur evolve into Venusaur!\nSource: Official Website",
