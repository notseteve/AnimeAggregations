  "description" : "Raul has never once contacted his family in the countryside since leaving for the city to become a hero, so his sister Myuri comes by to see him. He cannot tell her outright that he failed to become a hero and so with the help of Sarah and the rest of the employees of Leon comes up with a ruse to make her think he succeeded, as the rather backward people in his village would not understand. He meets her at the train station in full battle gear, just as Fino appears in her demon lord getup, saying that she is holding \"Princess Sarah\" captive at the \"Three Great Hells\". He lets Myuri come with him so she can see her brother in action.\nThe \"Three Great Hells\" turns out to be a hot spring resort. At the first stop they see Nova covered in sand with a flag on top of one of her breasts, and Lore challenges him to a \"duel\" which involves removing as much sand from off her body without letting the flag fall. He eventually manages to prevail despite the rather embarrassing position. Next he fights a duel with Airi at one of the hot spring pools, where he manages to cut off all her clothes. Next they reach the \"final hell\" where Ram and Elsa wait with a washing machine in the centre of which produces a great whirlpool, which he manages to counter with Airi`s help.\nThey find \"Princess Sarah\" chained to a rock in the middle of a botanical garden, and set her free, but Fino is behind with a huge carnivorous plant that proves to be stronger than they bargained. It quickly traps all the girls, and Raul has difficulty fighting it off, until Myuri uses her considerable magical power to break free and give power to Raul`s sword, enabling them to defeat it.",
