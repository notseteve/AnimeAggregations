  "description" : "Medhi decides to come along with Masato and the party. They all get a notice about a new “tower dungeon”, which will grant any wish to those who can get to the top. The party heads to the town of Ommym, where the dungeon awaits. As soon as they arrive, a group of mothers begs them to look for their children. Shirase says that this isn’t part of any event, however. They decide to investigate the dungeon  with her. As they get past the traps and the monsters, they’re met by a woman dressed like a gladiator.\nSource: crunchyroll",
