  "description" : "Kosuri also gets Tanukichi to leave the bus, and she and White Peak bring their bus to Zoshigaoka Academy, where White Peak, in his guise as the student Ichinose Takuma, studies. Moist Throng has taken about 500 hostages and the PMC has besieged the campus. They have demanded food and drink for the hostages as well as a mass of new panties, threatening to publish compromising pictures of the hostages otherwise. Kosuri soon realises that she made a mistake betraying SOX for them, as she learns that Takuma and Moist Throng are not the revolutionaries looking to change the country she thought them to be, but just common perverts out to sate their lusts until the PMC decides to break through. She is bound and gagged as a hostage after she unsuccessfully attacks him.\nMeanwhile Tanukichi and Ayame get in contact with each other and formulate a new plan. They receive a call from Saotome who is among the hostages, and she provides intelligence on the conditions inside the school. Although Tanukichi has his reservations about this plan which goes against his ethics, he disguises his scent by constantly washing himself and goes to Anna, convincing her to temporarily ally with SOX to defeat Moist Throng and retrieve his underwear which they have stolen. Anna, Gouriki, and Oboro join Ayame and Tanukichi and together they manage to defeat Moist Throng.",
