  "description" : "Yoko’s Hinman power saves herself and her friends from the monsters’ attack.  They are starving and hesitantly break into a farm house to steal food.  The owner of the house, Takki, comes back and gives them food and clothes.  When Takki promises a town job for them, Yoko trusts her but Sugimoto is skeptical.  They leave for the town and see a play about Kei Kingdom on the way.  Towards the end of the play, Yoko sees Aozaru, which used to be in her nightmare, play Yoko’s father and mother, and that deeply affects Yoko’s mind.\nSource: crunchyroll",
