  "description" : "This episode begins with Mubyou running from an unknown attacker who is wearing an owl mask that much resembles a raccoon and a black cloak and is asking for the Reverse Circle (Also known as Sakasaen). The attacker uses a weapon that resembles blue wire. Mubyou, in a desperate effort to get away, throws out the brown wolf puppet which transforms into a guardian wolf, which the attacker shreds into small pieces. The next day, the Owl-Masked Figure meets Kou outside the house where she asks to meet with the Head of the Miduchi. During the meeting, the cloaked figure reveals that she is the god of a nearby land and that the Sakasaen is a treasure of her land which belongs to her, not Mubyou. Kuu agrees to help this god find Mubyou and help take back the Reverse Circle; they believe she fled to Suzunose. After an unsuccessful day of searching, Kuu and the Owl-Masked God battle one-on-one. Kuu gives Toru a green bracelet which resembles the one made from her hair. Noboru and Kou spend their evening at a park setting off fireworks; Kou blesses cursed men and receives alcohol in return. Mubyou tricks Toru into following her away from Kuu and puts the Reverse Circle around his neck. Kou is shown drunk at the end of this episode.\nSource: crunchyroll",
