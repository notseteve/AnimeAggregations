  "description" : "The Scout Regiment reaches the Shiganshina District in Wall Maria, planning to retake it and search Eren`s basement. They are unsettled at how deserted Shiganshina District seems, with no Titans in sight, and how Eren is easily able to plug the hole in the outer wall with his Titan hardening. Before he can plug the inner wall, Armin discovers a recent campsite; remembering that they found Titans inside the walls, he has the soldiers search for wall cavities. Sure enough, Reiner bursts from a hole in the wall and transforms into the Armored Titan. The Scouts find themselves surrounded by the Beast Titan with an army of Titans. The Beast Titan seals the inner entrance with a boulder, trapping the horses within Shiganshina and preventing the soldiers from using them to escape.",
