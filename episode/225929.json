  "description" : "A client, Youko, says her hands have been \"stolen.\" On her neck are clear marks from where she strangled herself with her own hands. Daddy Eyeball believes it`s the work of Te-no-me, but he has some doubts because Te-no-me is a youkai that usually only plays pranks. A string of suspicious deaths begins. Kitaro realizes that all the victims had their hands \"stolen\" by Te-no-me just like Youko. In the midst of Kitaro`s confusion, Nurarihyon appears before him. What could Te-no-me`s aim be? And what are Nurarihyon`s motives?\nSource: crunchyroll",
