  "description" : "The summer tournament is in full swing and Seido is playing their second game against Hachiya Oji and their skilled second baseman Kawabata.  Furuya is the starting pitcher and has recovered nicely, throwing howling fastballs in the first inning.  But Hachiya Oji has been expecting them, and third batter Kawabata hits one which nearly sails into near center field, but Haruchi and Kuramochi are there to stop it!\nSource: crunchyroll",
