  "description" : "Just as things are getting desperate and it looks like Seitou is going to be killed by Fuuki, she is saved by Haku Gessho. Seitou and Suusu are whisked away by the mysterious fox spirit woman to watch the fight unravel from a safe distance, but Seitou is unable to sit still and goes after Fuuki again. All attempts to make Fuuki remember his past life and the time he and Seitou spent together seem to not matter as he continues to attack Seitou. In desperation Seitou puts her own life on the line to remind her former lover of how much they once meant to each other.\nSource: crunchyroll",
