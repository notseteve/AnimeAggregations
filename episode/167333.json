  "description" : "Kagami Jun`ichirou is a 24-year old otaku who spends most of his time updating his anime blog and hasn`t worked properly in well over a year. He is afflicted with what he calls \"YD\" (yaritai koto shika dekimasu byou -- やりたいことしかできない病, lit. `I can only do what I feel like doing disease`) which has him able to do only things he feels like doing. However, once he sets his mind to doing something he can accomplish truly remarkable things, e.g. he managed to get papers on physics published in major scientific journals at the age of seventeen. His sister Suzune, fed up with him, has forcibly applied him to the high school he graduated from as a teacher.\nHe meets a student named Kanou Minako who aspires to become an anime voice actress, whom he nicknames `Face Puncher` (顔面パンチ ganmen panchi) after she punches him in the face for insulting her ambitions. He realises that she is being bullied, and saves her from a molester after the bullies create a profile for her on the school`s social website saying that she is a loose girl. He later turns the tables on her bullies by humiliating them in turn.",
