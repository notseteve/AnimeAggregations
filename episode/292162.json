  "description" : "Gakuto receives an offer to perform at a jazz concert in the US. While Gakuto can perform the way he wants to overseas, Homare, Izumi, Jun, and Kanata can`t do the things they want to work on. The four other members are aware that Gakuto is important to the group and thus put in more effort to make up for the fact that Gakuto isn`t around at the moment. While this is happening, all of JAXX/JAXX`s five members have an upcoming shoot for a live Buzz Variety dance project. They are determined to do their best as a group when Lin informs them about something.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
