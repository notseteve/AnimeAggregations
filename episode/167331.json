  "description" : "Koyomi explains to Kagami why she decided to scout him as a teacher for her school, saying that she finds him interesting. Suzune goes to Icho Academy, a branch of Hiiragi Academy, and she explains how most of the students there are are extremely talented who also tend to be more than a little crazy and highly eccentric. When Koyomi comes to see him at home, Kagami has escaped, and has gone to Akihabara, and her men try to look for him. He gets caught by Suzune, who realises he has gone to the district to get an autograph of the voice actress of one of his favourite anime characters.\nThus forcibly dragged to Hiiragi Academy, he meets some of the students, the uptight student council and discipline committee head Momozono Makina, whom he nicknames `Unusual Twintails` (変則ツインテール, henzoku twintail), who dislikes Kagami and disagrees with the headmaster`s decision to hire him. He sees a girl leaving who has been expelled from school for working part-time in violation of the school rules. The girl, named Shikishima Kiriko, was working in an Akihabara Maid Café, and her case convinces him to accept teaching at Hiiragi Academy.",
