  "description" : "After returning from his trip to Arcanretia, Kazuma is living life without a care in the world, thanks to his debts being all paid off by the reward money he earned from eliminating one of the Devil King`s generals, Hans. One day, a rookie adventurer named Ran comes up to him in the Guild Hall asking for a handshake. She`s apparently become a fan of Kazuma after his consecutive defeat of the Devil King`s generals! This puts him in an amazing mood, but it`s not long before the Guild receptionist Luna appears, asking him to take on a quest to eliminate a golem. Wanting to look good in front of a fan, Kazuma ends up accepting, and heads towards ancient ruins with Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness in tow.\nSource: crunchyroll",
