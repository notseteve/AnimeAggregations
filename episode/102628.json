  "description" : "Haruhi becomes frustrated and jealous of Mikuru`s friendly relationship with Kyon. One night, Haruhi`s power is activated without her knowing, and both she and Kyon become trapped in a sealed reality at their school. Before long, a blue giant appears and begins to destroy the school and the surrounding area. As more appear, Kyon and Haruhi evacuate the school. Kyon uses hints, provided by Yuki and Mikuru beforehand, to defuse the situation and escape. In the end, he expresses his desire to return to the old world and kisses Haruhi, which brings the two back to the \"old world\". It remains unknown if the world that Kyon returns to is really the previous world, or if it is the new world that Haruhi created during their time inside closed space, though Yuki, Mikuru, and Itsuki are all glad to see Kyon again.",
