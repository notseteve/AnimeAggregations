  "description" : "Chiwa sees Eita and Masuzu walking together arms linked and she objects, saying that anyone who wants to date him should have her permission first, because she knows him best. Masuzu handles her intrusion with great finesse. She later tells Eita to bring Chiwa with him to the former tea club room, and there says that she is forming a new club called the \"Maiden`s Society For Performing Your Own Life\" (自らを演出する乙女の会, Mizukara wo Enshutsu-suru Otome no Kai), for girls to learn how to become popular. Chiwa is convinced to join. She tells Masuzu that she sort of has an interest in a member of the basketball team named Sakagami, and Masuzu suggests that she bring around an empty guitar case to give people the impression that she is into music and to attract the attention of Sakagami. Masuzu later asks Eita to be more serious with their pretence and not to look at other girls.",
