  "description" : "July carried Chifuyu on his back to her school before he met up with Kuki Madoka and proceed to go to go to his own school. Later, the club use Chifuyu`s \"World Create\" ability to dress up in various cosplay outfits, after which Chifuyu`s aunt, teacher Satomi Shiharu, mentions that Chifuyu had left school early. Later, Chifuyu shows up at July`s house after getting into a fight with her friend, Kuki Madoka, who told her not to spend time with the Literature Club anymore. Things get worse between them due to Chifuyu being unable to tell Madoka about her powers, leading her to believe she likes them more than her. July attempts his own dubious manner of trying to get the two to make up, but Chifuyu accomplishes this on her own by having Shiharu help her win Madoka a plush to match with hers. Afterwards, Chifuyu reveals that her wanting to quit elementary school was from a desire to skip grades and enter high school alongside the other members. \nSource: Wikipedia",
