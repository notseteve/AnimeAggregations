  "description" : "Team Rocket’s Matori has a big mission coming up, and she does not want any incompetence! The solution? Send Jessie, James, and Meowth (and Wobbuffet) on a vacation! They’re happy for a break, but just as they get settled in, the Twerps appear! Ash and Goh are searching for a giant Pokémon who’s rumored to live in a nearby lake—it turns out to be a Magikarp, who Goh catches with the disguised Team Rocket trio’s help! Then, Matori suddenly attacks, but the trio can’t stand seeing her get the upper hand, so they help Ash and Goh defeat her! Perhaps she’ll think twice before excluding them again?\nSource: Official Website",
