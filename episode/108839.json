  "description" : "Natsu caught up to Erigor after breaking through the magic wind wall, but Natsu`s flames aren`t able to dent Erigor`s perfectly controlled wind! Happy figures out wind`s weakness, however, and Natsu uses his Dragon Slayer magic to stage a sudden comeback! After Lucy and the others arrive, everything would seem to be safe, but Kage suddenly takes back the flute and heads towards the Guild Masters!  It`s just one setback after another; can they ever truly stop the lullaby?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
