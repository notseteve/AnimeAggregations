  "description" : "When Bunji hears \"Dogs rank themselves and the people around them,\" he instantly tries to act superior to Jon and triumphantly takes him out for a walk.  However... Bunji has mid-winter training with his karate dojo on the riverbed with a fierce winter wind blowing. With the rule being whoever says \"It`s cold\" gets penalized, the trio tries to mess with Bunji as usual. Dad is doing maintenance on his camera that he uses for work. He takes pictures of Bunji and Fumi when they run in, but since they are only familiar with digital cameras and cellphone photos, they think they can see the pictures right away... The most common images that Dad has taken are ones that show the smiles of children, like a flower in bloom, in the ruins of battle or in rubble.  No matter how terrible the situation, when you point the camera at them, the children will smile.\nSource: crunchyroll",
