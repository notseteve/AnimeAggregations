  "description" : "Rito is training hard to hopefully become the Greatest Man in the Universe and save his life in the process.  While out running, he bumps into Haruna walking her dog.  She becomes very supportive of Rito, even meeting up with him everyday as he runs.  Finally, Haruna asks Rito to have lunch with her by the river.  During their date, her dog falls into the water and is rescued by Rito.  Dripping wet, Haruna takes him to her house to dry his clothes.  There, Haruna trips and almost kisses a towel-clad Rito just as her sister enters the room.\nSource: crunchyroll",
