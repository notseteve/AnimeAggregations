  "description" : "During a visit to the Dejima Refugee Residential District off the coast of Nagasaki, Prime Minister Kayabuki receives a bouquet of flowers that is accompanied by an envelope stamped with the diamond seal seen in \"NATURAL ENEMY\". The envelope contains a letter that promises an attempt to take the Prime Minister`s life. At a meeting of the Prime Minister`s Cabinet, Aramaki is shown the letter and told that so far the stamp on the envelope has turned up in eight other terrorist incidents. The Cabinet calls for Section 9`s assistance. However, much to the unit members` chagrin, Section 9 will not be deployed in an offensive role.",
