  "description" : "When Triton and Pipi are heading for the Atlantic Ocean, they hear the echoing sound of a trumpet shell. They follow the sound and find Fin blowing into a shell. Triton is very happy to see Fin again, but then there appears an ancient dinosaur. The dinosaur seems to also be drawn to the sound of the trumpet shell, which Fin is blowing. The sound reminds the dinosaur of his fellows. Triton and Pipi become friends with the dinosaur. Then Polipeimos` men appear to attack them, but Triton beats them back. Poseidon does not forgive Polipeimos for his repeated failures, and orders his execution by Markus.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
