  "description" : "The Royal Knights arrive at Beanstalk Village where the captured children encountered an unconscious Mamemon.  Dynasmon locks Tommy and the children in a cell until they reveal where the “key” is. Meanwhile, Takuya and the gang make a ramp to cross the gap. Worm the Trailmon reveals that the route to Beanstalk Village is a very tough trek. And back at Mamemon Village, as the kids try and escape by throwing a bomb at the cell bars, Dynasmon grabs the Elder and forces them to tell the Royal Knights where the \"key\" is.\nSource: crunchyroll",
