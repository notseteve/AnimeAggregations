  "description" : "Gan-chan is having a bad day. Urd notices the ring Gan-chan has and asks Gan-chan if she can have it, and he gladly agrees. However, the bad luck almost immediately transfers to Urd, leading her to conclude that the diamond on the ring is cursed. They try to place a spiritual barrier on the ring, but it fails. The gang then attempts to exorcise the spirit in the ring, but a black cat emerges, gives them a business card, takes the ring, and leaves.\nSource: theTVDB.com",
