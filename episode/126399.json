  "description" : "On the way to school with Ringo and Natsuki, Leila seems odd. She totters about while mentioning that her head is heavy and her shoulders are stiff. It`s no wonder she feels this way as riding on her head is a plump Dai. His fatness has everyone surprised.  As they comment on it, Dai pulls out a biscuit and happily devours it. It seems he isn`t aware of it at all. However, Dai has become so fat that he can no longer fit into the dollhouse. Seeing Dai like this, Sei and Ryoku are angered as he is too pitiful for a Ma-Pet. After Leila also persuades him, Dai finally decides to go on a diet . Thus, Leila and Dai`s Super Diet Plan has begun.\nSource: crunchyroll",
