Shinobu continues to gather information, but shows concern for Jeanne when she uncovers the Azure Brigade`s suspicious activity. Meanwhile, a plague strikes the city. Its treatment is beyond the doctors of this other world, and with the group`s reserves of medical supplies running low, the patients are facing the risk of death.\nWhen the local Medical Guild comes to insult the Seven-Light Faith for failing to save their patients, Akatsuki gets mad. That`s when the world`s greatest doctor, Kanzaki Keine responds to his spirit and declares that she will make medicine to save them all.\nSource: crunchyroll",
