There they met SunSan, a Habanero flavored Starfish Zooble and a figure skater champion with a rather posh attitude. Later on, Chevy and her friends spied onto her to study her skills like Kumampa suggested. At the day of the competition, Chevy is doing her best to win, until she notices something wrong with SunSan during the competition itself.\nThe Cursed Stone: Chevy and her friends were rolling around so fast in candy land until they accidentally discovered a small shrine in the forest. Reel, a Soda Flavored Bird Zooble then appeared and warned them about the shrine, saying that whoever disturbs it will be turned to stone. Chevy and her Friends were cursed due to it, as they will be turned into stone until they told 10 of their friends to prevent it, but also causing a lot of chaos and confusion all over Candy Land. Em however knew that its just a rumor, but Chevy later finds out the stone in the shrine is actually Kumampa`s power stone.",
