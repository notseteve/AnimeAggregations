  "description" : "Schubert famously wrote a song called \"Demon King,\" but Botan believes that the Demon King in the story lacks the desired qualities of the real thing.  Sakura starts talking about other good stories in their textbook besides \"Kokoro,\" and starts remembering other works of literature she once read. The Going Home Club realizes that while they remember the stories of Momotaro and Urashimataro well, they`re hazy on the story of Kintaro.\nSource: crunchyroll",
