  "description" : "Kin-chan loses to Yuki Minaguchi. His right arm is back to full function but he`s overwhelmed by Yuki`s strength. Her next opponent is the Air Master. All the Fukamichi Ranking fans across the country have been awaiting this battle as the fight begins in earnest. Both Maki and Yuki try to end the fight with their special attack right at the start. But, they both notice the other`s attack and dodge. Yuki smiles happily at Maki and for the first time Maki feels terror throughout her body. The difference in emotion is apparent in the fight and Maki is handily being beaten. About to accept her own defeat, Maki suddenly hears Kaori Sakiyama`s loud yells! \"Are you running away?! What will you do then?!\" Maki, beaten ragged, stands up against Yuki saying, \"I won`t... lose. Fighting is all I know.\"\nSource: crunchyroll",
