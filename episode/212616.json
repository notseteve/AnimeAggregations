  "description" : "The Stand that attacked Narancia was named Crush and belonged to Squallo, a member of the boss`s elite guard. On top of that, Narancia suddenly can only say the exact opposite of what he`s thinking, thanks to the ability of Talking Mouth, the Stand of Squallo`s partner, Tiziano. Using Narancia, Squallo and Tiziano throw the team into chaos. The two elite guard members put Narancia in danger, but he boldly faces them so they can get out of Venice safely.\nSource: crunchyroll",
