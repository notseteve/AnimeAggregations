  "description" : "In the midst of desperation, Cestvs takes a chance on a one-in-a-million punch. His punch is effective, and he achieves victory over Emden. The mob calls for Emden`s death, but Sabina convinces them to settle down. She then tells Emden that this is goodbye. The victor secures his survival only once he has shattered the hope of his opponent with his own fists... The victory weighs heavily on Cestvs. Meanwhile, Zafar finds it odd that both Emden`s special technique and the technique he taught Cestvs have the same goal as well as name and goes to visit Emden. What truth will be revealed there?\nSource: crunchyroll",
