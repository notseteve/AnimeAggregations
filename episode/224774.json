  "description" : "It`s the final innings of the game against the Wynd Youth. Following Narumiya’s masterful relief pitching, the other Inashiro players, Carlos, Shirakawa and Yamaoka have really shone. Miyuki is reminded how imposing his rival team is. Meanwhile, in Seido’s practice game against Yamamori, Yui is wearing the catcher’s after Ono had to leave the field. Several walks and battery errors are making the game difficult. Yui blames himself for throwing off Furuya’s rhythm.\nSource: crunchyroll",
