  "description" : "Medhi was able to say what she felt about her mom when Masato was around, but in front of her mother, she always forced herself to act obedient. Wise and Porta both try to cheer her up and be her friend, but Medhimama, who wants a good daughter so that she can become “the number one mom”, refuses to let her have any friends. When Medhi realizes that her mother’s fanatacism was just for the sake of her own ego, she breaks down, lets her feelings loose, and becomes a powerful dragon. The party tries to stop her, but even in the middle of the fight, Medhimama is so obsessed with being number one that she challanges Mamako to a duel!\nSource: crunchyroll",
