  "description" : "Kenshiro`s group hears that Hyoh is exploiting villagers to bring back the birthplace of the North Star Lapis Lazuli Fist, the Holy Temple of Asura, from the bottom of a swamp. Kenshiro faces off with Hyoh, who has gone there and turned into a demon. While Kenshiro senses that Hyoh is his elder brother, Hyoh`s memories remain sealed and lost, and Hyoh, seeing Kenshiro only as Sayaka`s murderer, is consumed anew with vengeance. When Kaioh hears reports of the fighting, he lets out resounding laughter at how smoothly things are going for him.\nSource: crunchyroll",
