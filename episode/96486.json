  "description" : "Chihaya is having a block in her manga writing. Ibuki and Yoichi go for a spar in the dojo, with the small number of students and Ayame watching. After Yoichi damages her clothes she attacks him and her students become collateral damage. Ayame has a bath afterwards, and Chihaya comes by to see her, saying that she`ll check Yoichi out. She brings him into her room, showing him her manga drafts and explaining about her story, and then proceeds to come on to him. He kindly refuses her advances, but she tells him that she was just testing him. Ibuki saw them, and gives him a sound drubbing as usual. Chihaya however, later tells Ayame that Yoichi is a good man and she shouldn`t stop her feelings for him.\nThe next day Chihaya has supplementary review classes but has left her notebook at home, bringing her manga drafts instead, so Yoichi goes to her school to give it to her. He finds that she is being bullied by a group of students who cannot understand how she can be so passionate about her art. He confronts them and this escalates into a fight, and they are quickly defeated. Chihaya sees them beaten down and talks to them, saying that someday they`ll also find something they`ll be just as passionate about. Thus inspired by her experience of Yoichi she changes her manga character designs to resemble him more.",
