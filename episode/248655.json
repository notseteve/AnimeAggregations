  "description" : "The battle they just had at Grand Tower cast a shadow on Mirai and the others in many ways. Saki, who wasn`t able to participate in the fight, seems to be bothered by something. She then asks Mirai to kill her. Why was the kind and ordinary girl Saki chosen to be a God Candidate? Mirai finds out the truth and then asks Saki to make a certain choice. Meanwhile, high school student Kanade Uryu, who was actually Metropoliman, seems to be plotting his next move as well.\nSource: crunchyroll",
