  "description" : "Itami Youji is a 33-year old otaku who enlisted in the Japan Self-Defence Forces to support his hobby. He is in Ginza to attend a doujin event when what becomes known as the Gate opens, and warriors and monsters enter and attack the people. His presence of mind and valour in the face of the unprecedented events helped save the lives of many civilians, and he is acclaimed as the Hero of Ginza, and even receives a personal citation from the Prime Minister himself, and is promoted to second lieutenant. The mysterious Gate remains open, and while no more creatures have come in from the other side, the Japanese Government remains deeply concerned, and they assemble an expeditionary force to explore the mysterious land beyond the Gate. Youji is of course chosen to be part of this force.",
