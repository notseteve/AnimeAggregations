  "description" : "Cappy takes Bijou`s ribbon for a game of \"Blind Man`s Bluff\". Bijou blames Hamtaro for that. Snoozer comforts Bijou and convinces her to make up with Hamtaro. The Ham-Hams decide to find acorns and cheer her up during this time. Hamtaro sprains his foot and Bijou uses her ribbon to wrap it. Meanwhile, it`s a school trip. Laura puts ribbons in her hair and Travis doesn`t seem to notice until he acknowledges her without the ribbon. \nSource: Wikipedia",
