  "description" : "Dragon pilots from Tsuiki, Misawa and Iruma base have gathered at Gifu base for joint training including mimic battle. As soon as arrived, Hoshino Eru from Tsuiki base suggested a night-time training to get to know each other. She doesn`t like treating her dragon like a pet and keeps it disguising in the battle plane F-2A. On the other hand, Hitomi Mayumi is very slow and Kinutsugai Ririko fears catching others` eyes. Can Hisone get along with these unique dragon pilots?\nSource: Official page",
