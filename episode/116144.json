  "description" : "\"We`re now going to destroy the moon.\" That`s what Erza said all matter-of-fact in front of the villagers who are still stuck in the forms of demons even though Deliora has been defeated.  Combing the throwing power of the Giant Armor and the Lance of Haja that has the power to repel darkness with the hyper acceleration of Natsu`s flames, they make an all-out attack on the moon! Erza`s full of confidence, but there`s no way it could actually reach the moon... Wait, the moon actually cracked?! What could be the unexpected hidden truth behind it all?\nSource: crunchyroll",
