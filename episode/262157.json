  "description" : "In order to visit the Spirit King, Anos and his team continue to go through trials provided by the Great Tree Spirit Enyunien. The next trial, “The staircase of Geunier” is a trial where they must choose the 5 correct paths out of the 20 paths before them, which appears to be a game entirely dependent on luck. However, thanks to the advice from Lena, Anos and the team individually made their ways to the top. Lay and Misa arrive to the Spirit King’s castle first, and engage in the final trial!\nSource: crunchyroll",
