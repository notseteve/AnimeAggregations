  "description" : "Everyone decides to have a fun afternoon together at the water park.  However, Rito now has a new source of relationship drama: Run has fallen in love with him, too.  Through their whole afternoon, she tries everything she can imagine to get Rito’s attention.  From fishing poles to vacuums and even fabric-eating fish, each of her attempts ends in disaster for Rito.  She finally gets some advice from Montemitsu and Rito’s teacher, but finds herself in a spot of trouble with the other patrons of the park.  Rito steps in to help her and Lala whips out one of her new inventions.  Unfortunately for Rito, this is only the beginning of Run’s campaign for his affection.\nSource: crunchyroll",
