  "description" : "Xanxus’ hands are frozen by Tsuna`s Deathperate Zero Point Breakthrough: First Edition, a technique that seals away deathperation flames. Xanxus is furious that Tsuna can use the technique that the First Vongola boss used, but Tsuna calmly points out that Vongola IX hit him with the same technique. Xanxus doesn`t give up. Tsuna asks him why he`s mad, but Xanxus doesn`t give him an answer.  What happened in the Cradle Incident eight years ago? The battle is coming to a conclusion without the truth coming to light!\nSource: crunchyroll",
