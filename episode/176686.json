  "description" : "The Unicorn Gundam reaches the wreckage of Laplace, and the La+ Program`s seal is broken. A speech given 96 years earlier by Ricardo Marcenas, the first prime minister of the Earth Federation government, begins playing back. Daguza realizes that the Gundam is more than just a killing machine to eradicate Zeon, and he tells Banagher that it incorporates something else that is controlled by a human heart. But then Frontal`s Sinanju launches an attack, escorted by Angelo and the rest of his guards, and Daguza is killed. Responding to Banagher`s anger, the Unicorn Gundam activates its NT-D system and changes into Destroy Mode, overpowering the Sinanju. However, Gilboa`s machine is shot down while acting as a shield. As the Unicorn Gundam falls toward Earth, Mineva witnesses it as a descending beam of light.\nSource: crunchyroll",
