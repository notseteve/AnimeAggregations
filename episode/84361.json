  "description" : "Manjoume aims to become a pro Duelist without any help from his older brothers, but all he receives are rejection notifications. Unable to simply stand by and watch Manjoume like this, Chronos takes him to Ed`s yacht. Once there, Chronos asks Ed to take Manjoume on as his apprentice. Manjoume does become Ed`s apprentice, but the daily life of the pro Duelist \"Ed\" is something he never could have imagined - phones that start ringing at 7 am, asking for interviews, long lines at meet-and-greets... And the most surprising thing, the blood-stained Duel training that Ed, so often called a genius, puts himself through.\nSource: crunchyroll",
