  "description" : "With Sena and Kuroneko constantly quarreling in the Games Development club, the club president decides they`ll have to write a game together and submit it to an online contest. Both girls have different concepts about the game`s theme, so they`ll both present them to the club whose members will then decide by majority vote whose concept will have to be implemented. And Kyousuke, with no programming skills thus acting as supervisor for the team, suggests to write an eroge - in order to have less competition and a better chance to win the contest.",
