  "description" : "Isla and Tsukasa are happy finally being a couple, and their colleagues cheer them on. They try to think of ways to make their time together meaningful, and they hear that the best way would be to do something surprising for their partner. Isla thinks of cooking lunch for Tsukasa, and she asks Michiru who is good at cooking to teach her, but she doesn`t know what sort of food Tsukasa likes. She asks him, but he says he just wants to have dinner with her, and Constance suggests that they try to cook together. They try to do so and make some messes doing it but they eventually produce something edible.",
