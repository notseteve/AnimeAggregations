Meanwhile, Karako attempts to infiltrate the Undertakers by disguising herself as a guard. As Toto appears before Ganta and Crow during their training session, Shiro, who gets drunk off of liquer sweets, appears before Genkaku, who also discovers Karako. Just as Ganta manages to produce a blood bullet that can break the sound barrier, Genkaku announces his capturing of Karako and Shiro. Despite being low on blood, Ganta rushes to where Genkaku, Karako and Shiro are, but is confronted by Nagi, who had been broken by Genkaku into a raging demon.",
