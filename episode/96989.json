  "description" : "It is another training day at the Ikaruga dojo, and Ibuki teaches the children while Washizu and Yoichi are paired. After getting beaten down Washizu washes his face at the pump with Torigaya, and decides to stop being so wishy-washy and declares his love for Ikaruga aloud. He meant Ibuki of course, but it is Ayame who hears him and misinterprets the declaration as being meant for her.\nAfterwards, Torigaya points out that Ayame is actually in love with Yoichi, and so they hatch a plan at the upcoming summer festival to pair Ibuki with Washizu, Ayame with Yoichi, while Torigaya accompanies Chihaya and Kagome. The plan goes awry when Torigaya mistakenly switches the pairs, leaving Ibuki with Yoichi and Ayame with Washizu.\nThe mysterious masked man who has been trying to kill Yoichi, Saginomiya Ukyou, and his sister Sakon, appear at the festival. Ukyou is seen to have an obsession with Ibuki, and Sakon hatches a plan to send Yoichi and the Ikarugas to a hot spring resort they control.",
