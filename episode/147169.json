  "description" : "Kaito and Akiho travel to the Tokyo Expo with their robot, where they discover they have to share a hotel room. As Kaito has nightmares that night, Akiho asks him to be a bit more open with his troubles. While preparing for the expo, Akiho becomes excited when she learns Misaki will be at the expo promoting the Exoskeleton robots. Kaito decides to meet up with her in person in order to confront her about Mizuka`s death, also talking about Kimijima, her meeting with the real Airi, who woke up in hospital the other day, and above all, her attitude towards Akiho. The Tokyo Expo soon begins with Akiho having a tough time impressing the crowd with the recent bias against Gunvarrel. At the same time, Sawada shows up with two agents searching the crowd as Exoskeleton Inc. begins showing off a new robot called Sumeragi which appears to be piloted by Misaki, but uses an external control system to the crowd. Later, despite Kaito`s warnings, Akiho goes to see Misaki, who is seen in a fully robotic suit. As Akiho tries to spur a reunion, Sawada appears and points a gun at Misaki, shocking Akiho and Kaito. Unperturbed, Misaki questions Akiho about the upcoming Tanegashima rocket launch before she flees as Sawada fires a shot in her direction.\nSource: Wikipedia",
