  "description" : "The Tower of Seizure falls on top of Nagare and Kaito faints after he tries to save him. According to Hikari, the Tower of Seizure converts anything of monetary value into data and absorbs it, so Nagare has been digitized and taken away, but is safe. Just as Kaito becomes relieved to hear that, a grim looking man by the name of Ryuuga Tennouji makes landfall where Isshin resides: Big Money Bay!\nSource: crunchyroll",
