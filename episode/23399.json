  "description" : "Lured to a cursed island, Black Jack is curious to see what sort of disease is worth a three million dollar fee. When he gets there, however, he discovers a century-old virus that causes the victim to suffer painful spasms as all the water drains from his body – leaving the victim dead from dehydration. But when a frightened mob decides to take matters into their own hands, it’ll take all of Black Jack’s skill to keep his patient alive.\nSource: tezukainenglish.com",
