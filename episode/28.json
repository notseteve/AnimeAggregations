  "description" : "The Arayashiki disagree about how Benzaiten could be retrieved. Kyouta and Asumi visit the shooting of the movie and observe Yoriko`s diva behavior; Abuto tells Kyouta that this lady is out of his league. Asumi tries to get closer to Kyouta but can`t stop the boy from suddenly running away. An Arayashiki woman attacks Kyouta with a hail of arrows; when Rumiko tries to protect him he instinctively makes use of his power. And at long last, Rumiko explains Kyouta`s role in the war to the confused boy.",
