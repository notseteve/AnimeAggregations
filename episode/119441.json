  "description" : "It is the Ert`Aria harvest festival, and to let Minette enjoy herself during the festivities, someone has to accompany her in case Aberdeen strikes again. The Tortilla sisters accompany her through most of the festival, and they see Agnes at her puppet show, Chelsea at the Knights` Cafe, and Carina at the cathedral looking over the artefacts. The Tortillas obtain an item from Leicester they need for the fireworks display that evening. Leicester brings Salsa back to Oasis to obtain an item from Nina, and is invited to join the rest of Oasis to watch the fireworks at the cathedral roof but instead opts to join Ritos to do the fireworks.",
