  "description" : "Don`t you know? There is an unspeakable story about a rich person beyond imagination. You probably know, right? It was by chance that this boy who was in debt was working as a butler for the heiress. His name is Hayate Ayasaki. In order to repay his debt, he worked hard, day and night, to be a first-class butler for Yagi Sanzenin. Hayate and Nagi entered themselves to participate in one of the events of the freestyle marathon at Shiroko Academy. However, Nagi says that 50 meters is a long distance run and seems to be her maximum threshold. Is Hayate able to guide Yagi safely to the finish line?\nSource: crunchyroll",
