  "description" : "When young Kotoko-chan, in the unintelligent F-Class, places her heart on Irie-kun, the top ranked student from A-Class, is it all for naught but pain? She finally, after many years, collects her courage and confesses, only to be torn down. Irie-kun even goes so far as to say he hates stupid girls (meaning her), he doesn`t even read her confession letter (which she poured her heart into so sweetly)! Will this one sided love continue in this adversity? And what`s this, she already has an extremely passionate admirer, Kin-kun? Yet poor Kotoko-chan`s day is not over. Tonight is the night she moves into her new house! Oh, the embarrassment though when a slight earthquake tiptoes through Tokyo, her house is the only one to have damage done. Oh, and how extensive it is! The house crumbles like a card pyramid. Now Kotoko-chan is without heart and home. Good thing her dad has a very hospitable friend that jumps at the opportunity to lend a hand to this family. But wait, his name is Irie-kun. It couldn`t possible be that... They are staying at Irie-kun`s house! What a twisted love chain it has become, and only the first episode!\nSource: theTVDB.com",
