  "description" : "As the Tokugawa clan`s messenger, Nobuyuki heads to Aizu to inform the Uesugi clan of their punishment following the battle of Sekigahara. He meets Kanetsugu Naoe, who refuses to accept the severe, and almost cruel, demands, but Nobuyuki refuses to budge too. On the other hand, while Yukimura escaped the death penalty, he was leading an empty life, without being able to find the \"meaning of his life\" that Nobuyuki had asked him to reconsider. But one night, things start to get noisy in his vicinity.\nSource: crunchyroll",
