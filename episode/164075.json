Later, after the girls make July to promise never to use his awakened power ever again, Hatoko helps Tomoyo with her studies. The next day, July makes a promise with Chifuyu to take her to the pool during summer break, with Chifuyu learning that she may have developed feelings for him, while another male classmate, Sagami Shizumu, approaches Sayumi with the prospect of getting together with July. Meanwhile, Hatoko reveals to Tomoyo that she is in love with July, asking if she also feels the same. \nSource: Wikipedia",
