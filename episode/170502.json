  "description" : "Kimihito seems to be going on a date with Ms. Smith, much to the consternation of all the girls. They follow them around, with Suu providing disguises for each of them, but they wind up in compromising situations as they do this. It turns out that they were on a plan to smoke out the sender of threatening letters that Kimihito has received, saying that if he marries someone he will die.\nThe date with Ms. Smith failed to smoke out the perpetrator, so they arrange a date with Miia, with Mero tagging along. They go to a public aquarium where Mero is treated like a celebrity, and the attention Kimihito seems to be giving her irritates Miia enough that she eventually walks out on him. A reptilian monster tries to console her and eventually declares that as a fellow reptile he is more appropriate to marry her than Kimihito, saying he is Draco the Dragonewt. Kimihito runs to save Miia before Draco can do more, and reveals that Draco is actually female. MON has been observing them, and they arrest Draco, but she was not the one who was sending the threatening letters.",
