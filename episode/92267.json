  "description" : "Rima obtains tickets for two to a comedy show. As Amu and Rima are walking, they see a girl, Miyako, practicing her comedy act. Rima, unsatisfied, goes over and starts to train Miyako. After seeing her do \"Bala-Balance\" perfectly via Character Change, she praises Rima as the \"Goddess of Comedy\" and promises to follow her. While they are backstage, the main man of the comedy act comes in and believes that her comedy act is not good, so he shows her how it should be done. When she is on stage, the main man taunts her, and she runs off. Due to all this, an X Egg is born from her and hatches. Amu and Rima purify the X Character and go back on stage, where the main man is failing. Miyako saves his comedy act, and he, too, calls Rima the \"Goddess of Comedy.\" The episode ends with them all running and laughing hysterically, to Amu`s shock.\nSource: crunchyroll",
