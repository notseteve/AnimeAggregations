  "description" : "Instead of trying to get Team Hiragi back for their production, Hoshitani, Ageha, and Kitahara ask the Kao Council to join them in performing in Opening Ceremony. Sadly, however, their bold request is completely rejected. Hoshitani and the others refuse to give up and come up with a crazy gamble to try and break the deadlock. Meanwhile, Irinatsu has been tasked with composing the music for Opening Ceremony, but has been unable to find any inspiration and the song remains unfinished. Feeling the pressure from Fuyusawa, Irinatsu finds a distraction in Hoshitani and the others.\nSource: crunchyroll",
