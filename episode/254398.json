  "description" : "Kosuke enjoyed his date with his beloved Aika. They did things like shop for clothes and watch a movie. In the midst of his fun, Kosuke watched Kanade, her date, and a lot of other couples up close. He ends up being made aware he was the only one playing with dolls, and the feeling makes him scream and cry.\nMeanwhile, Kanade is still in shock from the words Shikijou said to her on their date: \"You didn`t seem normal.\" Seeing this, Yukimura asks Kanade for the definition of \"normal,\" and declares that living with an obsession about being \"normal\" is a truly stupid way to live.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
