  "description" : "While Renji hurries to get Rukia out of harm`s way, Ichigo stays behind to hold off Byakuya Kuchiki. Though Rukia was wrong about Ichigo`s ability to save her from execution, she does not believe that he can survive another battle with her brother. In an attempt to distract Soi Fon, Yoruichi comes to Ichigo`s aid and battles her. At the same time, Captain Ukitake and Captain Kyoraku are in hot water as Head Captain Yamamoto takes the punishment of his two most trusted captains into his own hands for their assisting in the rescue of Rukia.\nSource: crunchyroll",
