  "description" : "Kūgen notices that Tōru also has the same scar that Miyako once had. This spurs Kūgen to perform a taboo ritual that will allow the bridge between the mortal and the spirit realm to be opened. During the dance-like ritual, Ebisu arrives and commands Kūgen to discontinue the rite, otherwise he will have to enforce the necessary punishment. Kūgen attempts to fight Ebisu, but he threatens to harm the brothers. Kūgen surrenders and allows her hair to be cut off in return for forgiveness. Afterwards, Tōru meets his mother as a spirit for the first time, however she cannot be seen by Noboru. Miyako remarks that she and Tōru are alike before she departs for the afterlife. Back in his convenience store, Ebisu is delighted that he can now sell bracelets created from Kūgen`s hair.\nSource: crunchyroll",
