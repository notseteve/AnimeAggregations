But the amount of saliva they collected was insufficient and so retesting is required. They head to the biological sciences` Regulation of Biological Systems Department to meet with a specialist in saliva testing. There, they find an alluring woman dressed like a traditional courtesan wearing a lab coat, Suiu, and her sweetheart, Chris. When Yukimura asks Suiu and Chris to help with their experiment to \"give proof of love,\" Chris and Suiu flaunt their overwhelming aura of love.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
