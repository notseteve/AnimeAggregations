  "description" : "Upon the start of a new term, North High School is preparing for the annual school Culture Festival. Displeased with the class decision on a questionnaire, Haruhi tells Kyon that the SOS Brigade will do something more interesting. Influenced by a bad film the previous night, Haruhi commits the Brigade for a short independent film with Mikuru and Itsuki as the protagonists, Yuki as the villain, and Kyon doing `menial tasks` including the filming. Kyon and Mikuru accompany Haruhi as she negotiates shop owners for materials, such as an expensive camcorder and airsoft guns for free upon willingness to sponsor the film.",
