  "description" : "Yukito and Toya got cast as the main characters in a film for the high school`s fair! When Sakura stumbled into one of their scenes, Nakuru, the director, asked her to be in the movie too! I came along to the filming so that I could shoot some behind-the-scenes footage fo my own and capture Sakura`s debut on the silver screen. Yukito ended up getting super tired and fell off a balcony during a scene! It turned out that it was because Yue was almost out of energy, so Toya gave Yue his own magic power to keep Yue and Yukito from disappearing.\nSource: crunchyroll",
