Zo Zo needs to mail a card for Isamu’s Grandma’s birthday, but Zombie Hunter Joe is determined that the line between humanity and zombies must be drawn at the post office. Zo Zo miraculously saves the day after Isamu accidentally knocks a precious family spit vase into the air. Isamu and Zo Zo “buddy-up” with Zombie Rich Girl to take advantage of her VIP status at a food truck festival, but in order to do that they’ll have to keep up with her bottomless stomach and extreme tastes.\nSource: crunchyroll",
