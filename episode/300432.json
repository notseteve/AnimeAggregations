  "description" : "Historia decides their people must be told the truth about the Titans, which had been kept secret for 100 years; that the breaching of Wall Maria five years ago was the beginning of a planned invasion by the state of Marley to steal their resources; and that the King a century ago had erased all of their memories to make them think humanity was wiped out and maintain peace rather than fight Marley. At a ceremony to honor their fallen comrades, Historia presents the nine surviving Scouts with medals. Eren touches her hand and is flooded by memories of his father confronting the Fritz royal family, indicating a connection through Titan blood. It takes one year to eradicate all Titans inside Wall Maria; finally, the refugees return to their hometowns and the Scouts resume expeditions outside the Walls. One day, they go far enough that they arrive at the Wall Eren recognizes as where Grisha became a Titan, and for the first time, everyone sees the ocean. Though the rest joyfully play, Eren is somber, realizing that they only found more enemies instead of freedom. He asks everyone if they would be finally be free if they kill their enemies on the other side of the sea.",
