  "description" : "After Ichika enjoys her first Japanese festival, Remon pops out of nowhere to challenge everyone to a test of courage at a dark shrine. During the test Rinon appears to Ichika, telling that an emergency beacon has been activated. True enough, a League lifeboat (a rescue drone) comes to rescue her (it`s more of taking her by force), but Ichika says she has still a lot to do. Then again, when Kaito hears Ichika scream, he rushed to where she is, abandoning his partner Kanna. Even with the help of Rinna, one of Ichika`s machines, Kaito dies rescuing \"the one he loves.\" Ichika, however, manages to reverse Kaito`s death. Kaito awakens and sees himself with Ichika inside a ball of light, and mysteriously returning to the same spot. Everyone catches up to the two and sees Ichika incessantly apologizing in front of Kaito.\nSource: Wiki",
