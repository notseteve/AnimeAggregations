  "description" : "Christmas may be near at hand, but it`s not going to be a happy holiday for the crew of the Nadesico. The UEAF doesn`t want such a powerful warship under the command of civilians and is giving the crew a choice: join the military or get off the ship. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Erina offers Akito a job assisting in her organic boson jumping research. But is being a her pawn really worth the risk, or should he just forget about the offer and spend a quiet holiday with Megumi?\nSource: crunchyroll",
