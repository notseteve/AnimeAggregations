  "description" : "A ritual ceremony is carried out, which is the most important duty of a Youmeishi. As the ritual is solemnly progressing, members of the Shito family appear and bring their suspicions to Tanmoku Ki. Upon hearing all this, Ki turns the blade of the Rakugetsu sword on Keika. Will Ki choose the alliance of his family with the Shito family over Keika? After the ceremony, life at the Tanmoku mansion returns to normal. Troubled by the very \"my pace\" attitude with which Ki lives his life, Keika learns that there is more to the stone-faced young man than meets the eye.\nSource: crunchyroll",
