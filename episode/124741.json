  "description" : "A mysterious man offers Takeru the drug Line, which he takes. After waking and finding neither Rin nor Akira with him, Keisuke runs off to look for them while Akira is attacked and injured by a rain influenced group, only escaping (with a tag) when the leader of the group goes insane and collapses when he licks Akira`s blood. Shiki meets with Arbitro, and the former gives the latter a black case full what appears to be enhanced Line . After Motomi saves Akira (who was wondering if he did that to the leader of the group) the trouble of an encounter with the Executioners, the two decide to go to the hotel, where they meet up with Rin and Keisuke. Akira, irritated by the way Keisuke always makes light of the situation and puts himself down, yells at Keisuke who, feeling useless, runs away.",
