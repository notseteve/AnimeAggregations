  "description" : "Pheles and Johan`s child, Justus, is entrusted to Wilhelmina, while a large group of Flame Haze is assembled at the Heavenly palace to depart to Xanadu with them. Lamis also sets for the Denizens` new world leaving to Yuji some Power of Existence he assembled and a restricted spell \"Grammatica\", whose properties he lets Yuji find out for himself. Only Shana, Yuji, Sydonay, Margery and Kazumi stay behind when the spell on Misaki City is lifted and the city starts moving again. Yuji reveals to the others that there is no duplicate of Misaki City in Xanadu, as he was unable to recreate it due to the role the city played in Xanadu`s creation. Yuji asks Shana for Yukari Hirai`s torch so he can restore her to existence. Shana refuses to agree with Yuji`s intentions to leave her behind in astonishment and starts fighting him, while Margery goes full force against Sydonay. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana`s feelings and Sydonay is killed, fulfilling his wish to rejoin Hecate in spirit. When Yuji and Shana kiss, the spell left by Lamis activates and Yuji becomes a real existence, no longer a Torch. Life returns to normal at Misaki City, including Yukari Hirai being restored, and Kantaro and Chigusa`s child (Miyu Sakai) is born. Yuji and Shana depart for Xanadu together.\nSource: Wiki",
