  "description" : "Edward and Alphonse hear of a blind alchemist named Judeau who had supposedly performed a successful human transmutation. Meeting up with him, Jude reveals to Edward that a young girl named Rosalie Harbinger was resurrected through alchemy, with his eyes paid for in equivalent exchange. However, the madame refuses to teach Edward about the techniques used. Rosalie leads Alphonse to a room with a little girl`s shriveled corpse inside. She reveals this as the result of the real Rosalie`s transmutation, while she herself is a girl named Amy, who was adopted due to her similar appearance to Rosalie. As Edward arrives on the scene, the madame tells him that her late husband kept the truth about the transmutation failure from Judeau, who truly wanted to resurrect Rosalie. The Elric brothers then leave carrying this knowledge with them as well.",
