  "description" : "Iri and Saber are driving to Einzbern Castle when they encounter Caster. Caster believes Saber is Jeanne d`Arc, but Saber tells him he is mistaken and drives him away. Returning to his lair, Caster is convinced \"Jeanne\" has lost her memories. At his hotel, Kayneth scolds Lancer for failing to kill Saber. Lancer is defended by Sola-Ui Nuada-Re Sophia-Ri, Kayneth`s fiancee, who is maintaining Lancer`s existence by supplying him with mana and has fallen for him due to his magic love spot. When the hotel`s occupants are ordered to evacuate, Kayneth realizes Saber`s Master has come for them. After making sure all civilians have evacuated, Kiritsugu and Maiya blow up the hotel using explosives. Maiya is found by Kirei, but escapes thanks to Kiritsugu`s smoke bomb. When the Assassins inform Kirei, Risei and Tokiomi that Caster and Uryū have been kidnapping and sacrificing children, Risei is disgusted by their pointless murders and their jeopardising the war`s secrecy. In a meeting between Archer and Kirei, the former convinces the latter to spy on the other Masters and find out what drives them in order to discover his own desires",
