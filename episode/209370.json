  "description" : "As Doc is enjoying another peaceful afternoon drinking coffee at Miss Melba`s café, he`s suddenly pulled underground through a manhole by a tentacled beast. This monster of the underground water system is know as the Devil Fish Kraken, and it just happens to love coffee, so it was attracted to Doc`s coffee-saturated scent. Seth and Melie head underground to save him, but Seth`s attacks have no effect on the beast`s soft body.\nSource: crunchyroll",
