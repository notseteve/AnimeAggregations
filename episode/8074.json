  "description" : "After losing the fight with Grumblemon, Takuya, Koji & Tommy fell into a world of living toys, where they all fought with each other! Then an overgrown teddy bear (WaruMonzaemon), working for the ShadowToyAgumon, captured Tommy. Takuya & Koji Spirit Evolved and made quick work of the bad toys but when they got to Tommy, he was playing with his captor (Monzaemon). At least they got a free ride to the Forest Kingdom and now all they need to do is find the rest of the gang!\nSource: crunchyroll",
