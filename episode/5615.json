  "description" : "My name is Jester. I am a master swordsman and I love adventure. An old fortune-telling woman tells me that the King wants to kill me. I steal her purse and open it. There is only a stone inside. It is not an ordinary stone though. A giant spirit named Jin comes out of the stone. He transforms me into a young lady before I can even ask why. I am captured and thrown into a jail in a castle. \"What is going on?\" \nSource: enoki-films.co.jp",
