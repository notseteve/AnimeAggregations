  "description" : "Misha confesses the shocking truth that, \"At midnight on my 15th birthday, I`m going to disappear.\" Misha was never supposed to exist in this world in the first place, but due to Ivis Necron`s magic, she was living a transient life. She had resigned to her fate that she will only live for 15 years, but Anos tells her, \"There are two things that I do not understand. Regret and saying that something is impossible.\" The misfit crushes the tragedy and unjust fate that binds the two sisters.\nSource: crunchyroll",
