  "description" : "Tsuna cannot swim, and doesn`t want to look bad in front of Kyoko. Fortunately Yamamoto proposes to help him practice at the public pool, but offers overly abstract advice. Reborn calls over Haru and Gokudera, but they`re not much help either. Soon a competition to see who can teach Tsuna how to swim begins! Will he learn how to swim or drown first?\nSource: crunchyroll",
