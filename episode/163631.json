  "description" : "Hatoko is invited to July`s house to make dinner for him and his sister, but gets downhearted when July decides to stay at school to talk with Tomoyo about her writing. Hatoko gets angry at July when he refuses to tell him what he talked about with Tomoyo and snaps at him, going on a rant about how she just can`t understand his chuunibyou behavior before running off. As July goes off in search for Hatoko, he worries that he might have been putting stress on her the entire time, but Tomoyo slaps some sense into him and helps him search. Meanwhile, Hatoko comes across another Chuunibyou, who teaches her not to worry about not being able to understand chuunibyou, before using his own power to knock Hatoko unconscious. With July having no luck in finding Hatoko, Sayumi decides to bring her Root of Origin to the next stage in order to find her. \nSource: Wikipedia",
