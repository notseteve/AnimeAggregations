  "description" : "Dr. Hanamaru has developed radioactive iodine in order to save coral on the verge of extinction. The coral should be able to come back to life if radioactive iodine is released in its vicinity. In the midst of his experiment, Dr. Hanamaru and Akira are caught in a violent storm, and are cast up on the shore of a coral island. The storm has actually been caused by Hans Engel. In order to deprive Akira of his magnet pencil, Hans Engel uses a fake version of the radioactive iodine developed by Dr. Hanamaru, and causes mutation among the creatures on the bottom of the sea. Enormously large lobsters, crabs, and sharks attack Akira and his party. Akira turns into Big X and takes on Hans.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
