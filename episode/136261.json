  "description" : "The Genso Siblings (Jacque, Doudou, and Janet) attack Ornières to kill Saito, so a battle between them and Saito and co. breaks out. As the battle goes on, a trio of elves sneaks in to capture Tifa, but Saito confronts them. The fourth sibling, Damian, appears and uses alchemy to cease the fighting, and one of the elves uses that magic with his own to capture both Tifa and Saito. The two awaken in a desert oasis and meet their captor, a female elf named Luctiana. At Tristain, Henrietta tells Louise they cannot send a rescue party since Romalia is handling the situation, but Louise resolves to save Saito anyway. Luctiana tells Saito and Tifa she is holding them to study human culture, and also reveals the reason why they were kidnapped was because Tifa is a void mage, a power which elves fear, and because Saito is Gandlafr. As Louise prepares to leave she is joined by Siesta and Tabitha, who are then joined by the rest of their friends on the Ostland. Saito and Tifa try to escape, but are unable to since a magic binds them to the area. Saito assure Tifa that they will escape, and the two decide to go for a swim in the oasis, where Saito discovers a submerged fighter jet.\nSource: Wiki",
