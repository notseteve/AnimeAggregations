Reborn says he doesn`t know what order the Arcobaleno will appear. Tsuna suggests they should go to school and do as they would usually do. However, during recess they are suddenly attacked on the roof! It is a baby with goggles. It’s Lal Mirch. Lal says that she is the observer to the Arcobaleno Trials.
