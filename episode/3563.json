  "description" : "Our class took a trip to a ski resort, Eriol is a really good skier! The first night, Naoko wanted to tell scary stories, and Eriol had one about a Snow Spirit! Sakura seemed a little scared that night... Since Sakura learned how to ski really quickly, the next day she decided to head up to a harder hill with Eriol. I didn`t go up because I wanted to film her coming down for \"Sakura Dances on the Silvery White Mountain,\" but it started snowing pretty hard and everyone had to go inside.

Sakura tried to stop it using the time and Firey cards, but it was too much power and she ended up passing out...\nSource: crunchyroll",
