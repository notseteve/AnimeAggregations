  "description" : "After a fierce but futile battle, the satellite cannon hidden inside the moon has unleashed a devastating beam. Its effects reach beyond the planet Eldora, extending to all of GBN and even the real world where Hiroto and the others live. It appears that their previous battles may not have been all a game, but actual events instead. Hiroto is completely bewildered by this unimaginable development. But he is no longer alone. It is now inevitable that the Build Divers must meet in real life.\nSource: crunchyroll",
