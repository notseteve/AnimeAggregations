  "description" : "Communication has been cut off between Jun and the scam artist claiming to be his younger self, the more positive version of himself who chose to wind the turn key. University-aged Jun finds himself alone with all the doll parts he has completed, perplexed as to how to proceed now that the publication has gone out of print in mid-run. He finds his unhappy and disatisfying young life has been turned upside-down by the unexpected desire to create something, for the first time in a very long time. Once upon a time, a very long time ago, a supportive teacher accidentally made his life into a living hell, because other children can be very jealous and inexplicably cruel. His younger, and naively optimistic, self finally re-establishes contact and sets university-aged Jun back on the path to completing Rozen Maiden doll No.5, \"Shinku,\" but there is yet another trial in store.\nSource: crunchyroll",
