  "description" : "Together with the ECOAS special forces group, the Nahel Argama of the Earth Federation Forces` Londo Bell unit begins an operation to recapture Banagher and the Unicorn Gundam. The resource satellite Palau, stronghold of the Neo Zeon remnants known as the Sleeves, becomes the newest battlefield. Amid the chaos Banagher is reunited with Mineva, who tells him that she is going to Earth to seek the help of Riddhe`s father. Meanwhile, Frontal attempts to use the Cyber-Newtype Marida to trigger the Unicorn Gundam`s NT-D (Newtype Destroyer) system, which is the key to Laplace`s Box. As Banagher fights against Marida and her Kshatriya, he learns of her past history and the pain within her heart, thanks to the resonance between fellow Newtypes.\nSource: crunchyroll",
