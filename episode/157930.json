  "description" : "Seido, Inashiro Vocational, and Shuhoku are having a three-way round-robin. Game two of the round-robin is Inashiro vs Shuhoku, and the ace of Inashiro, Mei Narumiya, is pitching this game. He`s the one who shut out Seido`s batters at the last summer tournament semi-final. To make matters worse, Narumiya shows off a new weapon he didn`t have last year. The pitch lights a fire under Seido`s ace, Tanba. He too has a new weapon he`s been working on.\nSource: crunchyroll",
