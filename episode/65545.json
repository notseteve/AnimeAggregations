  "description" : "Ichigo and Kariya`s final clash begins on Sokyoku hill. Ichigo realizes that Kariya`s fighting style consists of counterattacks that rely on his incredible ability to recover. He uses Tensa Zangetsu`s speed to attack fiercely so that Kariya doesn`t have time to make a counterattack. Kariya is cornered and forced to release Messer`s hidden power in order to fight Ichigo. Messer can create electricity by causing friction in the air, and Ichigo is tossed about by the lightning that Messer produces. Meanwhile, the entire Seireitei is working to seal away all Jokai Crests on the orders of  the Head Captain.\nSource: crunchyroll",
