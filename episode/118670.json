  "description" : "In the city of Ert`Aria lives the young inventor Leicester Maycraft. He is part of a small adventuring clan called Oasis led by Carina Verritti, the daughter of the Archduke who rules over the city. Later that evening there is to be a regular meteor shower that comes once every seven years, and the clan is preparing a party. They meet a young puppeteer named Agnes Boulange who makes an impressive show of her magical automata puppets in the square. They also meet a young knight named Chelsea Arcot and the sisters Ritos and Salsa who run the Tortilla shop in front of their clan hall.\nThe clan holds their little party at the roof of the city`s cathedral, and a great meteor comes their way. It is not a physical meteor, but a cluster of Ale, the magical energy used in that world. It strikes a tower near where they are, and Leicester goes to investigate. In the tower finds a bed where what appears to be a young girl is lying down. When the others reach him, the girl awakens, and calls Leicester `Papa`.",
