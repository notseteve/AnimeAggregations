  "description" : "The time is Sengoku.\nJapan is fractured into many independent nations entangled in ceaseless war. At the center lies Ashina, a land of sacred earth and ancient mystery. Two decades after Sword Saint Isshin Ashina reclaimed the region in a brutal coup, a new threat emerges from within: The Interior Ministry. Desperate to protect his homeland, Isshin`s grandson Gen`ichirou turns to forbidden powers. The only hope lies in a kidnapped boy — the Divine Heir — and his silent protector: a loyal shinobi known only as Sekiro.\nThis is the story of a lord and his retainer — and their quest to restore balance to a nation on the edge.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
