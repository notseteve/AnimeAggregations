  "description" : "* Based on a love comedy manga by http://anidb.net/cr9553 [Narumi Naru].\nWatari Naoto has had his share of struggles: his parents died two years ago, and now he and his sister live at his aunt`s house. There, his desire to protect his sister earned him notoriety as \"the guy with the sister complex\"—which never mattered to him, as his sister always came first. But when Satsuki, a childhood friend-turned-enemy(?), becomes his school mate, Naoto`s ordinary life is thrown into chaos ... and Satsuki may just be the beginning.\nSource: Kodansha",
