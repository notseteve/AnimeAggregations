As the mine for Orgonium, a new energy resource, this city is the most noticed in the world right now, and here special cases caused by demons called \"D Hazards\" has been occurring frequently.\nOnly a handful of people know about the existence of D Hazards. They are handled by PMCs (Private Military Companies). http://anidb.net/ch122938 [Shuu] is a young man living in Bayron City who runs such a company, but his company is tiny. On top of that, he cherry-picks his jobs, so he is always in a bind for money. His life, both publicly and privately, is being supported by the beautiful high school girl http://anidb.net/ch122936 [Kisara] who attends a school in Bayron City. And there is one more person that keeps him on her mind: http://anidb.net/ch122937 [Ayano], an employee of a major PMC that Shuu used to work for and Shuu`s ex-girlfriend. Kisara finds her unpleasant.\nAt the root of Kisara`s strong attachment to Shuu is a contract signed between them. Her true identity is a demon. Kisara supports Shuu`s lifestyle, and even assists his demon extermination based on their contract. The price is a dangerously sweet kiss. Their uncertain bond teeters between love and contract. Where is their destiny headed...?\nSource: Official Website",

Saved by Ayano and Sharon, Shu helplessly evacuates from the fight when he sees the person he`s been looking for—his younger sister, Kanna. Then, humanity`s desperate resistance, backed by the focused efforts of Bayron City, proves futile as the extent of the large-scale disasters caused by Kanna, now certified as an S-Class demon, expand. Kisara collapsed due to her injuries and lost consciousness as her vitals disappeared. Unable to move, Shu just stares at her. And as if responding to his heart, Kisara gently awakens.\nSource: crunchyroll",
