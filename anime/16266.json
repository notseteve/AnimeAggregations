There, http://anidb.net/ch117824 [Teruto]`s battle was all about rescuing the trapped http://anidb.net/ch117820 [Kikka] from her role as the main CPU...\nTime passed, and it`s three years later...\nNeo Kyoto is now a city in ruins, looking nothing like it did before. The people are being rounded up by the King`s servants, known as KUGE, and deposited into \"Barrels\" to steal their magical power. All in order to keep the King going...\nAnd now a girl appears, with the KUGE in pursuit. She`s the former King, Kurabe Kikka. Although she was once known as the most powerful King in Neo Kyoto`s history, even Kikka is helpless against the KUGE, and is constantly on the run from them. After all, Kikka has no Build-Divide deck in hand. Day after day, she continues to flee with no respite, consumed by all kinds of regrets. Now that she`s on the brink of despair, who should reach out a helping hand to her but...?\nIn the ruins of Neo Kyoto, the two girls take each other by the hand. And now, their battle is about to begin...the one that will lead them to the http://anidb.net/ch117824 [person] that they both cherish.\nSource: Official website",
