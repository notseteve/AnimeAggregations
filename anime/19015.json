  "description" : "Yakou Shizuka, a quiet and bashful woman, works at a detective agency. Her boss Tounome, who owns the company, is the gentlemanly type, kind and dapper, though he has an extra talent—he`s invisible! His special ability is perfect for detective work, but he quickly comes to find it doesn`t work on Yakou, who is blind and always knows if he`s near. Charmed, Tounome is determined to get her to date him and isn`t against using his many skills. Yakou`s quirky coworkers, a contrarian human man and a sisterly beastwoman, kindly watch over her as she stumbles and blushes through the uncharted waters of office romance.\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
