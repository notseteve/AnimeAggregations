Li Haobai, a young man from Shu, has his heart set on the journey to join the army at Hangu Pass with his young partner Hu Jian in order to realize his ambition; in the chaotic world, demons emerge. In the city of Chengdu, the old Taoist Free Spirit goes around subduing demons and eliminating them; while far away in Chang`an, the unsuspecting old Taoist Xun Guosi deceives the Emperor into cultivating immortality and uses his minions to capture \"dragon beasts\" indiscriminately \" to cultivate an immortal elixir. Li Haobai, by chance, fuses with the \"Lixi pearl\" inside the dragon beast and becomes the target of all the people. Not only does Xun Guo Shi`s men want to capture Li Haobai, but also people from all walks of life in the Jianghu River want to get the Lixi pearl to cultivate immortality. Li Haobai is rescued by a man who is passing by to remove the demons. He is warned that if he does not take out the Lixi pearl and return it to the Dragon Veins, Li Haobai will die within 30 days and the world will suffer a catastrophe due to the turbulence of the Dragon Veins. On their way to join the army at Hangu Pass, they meet a wandering girl from the West, Ahimu. During the journey, the four escape from the pursuit of Xun Guo Shi`s men several times, and during the journey, Li Xiao Bai slowly merges with Li Hao Bai, who inadvertently transforms into a \"black dragon\". During the journey, a white dragon, symbolizing \"yang\", suddenly appears and pesters Li Haobai all the way. The mysterious white dragon leads the boy to leave Li Haobai and track down the white dragon to discover its secret. When the Lixi pearl is discovered, the news spreads around the world and Li Haobai, who is carrying the Lixi pearl, is hunted by strange people in the jungle.\nsource: bgm.tv/DeepL.com",
