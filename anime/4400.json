  "description" : "* Stop motion animation by http://anidb.net/cr702 [Kawamoto Kihachirou], rare for him in that it uses drawings rather than puppets.\nAfter his mother suddenly disappears and he is fired from his job for daring to confront the boss about unfair wages, a man begins to live a solitary life. Unable to relieve the suffering of his ex-co-workers, he scribbles down encouraging words to hand out to them as they leave for the day. As the harshest winter the town has ever known sets in, all hope for survival seems lost, but amidst the snow, ice and suffering, one man awakens to his true calling as a poet.\nSource: Anime-Planet",
