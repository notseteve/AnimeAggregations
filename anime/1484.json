Reasoning being the Nazi themed content which http://anidb.net/cr40923 [Pioneer Entertainment (USA)] wanted to release only after the viewers made themselves familiar with the franchise. There are other discrepancies in the footage itself due to copyright infringement issues. The episodes 145 and 155 (both by http://anidb.net/cr40 [Hayao Miyazaki]) have been released previously on VHS by Streamline Pictures (US) as \"Tales of the Wolf\" and \"Greatest Capers\" (compilation tape)",
