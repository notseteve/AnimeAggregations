The next morning he is attacked by another Kämpfer named Akane Mishima wielding a sidearm. Natsuru protects his friend Kaede Sakura from Akane`s attack, before saving Akane from a falling lamppost. Natsuru is approached the following day by a shy girl who reveals herself to be Akane, who is completely different in appearance and personality when in Kämpfer form. Akane tells Natsuru as much as she knows about the Kämpfer, even helping him when he transforms. Apparently, they are allies due to their bracelets being the same color, blue, hence they become known as Blue Kämpfer and that their enemies are the Red Kämpfer, who have red bracelets, accordingly. At the end of the day, Kaede tells Natsuru that she has fallen for his Kämpfer form. The next day, when he goes to Akane for advice, they are attacked by another hidden Kämpfer while in the school library. When Kaede suddenly appears in the wreckage, Akane assumes she is the enemy and shoots her gun at her. \nSource: TBS (translated)",

      "description" : "Natsuru finds himself sitting next to Kaede outside the hotel, who hypnotizes him into making Shizuku his. Kaede then disappears when Natsuru, who can`t remember anything after leaving the room, is found and confronted by Akane, Shizuku and Mikoto in their respective Kämpfer forms. They return to the hotel where they are greeted by Kaede who doesn`t appear to recall seeing the fireworks with Natsuru either. Afterwards, they all go (with Natsuru in female form) to the women`s baths, where Natsuru`s hypnotism kicks in and he then brings Shizuku back to the room to make a move on her, but he gets knocked out when he let slip that Kaede told him to do it. It is also revealed in a scene that Kaede appears to be in command of the White Kämpfer. The next day, Kaede whispers something in Shizuku`s ear, confirming her suspicions. \nSource: TBS (translated)",

      "description" : "Shizuku invites Natsuru over to her house to tell her about Kaede, getting Kaede`s Burnt To Death Lion to spill the beans about the Kämpfer system. She recalls that her close friend Tamiko was killed in a Kämpfer battle and has since sworn vengeance against whoever responsible for the establishment of Kämpfer combat. When Natsuru confronts Kaede about this, he once again falls under Kaede`s hypnotism. With Natsuru under her control, Kaede and the White Kämpfer trap and capture Shizuku, Akane and Mikoto. When the three of them wake up later chained together, Kaede tries to get Natsuru to finish them herself, but he spots a keychain he previously bought for Shizuku and snaps out of it, declaring that he will not betray his friends despite his love for Kaede. This declaration encourages Shizuku, Akane, and Mikoto to fight with renewed resolve, enabling them to break free and allowing them to easily defeat the White Kämpfer. Kaede tries enticing Natsuru once again, but he transforms back into normal form, putting himself out of the fight (and out of Kaede`s disposal) as well as forcing Kaede and the White Kämpfer into retreat. With the battle over, Shizuku, Akane and Mikoto turn their attention to Natsuru, initially jumping him for trying to make out with Kaede in front of them before competing against each other to see who can appeal to Natsuru best with their \"qualities\" (to the point of kissing him, grabbing his hands and forcing him to touch sensitive areas, and rubbing their breasts onto him). \nSource: TBS (translated)",

      "description" : "Natsuru wakes up on Christmas Eve morning to find out that he and his messenger, Disemboweled Tiger, have swapped bodies! Disemboweled Tiger decides to head on outside to enjoy this occasion and sees Natsuru`s friends Mikoto, Shizuku, and Akane on the streets only to notice that they`ve also been body swapped with their respective messengers, namely Strangled Stray Dog, Electrocuted Wildcat and Black Seppuku Rabbit, as well. The messengers have fun with their new bodies until they are caught sneaking out on a food bill and are forced to perform in a show. Kaede then encounters them and takes them to an amusement park, where they begin to get aroused and play erotic games with her. Kaede goes to a church to confess the sin of committing indecent acts with multiple girls all at once, but she just ends up being punished by the student council (who also happen to be working there). The messengers come to save her, but end up fighting each other instead when they discover (to their delight) that they can feel pain. After saying their goodbyes to Kaede, they ride off on a sleigh, the whole thing being a bizarre Christmas story. \nSource: TBS (translated)",
