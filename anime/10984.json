He does not deny it, but denies that he is doing so because his demon weapon is manipulating him into it. She sees Yuuichirou who has somewhat recovered from his ordeal and is researching ways to turn a vampire back into a human for Mikaela`s sake.\nHe is called by the Hiiragis, the commanders of the demon army, and is warned by Mitsuba who was interviewed ahead of them of how ruthless and paranoid they are. He is also met by Guren who admonishes him to remember where his loyalties lie. He is tested by Hiiragi Kureto for his loyalty, and is interrogated, with Shihou and Yoichi being tortured in an adjoining room to ensure his honesty. Kureto tells him about the significance of his family name, Hyakuya, which was the name of the orphanage where he lived, and how it was before the vampire war the name of a group of powerful magicians who conducted human experiments on the children in their orphanages, so it is highly probable that Yuuichiro and Mikaela were the subject of such human experiments.\nAfter the interrogation Yuuichiro confronts Guren about Kureto`s revelations, and he does not deny it. Yuuichiro is not resentful, as whatever the reasons Guren had, if he had not saved him, he would be dead anyway.",

A group of Horsemen approach them and Yoichi manages to make his demon weapon manifest and destroys them, as he managed to figure out how to do so on his own.\nYuuichirou performs the process first, and is restrained by the others as he allows his weapon to take his blood. He enters a trance as he comes into contact with his demon Ashuramaru. He is made to remember how his parents tried to kill him, calling him a dangerous demon known as the \"Seraph of the End\", and how he had caused the deaths of everyone because he tried to run. His resolve proves stronger than this and he manages to overcome Ashuramaru.\nIt is then Shihou`s turn and in the same way he made to confront his own demon, Kiseki-ou. He is made to remember how he had prevented a group of children he had been with from killing her because he refused to do so himself, and how afterwards he had been tempted to abandon her, but he also proves stronger than this and gets Kiseki-ou to submit.\nMeanwhile, in the vampire world Krul Tepes is in a meeting with the vampire high council. Ferid enters with Mikaela behind him, and he shows them how the humans have somehow made the Seraph of the End into a weapon, though Krul had supposedly destroyed all of the experimental subjects with the Hyakuya sect. This causes many questions to be raised about her handling of the situation. Ferid blackmails her in this way, reminding her that if she acts against him, the fact that she is keeping Mikaela around and that he has permitted Yuuichirou to escape will come to light.",

They meet to try to determine whether Guren is really on their side or not, since it seems he is not only manipulating Yuuichirou but the entire squad for his own purposes. Yuuichirou is told of what had happened during the battle for the first time, how he had gone berserk and nearly killed Shinoa. He decides that he wants to continue to stick with Guren as he told them all that they were family and that he promised him that he would find a way to save Mikaela.\nMeanwhile, Guren and Hiiragi Kureto meet, and the two men have a discussion about the future plans. Kureto tells him that he plans to restore the world, after destroying all the vampires in Japan he will subjugate all the other human organisations remaining and place the entire world under his command. He orders Guren to bring a hundred of his Moon Demon Company to Nagoya, and defeat the ten vampire nobles who have established a base there.\nIn the vampire world Mikaela`s craving for blood grows so intense that he takes blood directly from Krul`s neck. She warns him that soon enough her blood alone will not be enough to satisfy him. He questions her motives in letting him and Yuuichiro live, and she whispers to him the reason why she needs the Seraph of the End.
