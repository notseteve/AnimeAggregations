  "description" : "Production I.G has created the animation for Kao Corporation`s Asience shampoo creative challenge, entitled Asience: Hairy Tale. The 60-second animated film is directed by Kazuto Nakazawa, who gained international fame by directing the animation part in Quentin Tarantino`s world hit Kill Bill: Vol. 1. Nakazawa also designed the characters and directed the animation. Art direction has been entrusted to Shuichi Hirata, the texture wizard behind the stunning artwork of Cannes-nominated Innocence and Annecy-selected xxxHOLiC - A Midsummer Night`s Dream.\nThe graphic style in Asience: Hairy Tale is visually inspired by XVIII century Japanese paintings, and personalized by Nakazawa`s nervous and expressive brush touch used for the characters outlines. Without any support from 3D animation, the brush lines were painstakingly traced with pencil on paper by the in-between staff. The story concept, focusing on woman`s hair as metaphor of feminine life, is portrayed as a tragic love story in a samurai drama fashion.",
