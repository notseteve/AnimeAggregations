ZEMAL subsequently tries to enter the castle with a sign that says, \"We’re not your enemy; let us into the castle!\" They fail as Pitohui sabotages them. LPFM`s drone, considered the jewel in their operations, gets shot down by NPC attacks. Pitohui suggests everyone from the other teams cooperate in a coordinated attack.
