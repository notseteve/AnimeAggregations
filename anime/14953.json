Worse, they seem to have a major new competitor: http://anidb.net/ch110518 [Goryou Daranimaru], of the Goryou Bureau of Supernatural Investigation. He was an upperclassman of Muhyo at Magical Law School and, while not on Muhyo`s power level, is nonetheless a capable enough enforcer that, with his trusty judge assistant http://anidb.net/ch110522 [Ebisu], he can tackle spirits plenty well and has built a nationwide chain of bureaus. Roji and http://anidb.net/ch97106 [Nana] find that out themselves when Goryou and Ebisu show up when Nana goes to check on two friends who had been playing Kokkuri-san (basically Ouija) and accidentally summoned a real spirit. But Goryou`s pricing and business methods are ruthless, and he further seeks to take over Muhyo`s own bureau. Meanwhile, http://anidb.net/ch95133 [Enchu] is having problems with fake forbidden texts.\nSource: ANN",
