After witnessing a boy burning people with his blue flame, she is startled to see that the same boy is the transfer student http://anidb.net/ch40974 [Oogami Rei]. Rei is a Code Breaker, someone who does not exist. He is a seemingly cold-blooded killer following the principles of an eye for an eye, and to use evil against evil. Convinced that killing is not right, Sakura sets out to stop him and penetrate his icy heart.\nSource: MangaUpdates\nNote: The first episode received an early screening on 8 September 2012 at Space FS Shiodome in Tokyo. The regular TV broadcast started on 7 October 2012.",
