  "description" : "Tenka Momose was a quiet and withdrawn child, but before long she realized that the most effective way to protect herself wasn`t hiding from the other kids—it was being the best at everything! After years of armoring herself with excellence, Tenka lives safely atop her cool-girl pedestal, admired and idolized by everyone. But her flawless composure is suddenly shaken by a very average schoolmate`s impressively big dreams. At first Tenka is scornful of Erian Sato`s ambition of becoming a K-pop idol, but the other girl`s passion is so irresistible that Tenka soon finds herself with idol dreams of her own!\nSource: Viz",
