Mitsuki-sensei taught her a great deal, both inside and outside classes. Gilbert-sensei gave everyone energy with his bright smile and cheerful nature. Yoshinosuke-sensei had a cool exterior, but always offered his caring support. Not to mention all her unique schoolmates... Sayuri found a lifelong treasure in her time at Fleurir.\nSource: crunchyroll",
