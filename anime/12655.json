  "description" : "* Based on http://anidb.net/cr13938 [Fujiko Fujio A]`s horror manga.\nIn a society filled with people who do whatever with their lives, there are some who struggle with it or never achieved their goals. The story focuses on individuals who meet a shadowy and ominous salesman, http://anidb.net/ch86705 [Moguro Fukuzou], who promises them a better life if they follow his advice. However, the clients that Moguro meet often cheat, refuse to rely on his help, or worse - deny that they received assistance at all. When this invariably happens, Fukuzou punishes his clients by using their reliance on his aid against them. With their lives ruined, he is satisfied with his job and looks for more potential clients.\nSource: Wikipedia",
