One day, the old woman brings home a big peach that came floating down the river. When the old woman cuts the peach open, there is a sprightly boy inside. He punishes an ogre who was harassing the villagers, then he decides to go and defeat the ogres living on Ogre Island. The old man and woman make him some millet dumplings, known as kibi-dango. On the way, a monkey, a dog, and a pheasant join him. After crossing the ocean and reaching the palace where the ogres live, Momotaro and his companions make the chief ogre surrender. With gold, silver, coral, and other treasures in hand, Momotaro returns triumphant to his village.\nSource: National Film Archive of Japan",
