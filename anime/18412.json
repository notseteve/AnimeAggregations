  "description" : "Naoe-kun, a massage therapist, is about to head home for the day when he`s saddled with a rather strange patient. This lovely lady has emerald eyes, pointy ears, and grew up in the forest–everything about her screams \"elf,\" except for one thing: her bodacious body. It turns out she left her world but loves junk food in this one, and now her obsession has caught up with her. Can Naoe-kun help this lovable elf girl lose the weight–and keep it off?\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
