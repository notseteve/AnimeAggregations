  "description" : "Twenty-year-old former wage slave Tanaka Yuki now works among her idols: the streamers of Live-On, one of Japan`s top VTuber companies. As the gorgeous, polite http://anidb.net/ch135757 [Kokorone Awayuki], she delivers only the most ladylike content. Unfortunately, her subscriber count and savings are at rock bottom. One evening, after Yuki thinks she`s ended her stream, she cracks a few cold ones—and more than a few crude jokes—while watching Live-On`s video archives. But her viewers hear it all, and clips of her bawdy, drunken commentary go viral overnight. Yuki thinks her career is over...until her manager reveals that everyone at Live-On has been waiting for her to snap all along and gives her free rein to drink on-stream. Now free of all feigned purity, she jumps right into her new \"rowdy drunk\" character and is welcomed into the fold by her fellow Live-On VTubers, who turn out to be just as crazy as she is! With her views and finances skyrocketing, Yuki`s work—for the first time in her life—is actually fun!\nSource: J-Novel Club",
