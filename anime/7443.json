  "description" : "* Based on a light novel series titled Miniskirt Uchuu Pirates by http://anidb.net/cr8563 [Sasamoto Yuuichi], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr16113 [Matsumoto Noriyuki].\nMost families have a skeleton or two in the closet, but http://anidb.net/ch35552 [Marika] is understandably shocked to learn that what her family has been hiding is a skull and crossbones! And while the revelation that her late father was a space pirate would have been earthshaking enough for most teenage girls, discovering that he was the captain of the notorious pirate ship http://anidb.net/ch45948 [Bentenmaru] will change Marika`s life forever, since pirating is a family business, and she just inherited the position of captain. Understandably her father`s former crew is quite intent on making sure Marika accepts the job. So what is she to do? Well, if you are a high school student whose prior total naval experience has been working at the space yacht club, intergalactic buccaneering will come as a challenge...\nSource: Sentai Filmworks (edited)",
