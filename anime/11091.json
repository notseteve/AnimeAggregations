  "description" : "The story takes place in two mountain villages separated by a fast flowing river. The divided communities feud with each other, with the young boys calling names and throwing rocks at each other across the deep gorge. A young girl on one side of the river collects flowers which she offers the boys on the other side of the river as a gesture of goodwill, but she is cruelly struck down by stones. A young boy tries to stop his older peers from continuing to throw stones at her and is struck down himself. From that moment on the feelings blossom between the girl and the boy, but the terrible current of the river and the traditions of their communities keep separating them. Eventually, the boy grows into a young man and decides to build a bridge to connect the two villages.\nSource: Nishikata Film Review",
