  "description" : "The year is 2052 – an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity prevails across the globe. The reason for this: mankind has been freed from sickness and pain. Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist http://anidb.net/ch144028 [Dr. Skinner] has developed a miracle cure-all drug with no apparent drawbacks called Hapuna. Hapuna soon becomes ubiquitous... and essential. However, soon after Hapuna is officially introduced, Dr. Skinner vanishes.\nThree years later, the world has moved on. But Dr. Skinner has returned – this time, as a harbinger of doom. Skinner announces that Hapuna has a short half-life. Everyone who has taken it will die approximately three years later. Death is coming for this sinful world – and coming soon.\nAs a response to this threat, a special task force of 5 agents is gathered from across the world to save humanity from Skinner`s plan. This group is called \"Lazarus.\" Can they find Skinner and develop a vaccine before time runs out?\nSource: Adult Swim",
