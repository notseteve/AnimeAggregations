  "description" : "* Based on a romantic comedy manga by http://anidb.net/cr18553 [Wakaki Tamiki].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch139641 [Takuya] and http://anidb.net/ch139642 [Rika] are coworkers in a travel agency in Tokyo. They`re both single, but they don`t mind, since they`re introverts with fulfilling lives at home. Unfortunately, now their job is looking to staff an office in Siberia, and non-married employees are the first to be considered. Rika is desperate to avoid the transfer and goes to Takuya with an idea: if they pretend they`re getting married in a year, they can stay in Tokyo. The only problem is the two of them barely know each other! If these two quiet coworkers \"fake\" a relationship, will it turn into something real?\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
