  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy isekai light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr75215 [Shinozaki Kaoru] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr75216 [KWKM].\nAbruptly catapulted into a fantasy world, Mimori Touka and his classmates have been summoned by the world`s resident Goddess to serve as heroes. Luckily, most of the students display amazing skills upon arrival—except for Mimori, whose abilities bottom out at a measly E-rank. With no further use for him, the Goddess banishes Mimori to a dungeon from which no one has ever returned alive. Yet, as it turns out, Mimori`s skills aren`t so much worthless as they are abnormal. Abnormally powerful, even. If Mimori can only claw his way back to the surface, nothing will stand in his way from getting revenge.\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
