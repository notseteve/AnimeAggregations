  "description" : "* Based on the original novel Lassie Come-Home by http://anidb.net/cr8646 [Eric Mowbray Knight].\nJohn is a cheerful and energetic young boy, who lives in a small coal-mining town in England. One day he finds a small dog lost in a flock of sheep. John takes him back home and names the puppy Lassie. Soon they become good friends, just like real siblings. Lassie is a very lovely and smart dog, so everyone in the town loves her very much.\nBut their happy life doesn`t last long. Suddenly a coal-mine owner closes his company because there is no more coal left in the coal mine. John goes to meet the coal-mine owner to request a further investigation. The owner accepts John`s request, but in exchange for that, he takes Lassie to Scotland.\nPriscilla, the owner`s granddaughter and also John`s friend, cannot just stand by and let Lassie suffer in a cage. She opens the cage and sets Lassie free. Lassie sets out on a very long and hard journey from Scotland to her hometown.\nSource: AnimeNfo",
