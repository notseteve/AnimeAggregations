  "description" : "* Based on the manga series by the same name written and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr38936 [Puyo], itself a spin-off of the http://anidb.net/a3651 [Suzumiya Haruhi] light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr536 [Tanigawa Nagaru] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr518 [Itou Noizi].\nHigh school first year http://anidb.net/ch74080 [Nagato Yuki] is a shy, insecure young girl who spends her time in the literature clubroom. As the literature club president, she spends a tranquil life alongside her only two fellow club members, http://anidb.net/ch74082 [Asakura Ryouko], who is also her best friend, and http://anidb.net/ch74081 [Kyon], the boy she has a crush on. However, her peace is about to be disturbed by loud, pushy, bossy people such as http://anidb.net/ch74085 [Suzumiya Haruhi], a strange, forceful girl from another school, and http://anidb.net/ch74084 [Tsuruya], a second year with an explosive personality. If the arrival of the two girls wasn`t enough to poor Yuki, both also tend to bring out the worse in Ryouko, not to mention the fact the two also drag a tag-along with them: Haruhi bosses transfer student http://anidb.net/ch74086 [Koizumi Itsuki] around, and Tsuruya seems to have glued school idol and fellow second year http://anidb.net/ch74083 [Asahina Mikuru] to her.\n— written by Hinoe\nNote: The first episode received a special advance screening on March 22, 2015. The official screening began on April 4, 2015.",

Kyon however remembers this all too clearly and is as a result very awkward to her. Haruhi and Koizumi visit the Literature Club again, and press Kyon into helping find a nice bamboo sapling to use for hanging written wishes as it is July 7, the Tanabata festival. Haruhi remembers that she met Kyon long ago, as he helped her produce her \"message to the aliens\", though he has forgotten about this himself.",

Over the next several days Haruhi has them doing batting practice, bowling, and so forth. Kyon continues to be awkward, until the summer festival. He comments to Ryoko that he must seem very indecisive, and she agrees and says that the current Yuki must be wondering why he is keeping his distance. As the festival fireworks start, Kyon decides to take Yuki aside, pulling her along, until he reaches a secluded spot. Yuki can`t hear what he`s saying amid the fireworks, but the other Yuki hears him as he confesses that he would have fallen in love with her too. Haruhi seems to be discontented by what Kyon and Yuki seem to be doing. Kyon, having said what he had to say, begins to treat Yuki normally again.",
