  "description" : "* Based on the Babylonia Singularity of Fate/Grand Order, the Japanese smartphone role-playing game created by http://anidb.net/cr58840 [Delight Works] based on the Fate series by http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon].\n2017 A.D. The last era in which Magecraft still existed. Society was created by human hands, but Mages grasped the truth of the world. Magecraft is comprised of techniques from past humans that cannot be explained by science, while science encompasses the techniques of future humans that Magecraft cannot achieve. Researchers and scholars of both Magecraft and science have been gathered to maintain human civilization under the Chaldea Security Organization. But calculations then proved the extinction of humanity in 2019.\nThe cause of this is \"realms that cannot be observed\" that suddenly appeared in various eras of history, called \"Singularities\". http://anidb.net/ch85954 [Fujimaru Ritsuka], the one Master remaining in Chaldea, has been intervening within these Singularites, alongside the Demi-Servant http://anidb.net/ch93492 [Mash Kyrielight]. He has been attending to the forbidden rituals to resolve or destroy the Singularities: the \"Grand Order\".\nA seventh Singularity has been discovered—in ancient Mesopotamia in the year 2655 B.C. The land of Uruk, governed by the wise King http://anidb.net/ch104839 [Gilgamesh] after his return from a journey seeking immortality, was grand and prosperous until three goddesses and countless Demonic Beasts appeared. These enemies have brought Uruk to the brink of destruction. With a \"Rayshift\"—a method of time travel to the past—Fujimaru and Mash arrive in the lands of Uruk to encounter the fortress city of Uruk and the Absolute Demonic Front, fighting back the fearsome attack of the Demonic Beasts. There, the people who live their lives to the fullest despite facing a major threat, continue to fight for their future. Deities and Demonic Beasts make their assault, and mankind stands up against it... It is the destined era where humans and gods part ways.\nFujimaru and Mash, the pair who have raced through six previous Singularites, embark on their final battle.\nSource: Official website\nNote: The first two episodes received an early screening in Stuttgart, Germany on Sep 29",

As soon as they land in those lands where the gods exist on an everyday basis, they are assaulted by an overwhelming number of Demonic Beasts.
