Upon Mikado`s arrival, Masaomi warns him about relevant people to never cross in the city, such as http://anidb.net/ch12152 [Heiwajima Shizuo], a violently short-tempered and ridiculously strong man in a bartender suit; http://anidb.net/ch12153 [Orihara Izaya], a dangerously well-informed information broker; and a mysterious gang known as the http://anidb.net/ch14864 [Dollars]. Mikado does not take long to find that, those clearly dangerous people aside, Ikebukuro is home to many more mysteries, such as a female biker who is known as the http://anidb.net/ch12149 [Black Rider] over riding around town clad in black on a black motorcycle that occasionally neighs like a horse, and who is also rumoured to have no head under her helmet.\n— written by Hinoe",
