  "description" : "Rookie teacher Abe Haruaki is as cowardly as they come. It`s hard enough for him to handle human students without whimpering-and now he`s going to be teaching at a school full of monsters?! It`s a classroom of horrors for Haruaki, as his mischievous students use every means at their disposal to prank him!
