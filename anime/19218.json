  "description" : "* Based on a love comedy manga by http://anidb.net/cr80434 [Azuma Fuyu].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch147194 [Kashiwada] and http://anidb.net/ch147193 [Oota] are classmates at a junior high school. Oota is always thinking of pranks to surprise Kashiwada, but he always fails. Kashiwada likes to look at Oota, for he shows his emotions on his face too much. They look like opposite type of people, but they both care about each other.\n\"Look, Oota is up to something...\" Other classmates love to see the unique relationship between them.\nSource: BookWalker\nNote: The first episode received an early screening at a special event on 3 July 2025 at Anime Expo 2025 in Los Angeles, United States.
