      "description" : "The day of the amusement park date has finally come. Izumi-kun is all fired up as he works out a plan to make sure Shikimori-san has a good time. After some shopping at a store that sells costume goods, the first attraction they head to is one based on the tale of Sleeping Beauty. The line is long, but since they`re together, the time flies by. When they finally board the ride, it`s so comfortable that Izumi-kun falls asleep, and when Shikimori-san sees this... The distance between them continues to shrink!\nSource: Crunchyroll",
