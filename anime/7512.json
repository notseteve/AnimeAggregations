      "description" : "During the Westernization of an alternate Japan, humans and spirits coexist. However, some spirits have been causing trouble, and the Ministry of Spirit Affairs is established to maintain harmony. Lieutenants Kei Agemaki, Riken Yoshinokazura, and Ganryu Hanakiri are chosen to represent the humans. They are introduced to their female half-spirit partners: Zakuro, Susukihotaru, and twins Bonbori and Hozuki, respectively. While Susukihotaru, Bonbori, and Hozuki are delighted, Zakuro is disgusted with humans and their acceptance of Jesuit ideas. However, she becomes smitten with Agemaki. Shortly after, spirits Sakura and Kiri play around Agemaki, who immediately becomes nauseous and falls over. In private, Yoshinokazura advises Agemaki against working with spirits as Agemaki`s fear of spirits is severe. Agemaki believes that he has no alternative because of what his father might say if he learns about Agemaki`s fear. That night, Agemaki walks through the manor and is frightened by the spirits. He runs into Zakuro and hugs her. She interprets this as a romantic gesture. However, he asks her to accompany him to the outhouse because he is too scared to go alone. She becomes angry and wonders how she became smitten with a coward. In the morning, the representatives attend a flower viewing. While they are walking, a crowd stares at the spirits and whispers behind their backs. Zakuro points out that they are used to this and tells Agemaki that he is no different from the crowd. Lightning strikes the ground, and the lightning beast Raiju appears. Because Raiju is well-behaved, the spirits are unconcerned. However, Raiju attacks. Agemaki rescues Sakura and Kiri, but is too frightened to run away. The girls fight and return Raiju to a calm state. As the representatives continue their party, the spirits wonder why Raiju lost control.\nSource: Wiki",

Her mother`s voice tells her that she should not climb persimmon trees because they are connected to the underworld. At breakfast, Agemaki offers Zakuro a candle to eat, believing that fox spirits eat candles, however, this enrages Zakuro and she leaves. Agemaki tells Kushimatsu that he was researching spirits because he wanted to understand Zakuro so he could help her as a partner. The representatives are sent to investigate a hotel construction site. However, construction has stopped because a spirit is scaring the workers. Although talking to the spirit is sufficient, the hotel`s owner requests that the spirit be exterminated. Reluctantly, they begin searching for the spirit. However, Zakuro leaves Agemaki by himself. While looking for Zakuro, Agemaki runs into a large, shadow-like spirit. It attacks him, but stops short when it sees he is afraid. The other representatives arrive and pursue the spirit. Zakuro tells the spirit that she wants to talk. However, it does not cooperate. Zakuro slices the column, causing the hotel to collapse. Outside, Zakuro explains that the spirit`s true, small form is revealed with light. Because of Westernization, the area is illuminated at night. In addition, the spirit`s shrine was destroyed by the construction, so it tried to scare the humans away. She laments the loss of human respect for spirits. However, the hotel`s owner is upset that the spirit was not exterminated and his hotel is ruined. To compromise, Lieutenant Hanadate offers to restore the shrine and have the hotel built on military land. He thanks a smitten Zakuro for reminding him to remember the other important things.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "Zakuro and Agemaki are left alone in the house while the others are out on investigations and because of that Zakuro is bored and irritated. Before too long, a client comes to see Kushimatsu about a job that he wants to be done. Zakuro jumps at the chance of taking the case because it is about girls that have been spirited away. Though she is reluctant, Kushimatsu allows Zakuro and Agemaki to take the case of the client`s village. Before they leave, Kushimatsu lets Agemaki know why Zakuro is so impatient about the case by telling him about how half-spirits are born and the connection to Zakuro. During the investigation, Zakuro begins to hear voices calling her and realizes that this is the same voice that lured the girl away from the village to be spirited away. That night, Zakuro and Agemaki are asked to sleep in the same room and unlike Agemaki, Zakuro is surprised an embarrassed by the idea. When they finally settle down to sleep, Zakuro asks why Agemaki has been so cautious around her and Agemaki tells her about what Kushimatsu told him. Zakuro tells him about her mother and why she cannot let these kinds of cases go. As they sleep Agemaki is awakened by Zakuro leaving the room. He realizes that she is unconscious and is being led by the voice so he follows her. When she finally awakens, they are in front of a dark cave where a demon resides. They find out that the girls are not being spirited away, but being eaten by the demon. Zakuro defeats the demon and they both leave the cave by morning. Agemaki starts to feel guilty about having her always save him from the demons and Zakuro quietly disagrees with him.\nSource: Wiki",

Orikata explains that a customer obtained it through \"a secret channel\" and later noticed everyone around her met with unfortunate events. She gave the sword to Orikata, who refuses to sell it. When Orikata shows them the sword, Susukihotaru begins to breathe heavily and sweat. After, Hanakiri, Bonbori and Hozuki try to locate the customer and leave Yoshinokazura and Susukihotaru to take the sword home. The twins believe the sword was affecting Susukihotaru as she can empathize with objects and other people. At the shop, Mugi, a spirit working for Orikata, shows Susukihotaru a comb. Susukihotaru touches it and sees Mugi and her mother attacked by a swordsman. Susukihotaru learns Mugi does not remember this and tells Mugi that her mother will come if she is good. When Yoshinokazura asks Susukihotaru how she knew Mugi`s mother, Susukihotaru admits that she was hiding something for fear of what he might say. Before she can elaborate, Mugi falls trying to take the sword off of a dresser. The sword falls into Susukihotaru`s hands, and she sees the sword killing spirits. She draws the sword and attacks. As Orikata protects Mugi, Mugi remembers her mother dying. Yoshikazura catches the blade and cuts his hand, causing Susukihotaru to regain control. Later, Susukihotaru says she does not deserve the concern Yoshinokazura has for her. He realizes her ability to empathize and tells her that because he does not say much, he appreciates her knowing what he is feeling. She cries and tells him that she hopes he knows what she is feeling. Hanakiri and the twins return unsuccessful, and the group leaves for home. That night, Kushimatsu and Amaryoju wonder if the incident was a coincidence or orchestrated.\nSource: Wiki",

Hanadate requests that representatives attend that night`s military gala and pinpoint the killer. At the gala, the representatives pair off and split up. Hanadate immediately asks Zakuro to dance with him, telling her that it will be easier to watch the women while dancing. In the balcony, Agemaki tries to hide his jealousy while the twins attach magical petals on the women. They explain that they can sense the presence of anyone a petal is attached to when a twin is singing. When the dance is over, Zakuro is left by herself. She is approached by two soldiers who wish to touch her ears. Although she protests, they tell her that causing a scene will hurt the reputation of the Ministry of Spirit Affairs.

Shortly after, a petal has been destroyed. Hanakiri and the twins track the destroyed petal and discover Hanadate is trapped in a giant web.

Before the Black Widow kills her, Zakuro arrives and stabs the Black Widow, who reverts to her human form.

Agemaki is surprised that a spirit still resides in the house. The pair are called down to dinner, where Zakuro learns that Agemaki`s father wholeheartedly supports Westernization and is greatly prejudiced against spirits. She also notices that Agemaki`s sister is feeding a cat. He explains that when he was younger, a spirit frightened him. His father scolded him for being afraid. Later, Agemaki noticed that his cat, Itsue, was missing. Although he promised to apologize for whatever he did wrong or give up some other treasure, Itsue never returned. Zakuro tells Agemaki that Itsue has always been in the house. She asks Itsue to change form and appear to Agemaki. When Agemki can see Itsue, he finds that she was the spirit that frightened him. Zakuro explains that when a cat is loved, it becomes a cat demon. Itsue simply wanted to thank Agemaki for being kind. She notes that most humans cannot see Itsue in her original form, but there seems to be an exception. The next morning, Agemaki`s mother apologizes for her husband`s discourtesy, hinting that she realizes Zakuro is a spirit.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "The three maids are curious about the relationships between the representatives. The twins tell them that human girls play kokkuri to answer such questions. At the same time, Hanadate reports that a strange spirit appears whenever kokkuri is played. Although it has not harmed anyone, he wishes to prevent future damage. So, the group decides to play the game. When they begin, a spirit-like being appears, however, it is just a visualization of the feelings of humans who mistook it for the kokkuri`s appearance. The maids and the twins immediately ask it questions about Agemaki`s romantic interests. Zakuro does not want to know the answer and tries to stop the kokkuri, causing it to flee. In the courtyard, she attacks it with her blade with no effect. Before it escapes, they hear a voice asking about love. Lord Amaryoju believes that the kokkuri will disappear after witnessing a demonstration of love. However, the love does not have to be genuine. Feeling that he must help, Hanadate accompanies Zakuro and Agemaki. The three of them find the kokkuri. Agemaki begins to say he loves someone, however Zakuro stops him because she does not want him to say something he does not mean. Impatient, the kokkuri charges toward Hanadate. He professes his love for Zakuro. She replies that she loves him, and the kokkuri disappears. Zakuro thanks Hanadate for lying, but he insists that he is a poor liar. Later, Susukihotaru and the maids ask Zakuro if she loves Hanadate or Agemaki. Angry, Zakuro states she is confused because of them. Agemaki realizes Zakuro does not mean what she said to the kokkuri, but he does not understand why he is depressed. Elsewhere, Rangui tells a masked man that he is lying when he describes himself as a poor liar.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "At a festival, the representatives pay their respects to Lords A and Um, a pair of komainu-like spirits. When A and Um ask Zakuro and Agemaki are lovers, she denies it. After, the representatives race each other through the festival`s maze. Zakuro refuses to go with Agemaki, but they run into each other in the maze. Agemaki wants to apologize if he made Zakuro angry, but she insists that she is not angry. Eventually, Zakuro admits that she does not hate humans. Agemaki takes her hand and leads her. When he asks her if she knows how he feels about her, she runs away. Soon after, she is surrounded by light. Elsewhere, Rangui tells the masked man that she captured Zakuro. Zakuro dreams that she is in a flower field with her mother, who is taken away by small, black spirits. She awakens to find she is shackled to a bed. The masked man enters and reveals himself to be Hanadate, whose true name is Omodaka. He tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away. Zakuro wishes to return home, angering Byakuroku and causing her to cough violently. Zakuro learns that Byakuroku`s body suffers when she uses her powers and gives some of her powers to restore Byakuroku`s health. Later, Omodaka, sensing that Byakuroku has Zakuro`s power, kisses and embraces her. He is confident that Zakuro is perfect for bearing his child. The representatives learn Zakuro is at the Village of the Oracles. However, they cannot enter the Village because it hovers outside reality. Rangui, infuriated that Omodaka prefers Zakuro, tries to kill Zakuro, breaking the shackles and allowing Zakuro to escape. Upon locating Zakuro, Byakuroku tells her that many female half-spirits are imprisoned because they resemble a powerful half-spirit, Zakuro.\nSource: Wiki",

Back at the Ministry of Spirit Affairs, Kushimatsu tells the other representatives the truth about Zakuro and the Village of Oracles.\nIn the past, Zakuro`s mother; Tsukuhane, was wed to the chief of the Village of Oracles, who sought her for her powers. Soon, after she gives birth to a heir(Omodaka), she meets a human named Enaga, and fell in love with him. She attempts to escape from the village, but Enaga catches up to her and tells her that he will come with her. Unfortunately, they are caught, and Enaga is killed, but before he dies, Tsukuhane tells him she`s carrying their child(Zakuro). It is revealed that Omodaka was the one who told the Chief what happened between his mother and Enaga. Tsukuhane is put though a fox spirit ritual to turn her unborn child into a half spirit. When the child is born, they realize it has incredible powers. Tsukuhane is fearful that the Village will use her child for their own gain, so she escapes with the help of Kushimatsu.\nBack in the present, Kushimatsu explains that the pendant Zakuro`s mother had given to her acts as a seal to keep her powers restrained and to keep the Village of Oracles from finding her. Agemaki vows that he and the others will rescue Zakuro.\nSource: Wiki",

It is revealed that Rangui has manipulated Daidai; taking advantage of the envy she has for her older sister`s \"favoritism\", and causing Daidai to burn the village. As Byakuroku searches for Daidai, she is shocked to discover that her sister has been killed by Rangui. As she dies, Daidai tells Byakuroku how much she envied her. Byakuroku attacks Rangui out of anguish, but her attacks are useless, because Rangui is more powerful than before. With Omodaka`s help, the representatives battle Rangui. Rangui attacks Zakuro, but Agemaki shields her, and they are both trapped Rangui`s web with Zakuro still unconscious. Agemaki; refusing to give up since he has yet to tell her how he feels, hugs Zakuro and tells her he loves her. Zakuro wakes after she hears this. She releases her true power and destroys Rangui. As the village burns down, Omodaka goes to the room where Tsukahane`s body is. He wishes to remain with his mother and Byakuroku, having nowhere else to go, stays with him too. Zakuro, Agemaki and the others flee the village. Back at the manor, Kushimatsu tells the representatives that the Ministry of Spirit Affairs will be terminated. As everyone says their goodbyes, Agemaki tells Zakuro once again that he loves her, and Zakuro; reluctant at first, says that she loves him, too. They both kiss(though it is shown off-screen).\nEpilogue: Things look well for humans and spirits, and it seems Omodaka & Byakuroku survived. In the end, the Ministry of Spirit Affairs has been reinstated, since Agemaki and the other lieutenants pleaded with their general, who agreed. Everyone is back together.\nSource: Wiki",
