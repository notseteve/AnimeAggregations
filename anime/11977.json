Here he sees the \"Lady and the Unicorn\" tapestry, and feels a strange sense of déjà vu. Cardeas appears, sending Banagher away and then refusing Audrey`s plea that he halt the handover of Laplace`s Box, which could start another war. At the same time, the Earth Federation Forces assault landing ship Nahel Argama, which is carrying an ECOAS special forces team on a secret mission to stop the Box from changing hands, is approaching Industrial 7. Zinnerman and his comrades, who are members of a Neo Zeon remnant group known as the Sleeves who have survived Char`s Rebellion, begin negotiations to transfer the Box. But what Cardeas is offering them is merely its key. Zinnerman is also suspicious of Cardeas`s claim that he is keeping Audrey under his protection. Then they learn that Federation Forces mobile suits have engaged the Sleeves in battle.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Cardeas has been mortally wounded by Alberto, who infiltrated Magallanica, and he now reveals that he is Banagher`s long-estranged father.

The ship has also rescued Audrey, as well as Banagher`s friends Takuya and Micott. Zinnerman of the Sleeves detects the Nahel Argama`s position via a clever trap, and the ship comes under a fierce attack by Full Frontal, known as the second coming of the Red Comet, and his mobile suit Sinanju. Audrey begs Banagher to escape the ship with her in order to dispose of the Unicorn Gundam, the key to Laplace`s Box. But Daguza of the Federation`s ECOAS special forces group takes her prisoner, demanding that Frontal halt his attack. For Audrey is actually Mineva Zabi, the Zeon princess.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Meanwhile, as Riddhe confronts Marida, he is overwhelmed by a thought resonance phenomenon and destroys the Kshatriya Repaired. Marida`s last thoughts reach Zinnerman, Mineva, and the others, warning them that the sector is dangerous. With the shock of her death, the Unicorn Gundam emits psycho-waves beyond measurement, and the bewildered Angelo destroys his own machine. With Zinnerman`s help, the Nahel Argama successfully holds off the Sleeves fleet and reaches Industrial 7 airspace. At the same time, Bright enters the Cheyenne base to confront Martha and Riddhe`s father Ronan. And at Magallanica, where Banagher and Mineva are headed, Syam Vist awaits.\nSource: crunchyroll",

      "description" : "Banagher`s great-grandfather Syam Vist has been waiting for him and Mineva at Magallanica. In the first year of the Universal Century, Syam carried out the terrorist bombing of the Earth Federation prime minister`s official residence, and he has used the Charter of the Universal Century that he obtained at that point, now known as \"Laplace`s Box,\" to do business with the Federation. However, troubled by the stagnant state of the Federation, he worked with his grandson Cardeas in an attempt to find someone who could be entrusted with the world`s future. They used the Unicorn Gundam, which had the ability to discover true Newtypes, as the key to the Box. Having passed this test, along with Mineva, Banagher will now receive the Box from Syam and intends to use it for everyone`s benefit. But then Full Frontal appears in the cold sleep room, claiming that he is the Box`s legitimate inheritor. Banagher and Frontal begin a final battle over the Box.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Seeing Gael`s plight, Banagher summons the Unicorn Gundam. Riddhe also joins the fight with his Banshee Norn, and the two Gundams confront the huge mobile armor Neo Zeong. However, Frontal uses the Neo Zeong`s psycho-shards to destroy all of the Gundams` weapons. Luring Banagher to the end of space and time, he tries to plant the seeds of nihilism and despair. But Banagher refuses to give up, and he is aided by the thoughts of Lalah and others. In response, the Neo Zeong begins to self-destruct. Meanwhile, Ronan decides to use the colony laser to consign the Box to oblivion, and approves its activation.\nSource: crunchyroll",
