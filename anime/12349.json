      "description" : "Hinako is too cold to fall asleep, so she heads downstairs for a warm drink and notices a tasty smell coming from the coffee shop. Curiously, she peeks into the dark kitchen... and sees Mayuki stirring something in a large pot, chanting Chiaki`s name like some sort of spell. Hinako timidly speaks up, and Mayuki`s reaction makes it appear that she`s hiding something. Unable to bring herself to question this strange behavior further, Hinako tells Kuina about what she saw.\nSource: crunchyroll",
