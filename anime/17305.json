  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy manga by http://anidb.net/cr51819 [Shirahama Kamome].\nIn a world where everyone takes wonders like magic spells and dragons for granted, Coco is a girl with a simple dream: she wants to be a witch. But everybody knows magicians are born, not made, and Coco was not born with a gift for magic. Resigned to her un-magical life, Coco is about to give up on her dream to become a witch ... until the day she meets Qifrey, a mysterious, traveling magician. After secretly seeing Qifrey perform magic in a way she`s never seen before, Coco soon learns what everybody \"knows\" might not be the truth, and discovers that her magical dream may not be as far away as it may seem...\nSource: Kodansha",
