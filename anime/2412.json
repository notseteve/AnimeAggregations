  "description" : "* Based on http://anidb.net/cr22904 [Umeda Youko]`s manga.\nKatsumi has been playing baseball for years, disguising herself as a boy. However, one day she is recognized and scouted by Hoshiyama, the manager of the Chunichi Dragons, who offers her a chance to become a professional player. After Katsumi joins the Dragons and befriends their new catcher Oikawa, her skills win over one suspicious mind after another, and she becomes a star pitcher leading the team to victories.\n— written by Singan\nNote: Although their opponents were fictional, team members of the Chunichi Dragons were based on the real-life team. Hoshiyama, depicted as the manager of the Dragons, was a real-life sports commentator at the time.",
