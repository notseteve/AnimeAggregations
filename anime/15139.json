  "description" : "* A promotional anime that expresses the world where the future mobility \"FlatFormer\" that Hino Motors aims to develop exists.\nIt`s the year 20XX, and the latest technologies are protecting the nature of rural towns. The main character, http://anidb.net/ch106376 [Ruuto], and http://anidb.net/ch106377 [Michi], are childhood friends. They get along great and have grown up in this town together. They especially have fond memories in the sunflower field. The time they spent there was truly a special moment for them. But during the second year of junior high, as Michi moves to an urban area, the two drift apart. Ruuto doesn`t want Michi to forget him. Michi doesn`t want to show her weak side. The two friends go their separate ways. Mobility services transcend space and time and connect their hearts.\nSource: Official website",
