He, however, has hit rock-bottom in terms of confidence and self-belief, thanks to a traumatic three years in his middle school - Mihoshi academy - and switched to Nishiura just to get away from it all. The team`s catcher, http://anidb.net/ch11267 [Abe Takaya], thinks otherwise and believes that Mihashi has the control and skill required, and with his lead, could take them all the way to Koshien.\nGuided by an enterprising http://anidb.net/ch28808 [coach] and an innovative mentor, the team slowly gel as a unit and train hard to make a mark in the upcoming summer tournament.",
