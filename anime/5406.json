  "description" : "* Based on a light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr1432 [Hasekura Isuna].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch2818 [Kraft Lawrence] (Spice) is a travelling medieval merchant, who finds a 600-year-old pagan harvest deity named http://anidb.net/ch29 [Holo] (Wolf) in his wagon one night. She begins travelling with him, and her wisdom helps increase his profits. But her true nature draws unwanted attention from the church...\nNote: The novel series won the Silver Prize in the 12th Dengeki Novel Awards. The story forgoes the traditional sword-&-sorcery adventure element to focus on how people lived and did business in the Middle Ages.",

In the fields surrounding the village, Lawrence meets a girl claiming to be the legendary wolf deity, Holo. Lawrence, in disbelief, asks her to prove it so the girl returns to her wolf form before disappearing. Back in town, Lawrence meets with a younger girl named Chloe, a former student of his. She asks if she can become Lawrence`s business partner, but he declines, telling her that she is too young to make such a risky move. After leaving the town, Lawrence meets Holo again and learns that she escaped the town so that she can visit her homeland in the north. Lawrence agrees to let her accompany him on his travels.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Lawrence burns the ropes binding him and reunites with Holo. She refuses to tell him what she did to placate the wolves` wrath, and then chides him again for being too nice and protecting her clothes instead of running away on his own. After being told of Liebert`s betrayal, Holo transforms into her true form. With Lawrence riding on her back, she catches up with their betrayers and Nora, who is still oblivious about the betrayal and their plan to murder her. Holo routs the men but spares Liebert, who reveals that Remerio betrayed them at the very beginning because the gold procured was only one-sixth of the intended profit. Lawrence uses this information to blackmail the president of the Remerio Company, extorting 500 gold coins over a period of ten years. Lawrence does, however, allow them to keep and use the smuggled gold to save the company from bankruptcy. After reassuring Holo of his devotion, Lawrence continues on his journey with her. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "While in the town of Patzuille, Lawrence decides to purchase a better set of clothes for Holo. However, Lawrence only has a gold piece, too large denomination to purchase clothes. They return to Weiz, intending to exchange it for silver and agree to meet later at a tavern for drinks. Lawrence uses a \"secret technique\" to buy clothes for Holo that were once worn by a noble. He first buys cheap blankets at an inflated price to buy the expensive clothes at an extremely cheap price, made even cheaper by Holo`s charm. Though the clothing merchant makes a profit on the blankets, he loses money on the entire deal because of the more expensive clothes.\nSource: Wikipedia",
