As Ieyasu has doubts about whether she can do this, the producer takes her to see Rosary, showing how she never gave up, convincing Ieyasu to keep trying. As Ieyasu makes her debut as an idol, she ends up becoming more popular than Rosary, which leads her to become bitter towards her. Following the argument, Ieyasu remembers coming from the Sengoku world and is approached by the shrine maidens and is brought before Nobunaga. Wanting to stay and become an idol, Ieyasu relinquishes her secret treasure to Nobunaga.\nSource: Wikipedia",
