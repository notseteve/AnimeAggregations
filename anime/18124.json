Those sentenced to the fate of a hero are forced to fight at the front lines against the demon king`s army—and if they die, all they can expect is to be revived and continue the battle. But when their leader, convicted of killing a goddess, meets another goddess himself, the contract they forge may be enough to change the world...\nSource: Yen Press",
