While he is walking along the school grounds he sees a handkerchief falling from the window of a dormitory building. He picks it up and jumps up to the window intending to return it, and sees a girl getting dressed. While the handkerchief is precious to her and she appreciates his returning it she is angry that he has seen her in such a state and challenges him to a duel. He proves to be remarkably skilled, and he saves her when they are mysteriously attacked from an unexpected quarter. The student council president Claudia Enfield puts a stop to the duel, saying it is invalid because Ayato has not yet completed all the paperwork for his transfer.\nHe learns from Claudia a bit about the Academy and about his opponent, Julis-Alexia von Riessfeld who is a princess from a small European country. He also asks about his elder sister, Amagiri Haruka, who mysteriously disappeared but seems to have garbled records in the Academy. He attends class and finds that Julis is also in the same class and she expresses her dislike for him, but he is befriended by his classmate Yabuki Eishirou. During lunchtime, they see Julis being harassed by Lester MacPhail, who is trying to challenge her to another duel despite having lost to her three times.",

Eishirou leaves suddenly for an errand so Ayato asks Julis how to get to the boys` dormitories, and asks her to show her around campus the following day as a favour. She agrees reluctantly remembering how he had saved her life.\nThe next day Ayato sees an that an old friend, Sasamiya Saya, is also in his class. She too offers to show him around campus, and Claudia briefly comes by to give him the forms needed to apply for use of a weapon. He settles the dispute between Saya and Julis by saying they can both show him around. Saya it turns out is almost as ignorant of the campus as Ayato, and when the tour is done, he goes off to buy them drinks. Julis is about to challenge Saya to a duel after Saya says that Julis is nowhere near as strong as Ayato, but before they can start they are attacked by the mysterious assassins who interfered with Julis`s duel with Ayato the day before. The assassins are driven off but no trace of them is found by campus security.\nAyato goes to the weapon compatibility test and sees that Lester is also trying to apply, and he too wants to take the sword Ser Veresta, just as Ayato does. Lester tests himself against it but gets a low compatibility score, that only gets lower as he attempts to dominate it, until his score becomes negative and it attacks. Ayato however is able to somehow control Ser Veresta and receives a good compatibility score with it.",

The prime suspects include Lester, and they suspect that the next one to be attacked would be Julis. Claudia thus asks Ayato to watch over Julis and help protect her.\nThe next day Ayato has sort of a date with Julis who shows him around the city. While they are having lunch Lester shows up and tries to challenge Julis yet again, and Ayato points out that his behaviour towards her has made him a suspect, which makes him very angry, but his flunkies manage to calm him down. On their way back they see a group of punks seemingly having a brawl at a park, but this is a ruse that allows them to surround Julis and Ayato, but they make short work of the punks. One punk explains how someone had hired them to rough them up a little, and he sees the man who hired them in the trees. Julis chases after him, with Ayato right behind, but there are several attackers and they manage to damage Ayato`s clothes before escaping.\nWhen they return to the dorms Julis mends Ayato`s clothes and explains how despite being a princess she befriended the children in an orphanage in her country, and how she is fighting in Asterisk to obtain the money which they badly need and how the handkerchief Ayato recovered was a keepsake of theirs.\nThe following day Julis receives a letter which makes her leave school without explanation before anyone can stop her. Claudia urges Ayato to chase her as she is evidently walking into a trap.",

In that way he manages to destroy all the puppets and defeat Silas. Just as he has finished chains materialise and lock about him and he realises that his sister had done something that sealed away part of his power so he can only use it at its fullest for at most five minutes.\nLater, Silas has come to after his defeat and is confronted by Claudia, who injures him badly so he can be interrogated.
