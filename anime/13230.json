  "description" : "The Taimashin are special needles that can control the flow of qi and exorcise evil spirits. Dr. Taima, a long and red-haired Japanese man, is an acupuncturist and a possessor of the ability to control such needles. He works with his female assistant, Tagetsu Maki, and is combating a series of paranormal events; ordinary people are being possessed and turned into demons. Taima eventually travels to the United States to discover the origins of the demonic powers but find another needle wielder, Ayakashi Kyogo.\nSource: Wikipedia",
