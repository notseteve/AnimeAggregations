  "description" : "The show was about historical events through a character who was not aware of what happened on this day in history. Sometimes photographs and film footages were mixed in with the animations to explain what historical event had taken place. The research archives came from the Mainichi Shinbun newspaper where the director`s Fuku-chan manga was printing at the time.\nNote: Instant History with 312 episodes, each being just 3 minutes long. Combined with it`s sequel http://anidb.net/a5034 [Otogi Manga Calendar] it paved the path for all the other Series.",
