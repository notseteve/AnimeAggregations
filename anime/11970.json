  "description" : "* Based on shounen manga by http://anidb.net/cr6986 [Amano Akira]\nKokonose Chuuta is an orphan who lives with his aunt. For as long as he can remember he`s had a voice in his head, but other than that he`s been a normal boy — right until the day when a strange thing follows him home and teleports him to a place filled with even more fantastic creatures. It`s a police station in space.\nSurprisingly, Rein Brickke, the Chief of the Solar System Department, tells him that their computer chose him as a potential candidate for the solar-system`s police force. However, Sonokata Misuzu, a girl from Chuuta`s school with an angelic face and ill temper who turns out to be one of Rein Brickke`s subordinates, doesn`t think Chuuta is suitable for the job.\nAlthough Chuuta was shocked at first, he decides to take the aptitude test after being urged by the voice in his head. Most importantly, he wants to prove Misuzu wrong.\nSource: MU\nNote: The first episode received a premiere airing on December 11, 2016 at United Cinemas in Tokyo. The regular television airing started on January 8, 2017.",
