  "description" : "The Dungeon City is a wicked place filled with crime, debauchery, and death. Its one shining light is http://anidb.net/ch146571 [Arwin], the beautiful Crimson Princess Knight. She and her brave party of adventurers descend into the dungeon at the city`s center, seeking a legendary treasure with the power to rebuild the princess`s fallen kingdom. Many yearn to be by her side, but that spot is already taken by http://anidb.net/ch146572 [Matthew], a man despised by all in town as a cowardly weakling. Everyone thinks he is scum who just spends her hard-earned money on booze, women, and gambling. No one in the city—not even the princess knight— knows what Matthew is truly capable of.\nSource: Yen Press",
