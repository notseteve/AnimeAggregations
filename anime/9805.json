  "description" : "* Based on http://anidb.net/cr34736 [Piyo]`s sports comedy manga Teekyuu, serialised in Comic Earth Star.\nFour girls make up Kameido High School`s Tennis Club, but they do not actually get in much tennis practice; first-year http://anidb.net/ch47680 [Oshimoto Yuri] and second-years http://anidb.net/ch47681 [Shinjou Kanae], http://anidb.net/ch47682 [Takamiya Nasuno], and http://anidb.net/ch47679 [Bandou Marimo] are all more likely to get into all sorts of situations. This may include helping out at the local nursery school by playing the part of the oni for the kids to throw beans at; or during an interview for the school`s newspaper, the tennis club shows off their skills at a tennis video game; a training camp visit ends up in what looks like an evil hideout; table tennis is more their forte; visiting a creepy old silver mine turns a tennis racket into a Buster Sword; and Nasuno decides to get a meerkat at the local pet store...\n— written by foo2\nNote: The Japanese broadcast separates Teekyuu into 12 episode long seasons, even when they air as a single block. Therefore, this entry covers the second and third Japanese seasons.",
