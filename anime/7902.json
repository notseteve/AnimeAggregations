Ten years later, the story starts with http://anidb.net/ch27805 [Igarashi Ganta], a seemingly ordinary, unassuming middle school student attending Nagano Prefecture`s middle school. An escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a simple, normal life. This all changes one day when a strange man covered in blood and crimson armour appears, floating, out of his classroom windows. Smirking madly, this http://anidb.net/ch30611 [Red Man] massacres Ganta`s entire class and, instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in his chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect and, following a suspiciously quick trial, is sentenced to death and imprisoned in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme-park-like prison.",

Being the only survivor out of the entire class, Ganta is charged with mass murder and, due to the overwhelming, and doctored, evidence against him and no way to prove his innocence, he is sentenced to death and sent to Deadman Wonderland`s prison. As some of the higher ups plot to kill Ganta in an `accident`, Ganta meets a strange white-haired girl named Shiro, who manages to read his heart and understand him. When a bunch of bullies start attacking Ganta and Shiro, an explosion causes a large object to fall towards Ganta. However, Ganta`s desire to keep living so he can kill the red man activates the powers that were implanted in him, allowing him to control his blood to save himself and Shiro.",

He learns of a `Dog Race` in which he can win a big prize, which he and Shiro decide to enter. In the lockerroom, they encounter a fierce inmate named Kazumasi Kouzuma who drives fear into the others until the warden silences him. Ganta soon learns that in order to avoid being killed by a poison, he needs to eat an antidote known as Candy, which was secretly stolen from his bag by You the other day. Ganta realises that in order to survive, he needs to win the race in order to purchase a new one, but he soon learns the course is littered with actual death traps. Thanks in part to Shiro`s innocent manner, Ganta and Shiro make it to the final stage against Kasumasi where they have to hold onto a ball and avoid falling into a spike pit. Ganta decides to stand up to Kazumasi, who eventually falls to his death. In the closing moments of the round, Ganta is forced to sacrifice the ball, and the prize money, in order to keep Shiro from falling and keep their promise of eating the runner up prize together.",

Afterwards, Ganta is introduced to the other members of Scar Chain, who are plotting to expose Deadman Wonderland`s secrets an inspection week, which Makina also plans to take advantage of to find out what secrets are being hidden from her. However, Ganta becomes a little distrustful when his claims of his Branches of Sin being stopped by Genkaku differ from what the security cameras show and takes his leave. Ganta later learns from Crow about how Genkaku killed Nagi`s wife, later hearing from Nagi about how each member of Scar Chain has their own ideas of freedom. As Ganta promises to take Shiro on a ferris wheel when they escape someday, it is shown that one of Scar Chain`s members, Binjou Rokudo, is a double agent for the Undertakers. Ganta decides to join Scar Chain, who begin their operation to leak information about the Deadmen to the outside world. As Nagi and Rokudo go to the security room, Ganta and the others are chased by an acid spewing robot, to which Karako opts to stay behind to save the others.",

Meanwhile, Nagi is betrayed by Rokudo and confronted by an Undertaker named Hibana Daida, who uses a special weapon to neutralize his Branches of Sin. As Hibana starts slicing off bits of Nagi`s flesh, he provokes her into chopping off his arm, giving him the opportunity to activate the elevator Ganta`s group needs to take. However, Ganta`s group is confronted by Genkaku and his men, leaving only Ganta and a few others left alive to carry the chip containing the information. While bleeding to death, Nagi makes a call to the hideout, which is heard by Shiro who catches up to Ganta and throws the chip into a fire.",
