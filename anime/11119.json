  "description" : "The anime`s story focuses on a pair of 16-year-old high school students who experience the Tohoku disaster and grow in the aftermath. Agatsuma Jun`s father is a doctor, and she worries about the future. Satou Kunpei`s father is a fisherman, and it was decided that the boy will succeed his father in the job. The pair`s lives are suddenly disrupted when the 2011 earthquake and tsunami hit their area. The two determine their futures as Miyagi Prefecture recovers in the wake of the disaster.\nSource: ANN\nNote: The purpose of the short is to thank people for help during the Miyagi prefecture`s reconstruction efforts and prevent victims` memories of the 2011 disaster from fading away.",
