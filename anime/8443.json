  "description" : "In 1980, Telecom Animation, http://anidb.net/cr917 [TMS Entertainment], and DiC Audiovisuel produced a pilot for the series, simply titled Ulysses 31. The pilot was only recorded in Japanese.\nThe story is virtually identical to episode one of the finished series, however the story was the only thing that was kept. Although all the characters were kept, some underwent major redesigns from a typical anime design to the one seen in the finished series, which is a mix of Japanese anime style and European art based on the appearance of classical Greek sculpture.\nSource: Wikipedia",
