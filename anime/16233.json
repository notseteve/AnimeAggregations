  "description" : "Liu Bi, the descendant of the fallen Han Dynasty, is attacked by Huang Geon-jeok while making a mat in Nusang Village. In anger, Yubi made a resolution of Do-won with Gwan-woo and equipment, and formed a brother-in-law. The Yubi brothers defeat Jangbo`s Hwanggeon-jeok who raided the Yuju region and rescue Dong-tak, who had been defeated and fled, but are ignored for being a medical officer, not an official. Meanwhile, in the Han royal family, after the death of the emperor, a fierce power battle between Empress Dong and Empress Ha broke out. Ha Jin, a younger brother of Ha Tae-hoo, assassinated her Dong-tae-hu to gain her power, but in the end, he too falls into the tactics of Sisang-si and dies. Aiming for this opportunity, Dong-tak leads 200,000 troops to Luoyang, takes the emperor as a hostage, and takes office as a monk. Gong Son-chan, Son Gyeon, and Jojo, who were less capable of this situation, united and went out to subdue Dong-tak, but the three Liu Bi brothers were also in the double.\nsource: oldcine.co.kr",
