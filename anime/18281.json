Then, a terrible accident befalls her. Though somehow saved from the brink of death, Yumeko wakes up a completely different person. \"This is...me...?! I`m SO cute!!\" Those around her can`t hide their surprise and wonderment at this 180°change... But, Yumeko`s new hyper-positive attitude starts to change her surroundings, too.
