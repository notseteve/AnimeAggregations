  "description" : "* Based on a French comic book series by http://anidb.net/cr53544 [Tony Valente].\nSeth is an aspiring sorcerer from the Pompo Hills area. Like all wizards, he is an \"infected\": one of the few living beings who survived the contact of the Nemesis, these creatures fallen from the sky that contaminate and decimate all those they touch. His apparent immunity made him choose a path which seemed to him to be all the more appropriate: to become a Hunter and to fight the Nemesis. But more than that, Seth wants to engage in a quest that goes beyond the simple hunt for monsters... He wants to find the Radiant, their presumed cradle. Surrounded by a faction of sorcerers, he traveled the world in search of the Radiant, under the terrible eye of the Inquisition...\nSource: M-U",
