He later finds out that the girl is http://anidb.net/ch115219 [Arima Ichika]. Ryou is somewhat of a womanizer and to repay her for saving him, he suggests giving her a kiss or going out on a date with her, in which Ichika tells him he`s creepy. This, however, opens a new door for Ryou and he falls madly in love with her. Ever since then, Ryou tries to overly express his feelings to Ichika. Ichika just keeps insulting him and says he`s being creepy, but he just seems to take it as her way of showing affection towards him...\nSource: crunchyroll\nNote: Each episode was streamed on Amazon Prime Video and Crunchyroll a week ahead of its TV broadcast, starting on March 29, 2021.
