Desslok tells Wildstar and Nova the long story of how he came to found Galman in early 2202. \n\"After leaving you when our battle against the Comet Empire (editor`s note: in reality, the Black Nebula Empire) was over, I found myself on a long journey. I could not forsee the end of the journey. I was a homeless wanderer...\" \nDesslok`s Gamilon fleet searched for a new home and found two planets near the center of the Milky Way that resembled Gamilon and Iscandar. They learned that it was the Galmans who had initially colonized Gamilon. Thus, the Galmans were the ancestral race of the Gamilons. But the Galmans had been enslaved by the Bolar Federation. Desslok`s fleet soon freed Galmania and its sister planet. And, Desslok was soon proclaimed Emperor and God. He set about the task of ridding Earth`s side of the Milky Way of the Bolars. During the formative years of the Empire, Desslok came to realise that he had actually loved the dead Queen Starsha of Iscandar. In fact, he named the sister planet of Galmania \"Starsha\" in her honour. The aggressive strength of the Galman Empire begins to worry the Star Force, who fear that Desslok is up to his old game of militarism. For the moment, they keep this to themselves. \n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",

      "description" : "Desslok recognises his responsibility in Earth`s present predicament. It was, after all, Galman proton missiles which unintentionally fell into the sun, accellerating nuclear fusion. Desslok therefore insists on using the Galman`s scientific power to save the sun. Sandor, Homer, and Galman Technology Major Cranshaw depart for Earth in five Magnetic Field Generating Plant ships. Their mission is to enclose the sun in a magnetic field to screen out much of its deadly radiation. Then, by firing more proton missiles into the sun, they expect to restore the suns natural fusion reaction rate (as if more proton missiles could fix the problem). The launch is interrupted by a Bolar missile attack. Galman`s local defense system malfunctions, being sabotaged by peace-loving Guardiana worshippers, and a medium-sized missile hits near Desslok`s central palace (see inset). After the initial wave, a giant Bolar planet-destroyer missile is detected heading for Galman. To protect the Plant Ship launch, the Star Force takes off and destroys the missile with the Wave Motion Gun. Wildstar, uncomfortable at Desslok`s military build-up, warns Desslok that his reliance on weapons and aggression will be his downfall. \nWildstar: Desslok, why not use it for peace? \nDesslok: Peace? I built them to maintain peace... Only through a war of peaceful conquest can we acheive peace in our time... \nDesslok: The Bolar sphere of influence is vast, and they have powerful weapons. This planet has been long coveted by the Bolars, and, well, I cannot let it fall into their hands again. \n[Source: The Wave Motion Web Page http://www.desslok.com]",
