And when we were there, we ran into that child again, who turned out to be the son of the painting`s artist! The boy told us that someone had defaced his father`s painting, and so he snuck into the museum in order to restore the painting to its original glory. And as it turned out, the one responsible for both the altered painting and Sakura`s sudden loss of hearing was the card known as Silent. Sakura, of course, was brave and smart enough to eventually find a way to steal the card away again. She`s just so wonderful!\nSource: crunchyroll",

He explained that Clow Reed was a magician, and created the Clow Book. He also revealed that Xiaolang is a relative of Clow Reed`s on his mother`s side. And as it happened, Xiaolang`s amazing knowledge of the Clow Cards helped Sakura seal Thunder away.

We were also really surprised to find out that Sakura`s father knew my mother! As it turned out, he used to teach both my mother and Nadeshiko. Later, Mr. Kinomoto and my mother faced off in the parents 100-meter dash. My mother had held a grudge against him for a long time, believing that if her beloved cousin Nadeshiko hadn`t married him, she wouldn`t have died so young. But before too long, the race almost came to a stop, because the track had suddenly been covered in mysterious flower petals. It turned out that the Flower card was to blame, and Sakura used her amazing talents to seal it away, just like always! But my mother ended up losing to Mr. Kinomoto, and she got... well, angry. To restore the peace, Sakura used Flower to call down a shower of nadeshiko blossoms in honor of her mother, and my mother was so touched that she totally forgot about her anger. Exactly what I would expect from the Cardcaptor.\nSource: crunchyroll",

She had half-expected that kind of answer, and after recovering she asked him to at least join her in a single dance. So romantic!\nSource: crunchyroll",

Meanwhile, the Fight card appeared and began taking on skilled martial artists all across the city. Sakura headed to Penguin Park to seal it away, but out of nowhere Meiling appeared to challenge the card! Unfortunately, she was no match for it and started to lose ground, but then Sakura jumped in and used her Power card to seal Fight away! But Meiling couldn`t stand the fact that Sakura was the one to save her, and only made her view of Sakura as her rival that much stronger.\nSource: crunchyroll",

And when the day of the race arrived, Meiling and Sakura found themselves quickly in the lead. However... they soon realized that they`d been going around and around in circles with no idea why!

But still, they all crossed the finish line together. Despite losing the race, Meiling seemed happy with the outcome. And a little embarrassed.\nSource: crunchyroll",

We snuck in together, and when we got inside we were surprised to find Xiaolang and Meiling there.

We figured out that Song will only appear when the person it`s copying- me in this case- sings for it.

Of course, Sakura realized it was the Snow card and went to capture it, btu she got caught in a snowy cyclone and lost the new watch Yukito had given gave her.

But he didn`t know why she was always on his mind, and seemed troubled by it. Eriol, Sakura, Xiaolang and I went to see the Teddy Bear Exhibit and I noticed that Xiaolang was always keeping an eye on Sakura. When I mentioned it, Xiaolang got embarrassed and wanted to go home, but instead, he and Sakura got stuck in the elevator together! Sakura said that she fell out of the elevator down the shaft, but used the Float card to save herself. Xiaolang was really worried about her though... I think the look cute together.\nSource: crunchyroll",

      "description" : "Sakura seemed a bit preoccupied at school... I wonder if it was because of Xiaolang or Eriol. After school, Eriol invited us over to his house to say goodbye and to explain everything. It turned out that all the crazy things that had been happening were actually because of him! He was trying to help Sakura become the true master of the cards. I talked to Xiaolang to find out what Sakura had said when he revealed her how he felt, and he told me that she didn`t say anything! I then found out that Xiaolang was going to leave for Hong Kong without hearing how Sakura felt! I couldn`t let that happen and made sure Sakura had a chance to see Xiaolang...\nSource: crunchyroll",
