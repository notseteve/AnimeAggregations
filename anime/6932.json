  "description" : "Morning comes and the village is holding a festival. Dangobei, a kagura performer invited from a village called Tanokyu appears. He entertains the villagers with masks of a plump-faced woman and a comically distorted male face. Before long, the festival ends. Dangobei receives money and leaves for home. Going by night sends Dangobei down the wrong path, and he wanders into the Kuragari-toge Pass. In Tanokyu, his mother worries about him. A giant snake appears in front of Dangobei who is frightened by the dark path. Dangobei quickly puts on a kagura mask. The giant snake asks him his name. He says \"Dangobei of Tanokyu\" and pleads for his life. However, the snake thinks he said raccoon dog (because Tanokyu sounds like tanuki). When the giant snake asks him to turn himself into something, Dangobei puts on each of the kagura masks, and so the giant snake excuses him. Feeling relieved, Dangobei goes to light a cigarette, but the giant snake says he hates nicotine. The giant snake asks what Dangobei dislikes. He says he hates \"money\" as it is a source of alienation between parents, children, and siblings. After running for his life to return to the village, he tells the villagers about the giant snake. Then, the villagers go to kill the giant snake. The giant snake dies from all the nicotine and angrily throws lots of koban (oval gold coins formerly used in Japan) at Dangobei.\nSource: National Film Archive of Japan",
