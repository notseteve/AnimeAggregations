  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch116595 [Yuuyu] is a boy living in Kanazawa, Kaga Province. He is 15 years old and in his third year of junior high school. He has the ability to sense the feelings of others, but he is troubled by the fact that he cannot say no when asked. One day, Yuuyu could no longer stand going along with his sister`s hobby, so he ran away from home. The one who saves him is http://anidb.net/ch116589 [Ookura Megumi]. Megumi invites Yuuyu to a nighttime amusement park called \"Wonder Hill\" where her friends hang out. At the amusement park, Yuuyu meets Megumi, http://anidb.net/ch116594 [Ishigame Zakusa], and http://anidb.net/ch116593 [Seto Tomari], members of \"Team Blackout,\" a group that meets to play Vanguard every night.\nTonight, a serious fight for the team`s flag will take place. Blackout`s leader, http://anidb.net/ch116591 [Momoyama Danji], and the mysterious and powerful fighter, http://anidb.net/ch116592 [Ebata Touya]. As Yuuyu stares at them, the card fight is soon eroded into a world of images.\nThis is how Yuuyu encounters Vanguard, a world he has never seen before, and is drawn in by its powerful allure- making new friends along the way.\nSource: Bushiroad\nNote: The first episode received a premiere on the official Vanguard YouTube channel on 24 March.
