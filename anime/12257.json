  "description" : "* Based on action-platform game released by Inti Creates.\nIt is the near future, and among humankind exists Adepts, people who possess extraordinary abilities known as Septimal Powers. The existence of these Adepts has caused widespread chaos around the world, but in the nation of Japan, order and peace is maintained by a large conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group.\n...However, this would prove to be a temporary peace, granted to the citizens of Japan by the sacrifice of countless Adepts at the hands of Sumeragi. On the surface, the Sumeragi Group appears be a rather normal, clean company. Below the surface, Sumeragi captures Adepts, holds them against their will, and performs inhumane scientific experiments on them.\nOne group known as QUILL (Quorum for Unrestricted Information, Law, and Liberty) made this discovery and pledged to revolt against the Sumeragi Group. A member of QUILL, a young man named http://anidb.net/ch87393 [Gunvolt], sets out one evening to infiltrate a Sumeragi facility in the name of freedom for his fellow Adepts.\nSource: Official page",
