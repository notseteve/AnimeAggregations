  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy shounen manga series written and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr46835 [Tabata Yuuki].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch90440 [Asta] and http://anidb.net/ch90441 [Yuno] are orphans who were raised together from birth after being abandoned at a church orphanage on the outskirts of the Clover Kingdom at the same time. In a world where everyone has the natural ability to perform a kind of magic, or a Magical Power (魔力 Maryoku), Asta is the only person born without any, leading him to train physically as compensation. Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power and the talent to control it. When they are 15, Asta and Yuno are granted the ability to become wizards known as Magic Knights by receiving grimoires, with which all magical power is channeled. Yuno is granted a wind-based grimoire held by the kingdom`s first Wizard King, while Asta does not receive one. However, when a thief incapacitates Yuno to try and sell his grimoire on the black market, Asta summons his own grimoire, which contains the rare and mysterious Anti-Magic (enabling him to cancel out all magical effects), to defeat him. The story then follows the two boys in their time within separate squads in the Magic Knights, as they build a friendly rivalry to try and become the Wizard King themselves.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Asta and Yuno were abandoned together at a church in Hage, a village in the boonies, and lived as brothers from that day onward. For some reason, however, Asta never developed the ability to use magic, even when Yuno had already mastered wind magic. Now, at last, the boys are turning fifteen, the age at which children receive their own grimoires. Asta has high hopes that receiving his grimoire will awaken his latent ability to use magic, but when the time comes...\nSource: crunchyroll",

The elf Licht possessed a four-leaf grimoire and he lived peacefully with his brethren, who trusted him greatly. One day, a human named Tetia and her older brother happened to come by their village. Her older brother also had a four-leaf grimoire just like Licht and hoped to bring humans and elves together.
