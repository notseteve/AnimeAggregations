  "description" : "The 2008 animated omnibus Indie Anibox: Selma`s Protein Coffee consists of three inventive short films from up-and-coming directors. Kim Woon Ki`s kooky mystery thriller \"Wanted\" is set in a peaceful village suddenly disrupted by heavy rainfall and the appearance of a strange old woman named Selma. Yeon Sang Ho`s 3-D animation \"Love is Protein\" is an inventive black comedy about three poor roommates who break their piggy banks to order fried chicken but are intruded by weeping chicken. Jang Hyung Yoon`s surreal \"A Coffee Vending Machine and Its Sword\" follows a swordsman who reincarnates as a coffee vending machine and falls in love at first sight with the maintenance girl.\nSource: YesAsia",
