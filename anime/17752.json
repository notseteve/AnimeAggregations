There are only five hours left until the arrow of the God Killer pierces Athena`s heart. Only the Pope, who sits atop the sanctuary, can save Athena. However, in order for Seiya and the other four Bronze Saints to reach the Pope`s Chamber, they must break through the Twelve Palaces protected by the Golden Saints. There are five more palaces waiting for them to reach the Pope`s Chamber. Can Seiya and his team defeat the powerful enemies that stand in their way and reach the Pope`s Chamber, where the shocking truth is hidden?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
