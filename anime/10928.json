  "description" : "One day, 13-year old http://anidb.net/ch71300 [Tokio Meguru] is suddenly approached by a strange girl who is running away from something. She finds out that the girl`s name is also http://anidb.net/ch71301 [Meguru], and although she appears to be around 17 years old she has a passionate personality, which the younger Meguru has trouble dealing with. Tokio Meguru gets drawn into the older Meguru`s fight with a mysterious organization, and they both get targeted by a narcissist named http://anidb.net/ch71305 [Rei].\nAlthough the younger Meguru can`t believe that the older one came from the future, she fights alongside her in a dimensional robot. After fighting with Rei, she finds out that even though the other Meguru is older than her, she is Tokio Meguru`s descendant. After finding out that someone has jumped into the past by using the older Meguru`s history surveillance device, the two also make a leap back into the past.\nSource: ANN",
