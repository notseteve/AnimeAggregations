Some dolls attack him before the Black Rabbit arrives and saves him once again. First, he is fearful of the girl, who tells him to call her Alice, but he soon warms up and begins to eat cookies. When asked by Alice why he isn`t afraid of her, he simply replies that too many unexpected incidents have happened to him already. He learned that he should remain calm whenever strange things happen in order to stop others from being hurt. She says that Oz is required to make a contract with her in order to leave the Abyss, and he seriously thinks about it, until he`s transported away. After a fake Sharon, which is actually a Chain (a monster born in and from the Abyss) misleads him, he finally agrees to form a contract with Alice. They both leave the Abyss and Raven, a mysterious new figure, Sharon and Break, her servant, find him lying on the ground just as they were about to save him.",

Alice then possesses Oz and takes Sharon hostage in order to escape, but Break stops her by forcing her from Oz`s body. After her release from Oz, Break exclaims that he will have to kill Alice. Oz forbids it, saying that Alice is not an enemy, for it was through her that he escaped the horrible Abyss. But, that it is Break who is an enemy - someone who Oz had only seen once and was now attacking his friend. Break back`s down, and blames the attack on Emily, his puppet. Oz`s pocket watch then starts to act strangely. Raven comments that the door to the Abyss had opened and a chain escaped. By using Raven`s chain`s powers, Raven was able to control the B-Rabbit`s powers from within Oz. With this power, Alice was could release her full form and defeat the chain. After the door was closed, Alice found out why it had reacted to her. The music lured her to the watch because it contained one of her memory shards.

When the trio have dinner, Oz realizes Raven`s other personality, which reminds him of Gil (especially the black hair and golden eyes).

Meanwhile, Sharon and Break are discussing the mission and how they had kept some information secret.

On the ride home, Raven informs them that the only way to stop Oz from being dragged into the Abyss when his clock makes a full rotation is to kill Alice, which initiates an argument between Alice and Raven.
