Meanwhile, a masked man armed with an axe has come to the store, intending to rob it, but Fino treats him like a customer, not realising his intentions, which distracts him.

When he returns to the shop he finds Fino asleep, and from her notebook sees that she has been practising the phrases he told her to memorise.

When a customer comes by to have a fan fixed, they see Lore Berefiral, who works doing deliveries and in-home maintenance in her rare visits to the store. Meanwhile, Sarah and Visor are called to corporate headquarters and told that although their store has the highest customer satisfaction rating however they also have the lowest sales, so they are to double their inventory, stock generic products, and conduct a major sale.\nLater, Airi visits the store, and Raul`s look on his face when he sees her makes Fino think that she`s a complainer, and Fino lets slip details that give away her demonic heritage as he tries to restrain her. Just then one of the generic products that Corporate HQ has ordered them to stock arrives at the store, an air purifier that seems to be of rather dubious quality. Elsa also comes by to visit as it is the end of her shift at the convenience store, and they decide to try to test it as the store has no other customers besides Airi. The air purifier malfunctions spectacularly, the magic gone awry producing Witch`s Arms that entangle Elsa, Nova, Lore, Fino, and Airi as their attempts to shut it down are frustrated as there are too many arms. Raul finds his old magical sword and uses it to cut Fino free, and together they manage to finally turn off the defective device.",

They try to help her, and Raul is found in a compromising situation as Sarah and Visor arrive.\nWhile Lore attempts to repair the air conditioning the store conducts a summer sale with the staff dressed in swimsuits. This becomes wildly successful, and after their work shifts Elsa, Ram, and even Airi are encouraged to participate.\nAs the day ends the son-in-law to whom they had sold an air conditioning unit comes by and tells Raul how he is a journalist for an important business newspaper and that he has written an article praising the excellent service that he received from them the other day. Amada`s upper management has also seen the article and calls in the manager of the capital shop near Leon and admonishes him for failing to destroy them.",

This is Fino`s first salary and Raul says that she should buy something memorable with it. She convinces him to come with her as she goes shopping, and she winds up buying a lot of strange things and spends all her money before he realises it.

She tells Raul what her father was like, how he tormented not just humans but weaker demons like her mother, and which is why she never wanted to become the demon lord herself. She would rather become a Leon branch manager like Sarah, of the first branch in the Demon World.\nDuring lunch break Raul joins his old friends from the hero training program Ciel and Blaze, and they tell him that the hero system will soon be restored as there will once again be a new demon lord. They were evidently the same ones who attacked Fino the other day. They depart on unsettling terms with Raul warning them not to lay a hand on her.\nMeanwhile, while Fino is having her lunch at the convenience store, she sees a customer who wanted to buy a refrigerator whose complete details she was unable to get. She chases after him and gets him to fill out the missing details in his order form, but afterwards she is abducted. Raul returns from his lunch break to find that Fino has not returned, and while searching for her finds the order form, and realises that she has been abducted.",

He finds Fino at one of the demon`s gate mock-ups they used for practice, chained to a pillar, but is attacked by Airi before he can free Fino. Airi has a hatred for all demons as they had killed her family, and she and Raul have a bitter battle. Fino, unable to watch her friends fight that way decides to accept the Bloodstone`s power and begins her transformation into the demon lord. She flies into the volcano where the gate to the demon world is.\nRaul has by then managed to defeat Airi and convince her that what she is doing is wrong, and as they are about to chase after Fino, Raid tries to stop them, but just then Sarah, Visor, Nova, Lore, Elsa, Ram, and the old man Hiramatsu arrive, and Sarah fights Raid, allowing Raul, Airi, Lore, and Ram to leave on the old man`s carriage.",
