      "description" : "The members of Senkou High School`s literature club become shocked when Andou July, a boy usually known for his chuunibyou delusions, suddenly develops superpowers of his own. Six months later, each of the club members have since developed their own superpowers, which they put to the test in their monthly check-up. When student council member Kudou Mirei comes to check on the club, she ends up misinterpreting July`s chuunibyou behavior and inadvertently reveals that she herself has developed superpowers as well. Mirei challenges the club to a superpower battle, using her own ability to steal July`s \"Dark and Dark\" ability, only to find it to be nothing more than a useless lukewarm flame. With the other members knowing not to show off their powers before her, they easily beat Mirei in a physical match. Learning that Mirei learned of the club`s powers from an anonymous text, the group become curious about just who sent it. \nSource: Wikipedia",

After having to deal with both Mirei`s over-the-top affections and the jealous glares of the other girls, July explains the situation to Mirei, who seems heartbroken from being turned down. As Kanzaki Tomoyo comes to cheer up July during his moment of guilt, he explains he chose that particular name for Mirei`s power so it would match the others and show that she was one of their friends.

The next day, after July hears from Maiya about how Sayumi had originally wanted to join the student council during high school, Mirei theorizes she may have turned it down due to her powers. This leads July to recall an incident that happened ten months ago in which Sayumi, who suggested they use her \"Root of Origin\" ability to remove everyone`s powers, battled against July who was against it. The result of that battle showed that Sayumi`s power could not erase July`s Dark and Dark, as their powers were meant to be accepted as part of themselves. Sayumi later explains that her change in attitude was purely due to her medication, also stating she has no regrets turning down the student council for the sake of her fellow club members. \nSource: Wikipedia",
