An AI with intelligence and decision-making skills that surpass human capabilities—the perfect autonomous robot, \"http://anidb.net/ch148189 [Alma]\" was created by the overlooked young genius scientists http://anidb.net/ch148191 [Enji] and http://anidb.net/ch148190 [Suzume] whose brilliance should`ve been recognized by the world! Alma calls Enji and Suzume \"Father\" and \"Mother\" which leaves them completely flustered. Regardless, the three begin a life together as a family in order to nurture Alma`s powerful AI and help her evolve into the ultimate robot. Alma`s curiosity has no limits as everything she sees and touches is new to her. Alma keeps Enji and Suzume on their toes with her unmatched learning capabilities and unstoppable energy as she explores the bigger world.\nSource: Crunchyroll",
