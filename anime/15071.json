  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy adventure light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr50703 [Aneko Yusagi] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr55879 [Minami Seira].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch97224 [Iwatani Naofumi] defeated the Spirit Tortoise, one of the Four Guardian Beasts, and followed the person behind its revival, http://anidb.net/ch123841 [Kyou], to another world. After defeating Kyou, he`s finally come back to Melromarc.\nAnother one of the Four Guardian Beasts, the Phoenix, is about to revive, and while the kingdom tries to prepare, the other three Cardinal Heroes are missing after their failure in the Spirit Tortoise battle. Naofumi`s own lands may not be ready, either. To bolster their defenses, Naofumi decides to search for the scattered members of Lurolona Village. He visits the land of Zeltoble, where he hears that some were sold as slaves. As a first step towards saving them, he, http://anidb.net/ch97221 [Raphtalia], and http://anidb.net/ch99073 [Filo] participate in an underground combat arena.\nThe demi-humans seek salvation. The other three Cardinal Heroes have had their spirits broken. And http://anidb.net/ch99923 [Bitch] (Myne) lurks in the shadows. As everyone`s plots intersect, will Naofumi be able to follow the path he believes in?\nSource: Official Website\nNote: The first episode received an early screening at Anime Expo in Los Angeles on July 3, 2023.
