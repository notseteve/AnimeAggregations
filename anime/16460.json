  "description" : "It`s a new year, and the story of Sheep and Wolffy continues to unfold in the green grasslands. This time the story is even more exciting, this group of cute little guys into the sky and into the ground, to carry out a variety of adventures, but also caused a lot of chaos. For example, the village chief and Wolffy accidentally turn into fish, forcing the sheep and Wolffy to go into the deep sea in search of a way to save them; or the animals on the green grassland travelling to the weird and wacky worlds by mistake, which leads to Dash and Black Marshal, the two unreliable fellows, being active once again, causing a lot of jokes.\n　　In the meantime, Wolffy`s son Little Ash grows up, and Wolffy aspires to train him to become a famous and unique sheep-catching expert, while Little Ash and Lazy Goat deepen their friendship, which leads to countless fun stories.\nsource: movie.douban.com/deepl",
