  "description" : "Chidori High is a boys` school that takes in the dregs of society with the lowest grades. Next door stands Kikyo Girls` High, where wealthy, high-class families send their precious daughters.\nChidori second-year Rintaro, who has a fierce face but a gentle heart, is helping at his family`s patisserie when he meets a girl named Kaoruko. The two hit it off right away but this blissful peace is quickly disturbed when Rintaro discovers that Kaoruko is actually a student at Kikyo. Worse, she doesn`t seem to realize what a huge problem this really is! Will these two be able to forge a path for themselves, and sidestep the traps (metaphorical and literal) laid by their classmates?\nSource: Kodansha",
