  "description" : "What exactly is \"Shan Hai Jing\" really about? A gourmet goes back in time to the Shanhaijing and explores the famous mountains and seas mentioned in the scriptures, and actually finds that it`s all so interesting! It turns out that there were already mermaids in China, but they weren`t pretty girls at all; it turns out that the ancients already fed their employees \"Shang bird, pay bird\" and they worked hard for 996 and 007; it turns out that the Queen Mother of the West was a strange woman and not a super lady; it turns out that Dayu fought against the water monkeys when he ruled the water! The most interesting story of Shanhaijing is in the \"Shanhaijing in Chinese\"!\nsource: bilibili.com/DeepL.com/translate.google.com",
