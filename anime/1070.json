  "description" : "A dark, powerful figure is unconscious, experiencing vivid flashbacks of Kakarotto defeating him. The scene switches to a happy one of Goten and Trunks searching for the Dragon balls, chaperoned by Videl. Goten wants to wish for lots and lots of food to eat, and Trunks wants the Dragon balls so he can go on lots of adventures. They have some fun, cute adventures finding the DBs, and eventually make it to the last one, which is strung on the necklace of a village shaman. The villagers are about to sacrifice a young, beautiful maiden to the monster god of the village, in return for their peace and well-being. Goten and Trunks fly off and defeat the monster--a really goofy dinosaur--easily. The villagers congratulate them and give them the Dragon ball, and all three Z soldiers stay in the village overnight. The next morning, Videl goes out early and runs into Brolli, who has inexplicably survived Movie #8, and has also inexplicably lost most of his brain. Brolli mistakes Videl for Kakarotto and knocks her unconscious in a lake, then goes after Goten and Trunks. The two boys spend some time running around, avoiding Brolli, and getting into hi-jinks. This goes on until Gohan steps in for no good reason and tries to fight. There`s a really typical fight in which Brolli is covered by lava, and Gohan is rescued by kuririn in a Piccolo outfit. Brolli escapes the lava, and fights back again. Goten wishes that the Dragon would defeat Brolli, and Goku`s ghost is resurrected to help them fight. Using a Triple Kamehameha, the Son family knocks Brolli into the white-hot sun. Goku disappears, leaving the question of whether or not he was really there, and everybody goes home happy.\nNote: Screened as a triple feature with http://anidb.net/a6626 [Dr. Slump: Arale-chan Hoyoyo!!

      "description" : "An investigation into the crash of a strange vessel quickly turns into a battle that not even Earth`s most powerful heroes are guaranteed to win. Broly, one of the greatest threats the universe has ever known, has returned - and this time, Goku might be powerless to stop him. Broly has gone insane from the hatred that boils inside him, an anger that burns hotter than even the pits of the fiery underworld. The entire cosmos will suffer unless the sons of Broly`s greatest rival can defeat him - and it will take nothing short of a miracle.\nSource: crunchyroll",
