  "description" : "Unpei Mochizuki is a second-year employee of a machine parts wholesaler. One day, he makes a mistake that causes trouble for his clients, and he is troubled by the thought of \"going somewhere far away...\" where no one knows him. She is a picture book author with a baby face, glasses, and an unknown age, who travels with her dog in her car. They spend their days traveling together, and they use the car as their \"Sumika\" (dwelling place). They sleep in the car and begin a new form of travel, free from the constraints of time.\nSource: M-U",
