There were sheep and goats from various tribes gathered on the field, including Pan sheep, mechanical sheep, black goat, mountain goat, sheep, Tibetan antelope and so on, which was very lively. And the cunning grey wolf naturally will not let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, he mixes into the sheep games, trying to come up with all kinds of ways to catch the fat sheep to eat. Thus, a match of wits and courage between the sheep and the wolf began again.\nsource: bgm.tv/deepl",
