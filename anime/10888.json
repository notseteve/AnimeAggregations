      "description" : "Tanikuchi Okuma enrols in the country`s leading elite public morals school from a much lower-ranked one, out of admiration for the student council president Anna Nishikinomiya. It is the morning of the first day of school, and on the train there, he notices a male student looking at him intently, who is later accused by a woman of molesting her. He knows that this isn`t true (the woman is just trying to extort the guy) so he makes a distraction, making people think that he was the molester. As he tries to get away he is surrounded by security, but the notorious terrorist Blue Tundra suddenly appears and makes an even bigger distraction that allows him to escape.\nWhen Okuma arrives in school it is obvious that there are many students who are badly repressed, such as Fuwa Hyouka, who is obsessed about how babies are really made. He is summoned to the student council and called upon to help assist investigation of the incidents of terrorist indecency that have been occurring lately. Anna directs another member of the student council, Kajou Ayame, to show him the ropes.\nIt turns out that Ayame is none other than Blue Tundra, and she blackmails Okuma into assisting with her terrorist plots. Blue Tundra`s next operation occurs during a student assembly, where she drops sexy pictures and shows a film of copulating flies to her making lewd noises, which has a terrible effect on the badly repressed students.",

The student council secretary Gouriki distrusts him (despite being the one he saved from accusations of molestation at the train), and he tells them that his father was, like Ayame`s, an activist against the new laws that created the censorship state, and was arrested and imprisoned as a result. He was ostracised for much of his childhood and only Anna, whom he met in kindergarten, showed him any kindness, so ever since he distanced himself from his father`s ideology. This convinces the council of his sincerity.\nThere is an upcoming health examination at the school, and Anna`s mother has a new bill in the wings that will tighten social control still more. Ayame performs another terrorist plot that involves conducting an \"eye exam\" that will make the students read individual letters and explain the actual process of making babies using what is considered obscene language, without tripping off their collars. He is chased by Anna and Gouriki and very narrowly escapes capture, but from a distance a student sees him remove his disguise.",

He drops the batch of pamphlets in Hyouka`s lab after Anna confronts him one more time.\nThus thwarted, Ayame and Tanukuchi try to recover the porn themselves, although this is clearly impossible for them to do alone, as there are many guards at the grove where it is hidden. However, Hyouka distributed the pamphlets herself and arrives with a large number of students, who serve to distract the guards as Ayame and Tanukuchi enter and don their SOX disguises. Anna is there however, and she fights Ayame, while Tanukuchi recovers some of the pornography and a BDSM costume that he incorporates into his SOX disguise. Though he is conflicted, he helps Ayame fight Anna, who falls down a hill into the grove.\nThe students who participated are arrested and forced to sign their support for the more repressive law Sophia is sponsoring. SOX however, managed to steal the students` signatures and replaced them with dirty pictures, so Sophia finds herself in trouble for public display of indecency and her efforts at passing the law are thwarted for the time being.",

Actual members of Moist Throng steal the underwear from Anna, who chases after them.\nAlthough the plan did not quite work, Ayame says that a lot of good came out of it: it showed that they can use Tanukichi`s underwear to distract Anna and get the student council off their tails. They repeat the plan the next day with this in mind, using Otome`s underwear as the real bait for Moist Throng instead. The plan goes remarkably well, as Tanukichi manages to subdue many Moist Throng members, until at the girls` changing room while tying up one of them, the power is cut as the fire alarm sounds. He encounters Oboro, and exposes him as a man. Anna comes in soon after to change her clothes made wet by the sprinklers, and Tanukichi makes his escape by tossing her his underwear.\nIt turns out that Kosuri had spoken to Fuwa and asked her to bring the Moist Throng students to the changing rooms where Tanukichi had been waiting, and she had also activated the fire alarm as a distraction. This concerns Ayame because it complicated the plan, establishing a link between SOX and the regular student body through Fuwa, and the fire alarm caused the incident with Oboro and Anna.\nLater, they receive a note from the leader of Moist Throng and have a confrontation with him at the park.",

      "description" : "The meeting between SOX and Moist Throng`s leader goes badly as the two groups are unable to settle their differences, and the leader leaves, hinting that they are planning something big.\nThe next day, the monorail system has broken down and Tanukichi has to rush to get to the bus. Gouriki is on the same bus and he tells him that power to the monorail was sabotaged. Ayame calls him, warning him that he must not use the buses, but one of the Moist Throng terrorists has revealed himself, hijacking the bus and threatening all the passengers with a gun. 42 such buses were hijacked. Hyouka realises that the terrorist on her bus has a fake gun, and that permits the other passengers to subdue the terrorist. Anna goes berserk and beats up the terrorist on her bus. The terrorist on the bus with Gouriki and Tanukichi is disgusted on seeing Gouriki wearing only his underwear that he is likewise subdued. Told that there is actually one gun among the 39 remaining buses that is real, the authorities are forced to tread carefully.\nTanukichi meets up with Ayame and they come up with a plan to apprehend Moist Throng and its leader White Peak themselves, thereby dissociating them from SOX. They use Kosuri`s panties as bait to lure the bus with White Peak away, and moving quickly, Tanukichi boards the bus and fights White Peak but winds up getting beaten up. Ayame arrives in her Blue Tundra disguise and the two of them manage to subdue White Peak, but Kosuri betrays them and knocks Ayame out of the bus, while the PMC chases her away. Kosuri declares herself for Moist Throng.",

Moist Throng has taken about 500 hostages and the PMC has besieged the campus. They have demanded food and drink for the hostages as well as a mass of new panties, threatening to publish compromising pictures of the hostages otherwise. Kosuri soon realises that she made a mistake betraying SOX for them, as she learns that Takuma and Moist Throng are not the revolutionaries looking to change the country she thought them to be, but just common perverts out to sate their lusts until the PMC decides to break through. She is bound and gagged as a hostage after she unsuccessfully attacks him.\nMeanwhile Tanukichi and Ayame get in contact with each other and formulate a new plan. They receive a call from Saotome who is among the hostages, and she provides intelligence on the conditions inside the school. Although Tanukichi has his reservations about this plan which goes against his ethics, he disguises his scent by constantly washing himself and goes to Anna, convincing her to temporarily ally with SOX to defeat Moist Throng and retrieve his underwear which they have stolen. Anna, Gouriki, and Oboro join Ayame and Tanukichi and together they manage to defeat Moist Throng.",

Tanukichi remembers how his father had given him a valve handle for use if he should ever go to Nukumi. This makes them decide to go there despite their misgivings. At the resort they see Gouriki and Anna, who have received similar invitations.\nThey go to the baths, where Anna has entered the men`s side in an attempt to seduce Tanukichi, but as she does this, they hear Sophia just outside being attacked by someone. They see her at the entrance to the baths, unconscious, and dressed in black underwear. She too received an invitation to go to Nikumi, allegedly from Anna, which she claims she never sent. They meet the one who sent the invitations, a man covered in black panties. He has taken all of their clothes and left them black underwear to wear instead.\nThe man in black explains how the valve handle Tanukichi has is the key to a great treasure, They manage to escape, recovering the valve handle, and explore the ruined buildings to find a place where it will fit. They find a valve stem that fits it exactly, and turning it, they find a treasure trove of erotic art that had been hidden from the censorship state. They seal it back up again, hoping that it can be opened in the future when the country is ready for it.",
