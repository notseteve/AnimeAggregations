Meanwhile, Haru is growing worried over Subaru`s unusually long absence... so the moment Hiroto arrives, she bolts out the door to look for him! When Subaru hears this, even the driving rain can`t stop him from rushing to search for her. Nana, Yugo, and Kawase also join in the hunt, but Haru is nowhere to be found... Will Subaru and Haru find each other again?\nSource: crunchyroll",
