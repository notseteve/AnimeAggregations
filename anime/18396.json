  "description" : "After receiving the \"Spiritual Qi Seed\" ceremony, Qiao Sen, the second son of the Qiao family, was inspired by the \"Spiritual Plant\" to develop spiritual skills. In the process, Qiao Sen successively met the pharmacist Tian Biyao, the daughter of the family elder, Huo Bingli, the young killer of the Black Dragon Society, and Feng Wuyang, the eldest lady of the Feng family. At the same time, Qiao Sen collected spiritual stones, opened spiritual veins, expanded more spiritual plants, showed extraordinary potential, and became a patrol officer of the six gates of Jianshan City. After experiencing life and death together, Qiao Sen and Tian Biyao exchanged secrets and helped Bing Li regain her life and escape from the Black Dragon Society, attracting Feng Wuyang`s attention. For this reason, he has fought against Black Dragon Society killers many times, and has seen how domineering even low-level disciples of evil sects and other major sects can be. As a secret patrolman, Qiao Sen quickly accumulated spiritual stones, increased his cultivation speed, and enlightened more spiritual plants. At this time, Qiao Sen`s qualifications attracted the attention of mysterious forces. Monks from Vajra Temple came to visit, Taoists from Zhenwu Sect invited him, and people from evil sects such as Mahakala and Blood Knife Sect also came. Qiao Sen later learned that the black spiritual species and the ancient lost sect \"Shangqing\", and the evil force Black Dragon Society wanted to obtain the treasure and dominate the world. While pursuing clues, Qiao Sen and Bing Li fought side by side many times, turning from enemies to friends and then lovers. At the same time, Qiao Sen felt that Tian Biyao, who took care of him like a sister, was actually secretly in love. To this end, the three of them embark on a journey together to prevent the Black Dragon Society from obtaining the ruins of the Shangqing Immortal Sect and dominating the world.\nsource: bgm.tv/googletranslate",
