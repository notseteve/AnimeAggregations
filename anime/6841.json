  "description" : "Animals gather to compete in Olympic games. This animation was inspired by the 1928 Olympic Games held in Amsterdam.\nAnimals appear in a field all holding a lion flag in their hands. Following the opening address from the chairman lion, a monkey representing all the animals declares that they all will demonstrate the spirit of sportsbeastship (as opposed to sportsmanship). When the games start, a monkey who was filming a polar bear failing in an attempt at the pole vault tries it himself and successfully obtains a high mark. In the discus, a throw by an elephant flies over the mountains. In the 200-meter hurdles event for a black rabbit and pig, the rabbit wins, but the pig inflates like a balloon and flies off into the sky. In the javelin, the throw by the elephant follows the pig, hits it, and the pig lands. A camel, hippopotamus, bulldog, duck, and monkey are in the 1500-meter final. The bulldog was leading the race but fights with the monkey in the middle of the race and goes out of his lane, giving the lead to the duck. A trophy is given to the elephant who won first prize in his two events, and everyone tossed the elephant in the air celebrating his victory, but the trophy is smashed to pieces when the elephant falls down on it.\nSource: National Film Archive of Japan",
