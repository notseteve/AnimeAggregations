Now, he enjoys a peaceful and carefree life as a resident adventurer of the Komai Village. One day, during a quest, he ventured into a dungeon and finds a young girl being partially eaten by a weakest kind of monster, a slime! The girl`s name was http://anidb.net/ch148538 [Rirui]. Having been abandoned by her parents, she had no place to go and entered the dungeon alone in order to stay alive.
