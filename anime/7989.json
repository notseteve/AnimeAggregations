  "description" : "* Based on http://anidb.net/cr6287 [Bushiroad]`s Collectible Card Game by the same name.\nThe protagonist of this story, Sendo Aichi, is a timid boy in his third year of middle school. He had been living his life looking backward rather than forward, trying not to stand out. However, he had one thing that kept him going - the Blaster Blade, a card from a card game that was given to him when he was little. That card is the reason why he begins to engage in Card Fights, something that changes his life drastically.\nThe name of the card game is Vanguard. The game takes place in a different planet called Klay, and due to a never before seen play system, it becomes popular throughout the world.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch25900 [Aichi], immediately attracted by Vanguard, meets friends such as http://anidb.net/ch25902 [Togura Misaki] and http://anidb.net/ch25903 [Katsuragi Kamui], along with other rivals. Through friendly rivalry with them, Aichi begins to enjoy a fulfilling life. Aichi, however, has a goal: to once again battle with a Vanguard Fighter by the name of http://anidb.net/ch25901 [Kai Toshiki]. Kai is an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities in the world of Vanguard. He is also the reason why Aichi started playing the game. For him, Toshiki is the person who saved him from his boring life and introduced him to Vanguard. In order to get better at Vanguard, Aichi puts his soul into it every day. He wishes that someday, he will be able to battle Toshiki and have him recognise his worth.\nSource: CrunchyRoll",
