Shana does not believe him and the three Flame Hazes fight with Yuji. He traps Wilhelmina and Margery in a ball of silver. Yuji explains to Margery that the Silver is a projection of her emotions. He is a mirror of her hate towards everyone who abused her and has done the things Margery secretly wanted to do to them on her behalf. She has a mental breakdown and starts hysterically crying. Meanwhile, Yuji is chasing Shana and they fight. In the end, he captures her and goes to the Haridan with Shana unconscious in his arms. He takes the Haridan and claims it is his property. Yuji reveals to Yoshida, after she asks him, that he returned her letter back to let her know he chose Shana. She then falls on her knees in shock.

His partner, the Scatterer of Sparkling Light, Rebecca Reed, frees Keisaku and sends him back to Margery Daw with Wilhelmina`s reports. Rebecca flies to Wilhelmina, who has been her ally for a long time, and Sophie Sawallisch makes Emest the commander of the Tokyo Outlaw Headquarters. Meanwhile, at the Serei-den, Shana wonders why she couldn`t do anything against Yuji and why she was so scared when he tried to catch her. She remembers when her trainer, Shiro, told her that one day she will find the greatest power that can bring down anyone and anything and then he asks to her to hold his hand. Shana then remembers how every enemy she fought, held hands with someone and she recognizes the greatest power of love that lies on the palm of Yuji`s hand. Suddenly, there`s a loud noise and when Shana goes out, she sees dead bodies and above them - the Master Throne, Hecate. She responds that Shana is no longer needed.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Only Shana, Yuji, Sydonay, Margery and Kazumi stay behind when the spell on Misaki City is lifted and the city starts moving again. Yuji reveals to the others that there is no duplicate of Misaki City in Xanadu, as he was unable to recreate it due to the role the city played in Xanadu`s creation. Yuji asks Shana for Yukari Hirai`s torch so he can restore her to existence. Shana refuses to agree with Yuji`s intentions to leave her behind in astonishment and starts fighting him, while Margery goes full force against Sydonay. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana`s feelings and Sydonay is killed, fulfilling his wish to rejoin Hecate in spirit. When Yuji and Shana kiss, the spell left by Lamis activates and Yuji becomes a real existence, no longer a Torch. Life returns to normal at Misaki City, including Yukari Hirai being restored, and Kantaro and Chigusa`s child (Miyu Sakai) is born. Yuji and Shana depart for Xanadu together.\nSource: Wiki",
