  "description" : "Not even a hero, http://anidb.net/ch140653 [Takumi Iruma] gets accidentally mixed in with a group of heroes chosen to be summoned to another world. As compensation for the mix-up, http://anidb.net/ch140655 [a goddess] offers him the right to choose any skill he wishes for! Hoping for a peaceful and quiet life that has nothing to do with fighting or going into battle, he chooses a seemingly boring creation skill. However, it turns out \"alchemy\" is the most powerful skill that allows him to create everything from a holy sword to flying ships! This cheat skill he unexpectedly acquired turns him into a wealthy merchant and makes him undefeatable in battles!\nSource: Alpha Manga",
