Hagu refuses, stating she won`t be lonely because she now has friends, which is a stark contrast to Professor Hanamoto`s recollection of Hagu`s life prior to coming to the art school. Meanwhile, Mayama bids Rika farewell when she learns he has been hired and started working at the Fujiwara Design Office, promising he would return some day. Before Professor Hanamoto`s farewell party, Hagu tries to find a four-leaf clover to give Professor Hanamoto as a good luck charm, to which everyone coincidentally passes by and helps out to find. Ultimately, they are unsuccessful, although Professor Hanamoto`s appreciates the effort and Takemoto cherishes the memory of that day.\nSource: Wikipedia",

It`s shown to humorous effect that Hagu and Professor Hanamoto greatly miss each other. After dinner, Mayama asks why they are gathered together, and no one seems to know. Takemoto replies that it`s his birthday, and everyone is very embarrassed. They all attempt to make up for it. Morita makes a Twister mat and cards with too many colors, and he and Takemoto become hopelessly entangled in it. Morita makes a joke about Mayama`s stalking, and Mayama leaves. Yamada sees him off. After Mayama has left, Yamada looks up at the sky and wonders how to give up on Mayama, and whether it`s worth it. Mayama, meanwhile, sits and stares at Rika`s window. The next day, Yamada has to leave Hagu alone in the apartment for a night. Takemoto remembers that he made it through his first night alone because of his friends, so he goes to visit Hagu. The two sit and talk late into the night.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Morita suddenly appears in his eccentric behavior, giving her his scarf and kissing her unconsciously. He ran away the moment he realized what he had just done. Hagu was quite shocked after that and she got a fever which, according to Professor Hanamoto, is often caused to her by stress. Professor Hanamoto told Takemoto about Hagu`s uncomfortable feelings while going out with Morita last time, and he said she did not realize that was because she liked him. Takemoto, feeling depressed, comes back home, finding the person responsible for summoning Morita to work, who is seen breaking into Morita`s overly secured room. The room shockingly resembled that of a master control room. This mysterious person then finds Morita`s passport, in order to be delivered to the airport. He then tells Takemoto that Morita is about to go to Los Angeles for six months for a job. Takemoto jumps into the car with him to go to airport but he could not make it in time to bid Morita farewell. The person is later revealed to be Morita`s older brother, Kaoru Morita, who also portrays eccentricity. Takemoto asks Kaoru whether Morita will return or not. In turn, Kaoru asks Takemoto whether or not he wants Morita to return.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Meanwhile, at the Fujiwara Design Office, Yamazaki and Miwako talk with Morita and Mayama about Nomiya. Miwako explains to Mayama that he and Nomiya are alike in personality, which makes Mayama frustrated. Nomiya and Yamada bought food at a pastry shop. Nomiya brings her to the sight of a Ferris wheel at his place, while Yamada reminisces over her time with Mayama in the Ferris wheel. Yamada then admits that Nomiya was right about her relationship with Mayama, causing her to cry. The next morning, Yamada is shocked to have slept overnight with Nomiya, but Nomiya calms her down by offering her a ride on the Ferris wheel. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Later on, Morita meets up with Mayama, and Morita tells Mayama that he wants to visit the office again sometime. Mayama views pictures of Ferris wheels taken by Nomiya, noticing how much Ferris wheels meant to Nomiya. Morita finds Yamada, having great concern over her. Morita then walks her to her house. The next day, Professor Hanamoto explains to Takemoto how he became a teacher. Takemoto then tells Professor Hanamoto that everyone except him has their future planned out, including Hagu. Morita becomes surprised that Hagu doesn`t want her paintings to be displayed and shown in museums and art galleries. Professor Hanamoto tells Morita that it is up to Hagu to do what she wants with her art, but Professor Hanamoto questions himself if that is the right thing to do. At the office, Yamazaki and Miwako accuses Nomiya of having a perverted personality. However, Nomiya recalls that he was trying to change his ways until Mayama started working at the office, since Mayama had the same personality as him. Yamada is seen by Professor Shōda, making pottery. She had made too much pottery, which Professor Shōda realized that something was troubling her. \nSource: Wikipedia",
