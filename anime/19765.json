  "description" : "* Based on a psychic action battle manga by http://anidb.net/cr84262 [Iwashiro Toshiaki], originally serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump (published by Shueisha) from 2008 to 2010.\nOne day, high schooler http://anidb.net/ch152614 [Yoshina Ageha] picks up a mysterious \"red phone card\" left behind in a public telephone booth. A few days later, his childhood friend and classmate, http://anidb.net/ch152615 [Amamiya Sakurako]—who possessed the same card—suddenly vanishes without a trace. In search of her, Ageha finds himself drawn into the rumors surrounding a nationwide string of mysterious disappearances, said to be the work of a secret organization known only as \"Psyren.\" When he accesses the group, a deadly game begins—one that will change his fate forever.\nSource: Official Website",
