  "description" : "On a summer day, father and son ants are carrying a large caterpillar. An old toad, already drunk in the daytime, teases the ants for their hard work. A young grasshopper and a butterfly are having a sumptuous meal while listening to music. Watching the ants dragging the caterpillar, the grasshopper and the butterfly mock the ants with grimaces. The ants take rest at home. While a daughter ant is busy washing a kimono, the grasshopper plays a banjo, with the butterfly dancing to the music on a table. The father ant admonishes his son, who envies the grasshopper and the butterfly, quoting a proverb, \"Summer fun leads to a winter of misery.\" The summer gives way to autumn and then comes winter, when cold breezes blow. The ant family is spending time together in a warm home. The son ant beats the father in arm wrestling. The grasshopper, wearing ragged clothes and walking with a cane, begs for food through the window. The daughter ant says that the butterfly is bedridden. The old toad is also seriously ill. The father ant quotes the proverb once again: \"Summer fun leads to a winter of misery.\"\nSource: National Film Archive of Japan",
