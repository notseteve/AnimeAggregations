It is assumed by the count that Velveno is there to steal the valuable Balsamico family ring. The Fairy Tail members fail to capture him before he obtains the ring, but he instead uses it to propose to Aceto as he is in love with her. Aceto accepts his proposal on the condition that he turn himself in for his crimes, which he does, though it costs Fairy Tail their reward for the job.",
