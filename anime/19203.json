  "description" : "* Based on an occult fantasy battle manga by http://anidb.net/cr80405 [Takaki Tsuyoshi].\nAzuma Jirou is not your average high schooler. Hailing from a long line of ninja, Jirou has been brought up by his grandfather in the ancient warrior art of the shinobi. Jirou also happens to be a particularly skilled communicator able to converse with the animal world. But life takes an abrupt turn thanks to a mysterious encounter in the forest with an injured black cat named Ragou.\nOnly, Ragou`s feline appearance is deceiving... It turns out the \"ordinary\" cat is the stuff of mononoke legend–the Black Star of Doom!\nSwarming in the shadows are more mononoke, eager to exploit Ragou`s uniquely immense powers. To fight back against the tide of dark spirits, the undercover Bureau of Espionage is poised to seek and destroy. Of course, everyone has their motives when it comes to Ragou`s powers. But Jirou and Ragou are ready.\nSource: Official Website",
