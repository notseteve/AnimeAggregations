This \"Angel of Death\" has a name: http://anidb.net/ch94423 [Boogiepop]. And the legends are true. Boogiepop is real.\nWhen a rash of disappearances involving female students breaks out at Shinyo Academy, the police and faculty assume they just have a bunch of runaways on their hands. Yet some students know better. Something mysterious and foul is afoot. Is it Boogiepop or something even more sinister?\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
