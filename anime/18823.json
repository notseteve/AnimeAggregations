  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch148319 [Kotani Kaboku] is starting high school, and he plans to do what he`s always done: go along with his friends, keep quiet, and not to draw too much attention to himself. After all, it`s hard enough to get by with a stutter like his—why make things worse by standing out from the crowd? But then he sees another first-year, http://anidb.net/ch148320 [Wanda Hikari], dancing like no one is watching—or like she doesn`t care who sees her. It makes Kaboku wonder: Could he reach that same freedom? To find his way to Wanda, he does something he never thought he could: He joins the dance club. After all, every routine begins with a single step, right?\nSource: Kodansha",
