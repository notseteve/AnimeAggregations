  "description" : "* Based on a series of light novels written by http://anidb.net/cr5970 [Nishio Ishin] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr6436 [Vofan].\nDuring October of his third year in high school, http://anidb.net/ch8962 [Araragi Koyomi] is introduced to a transfer student named http://anidb.net/ch58986 [Oshino Ougi] by his underclassman http://anidb.net/ch8966 [Kanbaru Suruga]. Ougi wants to ask Koyomi`s opinion on a strange discovery of hers. She draws him a map of Naoetsu High School and, judging by it, there seems to be something wrong with the building`s floor plan. This observation as the starting point, a tale never meant to be told begins to emerge changing Koyomi`s high school life forever. It is a story that reveals what made Araragi Koyomi who he is now. It is a story that reveals how it all began.\n— adapted from Crunchyroll",

      "description" : "Koyomi finds himself trapped in a phantom classroom with Oshino Ougi, apparently stuck there with time frozen due to the effects of another Oddity. Ougi determines that they are trapped there because of a similar incident that happened two years ago, when Koyomi was a high school freshman, and marked a turning point in his life. He recounts the incident, which involved an alleged leakage of the answers to a maths exam during a study session, and how a classmate of his, Oikura Sodachi, was determined to find the culprit. Among the suspects are those who scored highest, which included Koyomi and Sodachi themselves, and the argument is heated until the matter is put to a vote, and Sodachi is herself chosen as the culprit. She never came to school again since. Koyomi however, personally believed that it was their maths and homeroom teacher Tetsujou Komichi who was responsible, adjusting enough of the questions in her own exam to match the study session. That she herself voted for Sodachi made him lose faith in people and made him ever more withdrawn and cynical since. This allows Koyomi to leave the classroom.\nThe next day, Koyomi comes to class, and is warned by Hanekawa not to enter the classroom, as Sodachi has suddenly returned to school.",

She winds up stabbing him in the hand with a pencil just as Hitagi comes in, although Hanekawa is tying to stop her, and the two have a fight.\nLater, Ougi accompanies him to his former middle school, and they go to his old shoe locker, which contains envelopes with his name on them. One of the envelopes contains a map, which leads to a dilapidated old house where Koyomi remembers that he explored regularly every summer during middle school, and where he met a girl.",

      "description" : "Koyomi recounts to Ougi how he had originally found similar letters in his shoe locker when he was in his first year of middle school, and how they intrigued him. He came to the house and the girl explained how she had sent similar letters to others and how he was the only one who responded. She began helping him study maths and this helped him to become as good at it as he eventually became, and was critical to him getting into Naoetsu High School three years later. She imposed three conditions on him that they should always meet only in the house, to keep the study sessions a secret, and that he should not probe into her life.\nOn the last day of summer vacation Koyomi went to the house as before and found it empty. He found an empty envelope taped to the bottom of their study table. He never saw the girl again. He tried looking for her at school to no avail. Ougi concludes that the mystery girl must be Sodachi, although he is perplexed at why she would not have reminded him of their former acquaintance when they later became classmates in high school.\nOugi explains that the reason why Sodachi invited him over for their study sessions was because her family was experiencing domestic violence and that she knew that Koyomi`s parents were police officers, and she hoped he and his parents might be able to help her family. His middle school self, however, was not able to understand this and her family eventually fell apart completely by the end of that summer.\nThe next day he shares Ougi`s conclusions with Hanekawa, who points out Ougi`s conclusion hinges Sodachi knowing that Koyomi`s parents were police officers, a fact which Koyomi generally keeps secret to avoid problems. He realises that his relationship with Sodachi must go further yet and there is more he still needs to remember.",
