  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr55607 [Baba Okina] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr55608 [Kiryuu Tsukasa].\nIn another world, the Hero and the Demon King continued to oppose each other. As their great magic collided, the explosion crossed over worlds and destroyed a classroom full of high school students. The victims who died in that explosion will be reincarnated in that alternate world. Our heroine, who has the lowest standing in the class, was reincarnated into a spider. She nevertheless faces this challenge head-on with great determination, and adapts to it surprisingly quickly. This is the story of how our protagonist, who was reborn as a weak spider monster, does whatever needed to survive.\nSource: M-U",
