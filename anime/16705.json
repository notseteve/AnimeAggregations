  "description" : "It is the year 2062, two decades after the failure of a massive workforce automation project. However, Artemis, the artificial intelligence at the core of that project, had decided to attack humanity, and the resulting war laid waste to Earth.\nA lone girl, http://anidb.net/ch11472 [Empress], wakes up in an underground laboratory at a base. She is one of three surviving guardians of humanity. However, she has no memories of what came before. All she knows is what http://anidb.net/ch122100 [a colonel] of the peace-building force tells her.\nArtemis is constructing a space elevator to link the Moon and Earth, and Empress is ordered to destroy the space elevator before its completion. If the elevator is completed, the hordes of giant mechanized forces being mass-produced on the Moon will descend upon Earth.\nHowever, standing in the way of Empress are her supposed allies http://anidb.net/ch15711 [Dead Master] and http://anidb.net/ch20088 [Strength], as well as the unmanned pawn forces of Artemis, Smiley of the \"Educational Institution\" cult, and more.\nEmpress makes her advance towards the space elevator with the colonel and others. What awaits them there...\nSource: Official site, translated",
