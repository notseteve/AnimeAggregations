  "description" : "This TV series is about a boy named Sharaku who is an innocent child when the third eye on his forehead is covered with a patch. But once the patch comes off, he is transformed into a member of the evil three-eyed tribe, who possesses supernatural powers and had once built an ancient civilization. While the original Manga included Tezuka Osamu`s studies on highly sophisticated ancient civilizations and a great number of sexual scenes involving Wato, the partner of Sharaku, these elements were subdued for the TV version in consideration of a younger audience. This was the first animated work based on Tezuka Osamu`s Manga that was planned following his death.\nSource: official homepage",
