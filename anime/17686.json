  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch135961 [Zagan] is feared by the masses as an evil sorcerer. Both socially awkward and foulmouthed, he spends his days studying sorcery while beating down any trespassers within his domain. One day he`s invited to a dark auction, and what he finds there is an elven slave girl of peerless beauty, http://anidb.net/ch135962 [Nephy]. Having fallen in love at first sight, Zagan uses up his entire fortune to purchase her, but being a poor conversationalist, he has no idea how to properly interact with her. Thus, the awkward cohabitation of a sorcerer who has no idea how to convey his love and his slave who yearns for her master but has no idea how to appeal to him begins.\nSource: J-Novel",
