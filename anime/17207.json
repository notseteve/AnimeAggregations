  "description" : "Tom Sawyer Island is a city with strictly controlled information. The residents of this island use a visual information device called DECO (Decoration Customizer) to go back and forth between the Super Reproduction Space and virtual space. There is a numerical social credit system among the residents measured in units called \"love\". The amount of \"love\" one gets determines a resident`s social standing, and this system is the reason for their peaceful society. Collecting a lot of \"love\" allows residents to expand their DECO capabilities, so residents scramble daily to collect as much as they can. On Tom Sawyer Island rumors spread of a Phantom ZERO, rumored to be causing a ZERO phenomenon in which \"love\" is lost. One day, a girl named http://anidb.net/ch122920 [Berry] gets caught up investigating the mysterious Zero phenomenon of lost \"love\", and ends up becoming an invisible being called YUREI. Berry then meets another YUREI and a genius hacker named http://anidb.net/ch122919 [Hack], and joins the Ghost Detective Club. As Berry works to solve cases at the Ghost Detective Club, she becomes closer to uncovering the truths hidden on Tom Sawyer Island.\nSource: Official Website",
