The story goes like this: Hyakkimaru was born without arms and legs, like a caterpillar, but a doctor named Juko supplied him with artificial limbs and glass eyes so that he could manage to survive. Hyakkimaru, however, was always followed by demons. They were drawn to him, probably because he should have been dead with such a body. Being in Hyakkimaru`s company therefore meant being constantly scared of demons. Hearing the story, however, Dororo replies that she finds it \"interesting.\" Hyakkimaru continues on his journey, believing the mysterious voice that tells him, \"If you kill 48 devils, you will have a complete body.\" At a temple that was burned down during the war, he meets a girl called Mio, who is taking care of orphans. Her gentleness touches him and his mind is calmed for the first time in his life, but warriors break into the temple and kill Mio and the orphans.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",

Gorobei boasts that he does not believe in monsters and demons, but as long as he is with Hyakkimaru, demons are drawn to them. Soon after they enter a deserted village, a ghostly air engulfs them. Then weird things begin to happen. Blood drips from the ceiling, furniture moves on its own, houses suddenly collapse, and cats and crows are manipulated by demons. Gorobei is scared not of these weird incidents but of Hyakkimaru, who challenges monsters as a matter of course.\nSource: tezukaosamu.net",
