  "description" : "Humanity lived quietly behind massive walls built to protect themselves from the threat of monstrous creatures called Titans. Their century of peace was shattered by an attack on their city that left a young child, Eren Yeager, motherless and vowing revenge on the titans. Years after joining the Survey Corps, Eren finds himself facing a deadly foe, and ultimately gaining a special ability that unveils a new truth about the world he knows... After venturing beyond the walls and separated from his comrades, Eren finds himself inspired by this new truth and plots the \"Rumbling,\" a terrifying plan to eradicate every living thing in the world. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, a motley crew of Eren`s former comrades and enemies scramble to halt his deadly mission. The only question is, can they stop him?\nSource: Crunchyroll",
