  "description" : "Only three people remain of the Borgman project: Chuck Sweager, Ryo Hibiki, and Anice Farm. The adjustment to a moderately normal, everyday existence is not necessarily easy, but they`ve all done their best. Three years have passed, and all three of them have settled into jobs where they can be content, if not wholly happy and satisfied.\nThree years have passed, and Chuck has continued his relationship with police woman Miki Katsura. He himself has joined the police force as a special investigator. And soon he and Miki have some serious investigating to do. Someone somewhere has begun developing new cyborgs...a notable accomplishment since the methods used by Memory in the Borgman project were years ahead of her time and supposedly died with her. But what else can these people be? Ordinary people can`t pick up cars and throw them around like baseballs. Ordinary people can`t be buried by a collapsing building yet emerge from the rubble relatively unscathed. And ordinary people certainly can`t jump in excess of ten metres in a single bound. So they must be cyborgs, right? But who`s making them, and why?\nRyo and Anice, meanwhile, have settled in Florida, where Ryo has joined the workforce constructing a new rocket. Anice, since she can`t contribute much to the project, became a waitress at a coffeeshop, but she`s becoming increasingly discontent with her life. So it`s understandable when a letter arrives offering her a job back in Tokyo where she can be useful. She shares the news with Ryo, begging him to come back to Japan with her, but he says that he can`t go now, not when the rocket launch is only days away. She leaves alone, and back in Japan hooks up with Chuck and Miki, who ask her to help investigate Heaven`s Gate, an energy project that seems to be the center of a rash of disappearances from all around Tokyo Bay. She does so, but Heaven`s Gate is definitely more than it seems. Now, can Ryo and Chuck arrive in time to save Anice, and will they even stand a chance against a new breed of cyborgs?\nNote: The OVA received a theatrical release starting on 16.09.1989.",
