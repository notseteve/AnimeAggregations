In its zeal to stamp out any remaining opposition, the http://anidb.net/ch2441 [Earth Federation] has organized the http://anidb.net/ch2733 [Titans], an elite fighting force. However, the Titans soon get out of hand, committing atrocities on par with the worst the http://anidb.net/ch2422 [Principality of Zeon] had to offer during the war. In response, dissatisified citizens, former Zeon soldiers, and even members of the http://anidb.net/ch2452 [Earth Federation Forces] form a resistance group known as the Anti-Earth Union Group, or http://anidb.net/ch117762 [AEUG]. As the next war is brewing, a small AEUG group arrives at Side 7 to investigate the new http://anidb.net/ch6659 [Gundam Mk. II]...",
