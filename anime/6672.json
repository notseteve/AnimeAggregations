So he decides to start working part-time there, to be close to her. But Sayoko is not your regular girl; she claims to be a ghost possessing him. And as it turns out all his co-workers have a mysterious secret of their own as well...\nAs the days go by for Hajime, the recent additions to the Hakobune Café staff: http://anidb.net/ch5469 [Fushimi Yayoi] and http://anidb.net/ch5468 [Yamazaki Kanako] — both ghosts from the same era as Arashi and http://anidb.net/ch5465 [Kaya] — feel right at home, adding spice to the already unusual daily happenings at the café. Hajime`s happy days spent with Sayoko take a dampener though, when he finds out that she will apparently disappear at the end of summer...",

Arashi asked Hajime if anything happened, though Hajime does not recall doing anything. Kaya was actually trying to find a moment to get back at Hajime for making her drink the “Cutie Cherry Fruit Juice.” Kaya starts making something with the Kiwis that Sunglasses brought in, but Hajime and Arashi follow in taking strange actions.\nSource: crunchyroll",
