  "description" : "Norl`s a cutting-edge cutie with a cutting edge who`s a cut above the rest. Heihachi`s just your average mobile game addict with a whale-sized hole in his wallet. But one day, he pulls an item that pulls him into another world, spinning his life around with a spin of the gacha. Attacked by monsters, and left without options, Heihachi does what he knows best—roll gacha! To his surprise, he watches his unit materialize before his eyes. Heihachi`s used to seeing cute girls pop up on his phone, but he`s never seen one pop out of his phone!\nSource: Kaiten Books",
