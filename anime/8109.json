He rushes to the airport, boards the plane, and as he expected the plane is hijacked by the Butei Killer, who turns out to be none other than Riko herself. She reveals that she is the fourth lineal descendant of Arsène Lupin, the famed master thief, just as Aria is the fourth descendant of his arch-nemesis Sherlock Holmes, and that she staged all of the Butei Killer incidents and tried to bring Kinji and Aria together, so that she could prove that she was better than her famous ancestor.

At the villa, they see the popular teacher Sayonaki, who is supposedly staying at the house doing his research with the owner`s permission.\nThey remain at the villa for two weeks, eventually discovering the precise location of Riko`s rosary which is under heavy security, and Sayonaki`s behaviour seems very suspicious. At the end of the two weeks Riko has them move, with Aria distracting Sayonaki as Kinji goes down into the underground storage room to take the rosary. Riko cuts Aria off from their radio link and speaks to him seductively in Aria`s voice, which activates his Hysteria Mode, and that allows him to steal the rosary just before Aria and Sayonaki return. After they deliver the rosary back to Riko, she double-crosses them, saying that she used them to retrieve it and now will defeat them both.",

      "description" : "Just as Riko is getting ready to fight Aria and Kinji, she is tased from behind by Sayonaki, who turns out to not only be a scientist working on a eugenic programme of which Riko had been a part, but actually Vlad himself, as her despair makes him transform into his monster form. Aria and Kinji find themselves in an impossible position as their bullets fail to harm Vlad, as they do not know where his fourth weak spot is. Kinji attempts to get Riko away before returning to the battle, and she tells him that she believes his fourth weak spot is in his chest. They try to do this, but it does not work, and Kinji`s Hysteria Mode wears off, but not before he notices something important. He nearly falls off the building in Vlad`s counter-attack, but Riko manages to save him using her parachute-dress, and they circle around and pick up Aria. Between them they have four guns with one shot each. Kinji lands with his face on Aria`s chest and this restores his Hysteria Mode, and they attack Vlad one last time. Kinji noticed how Vlad attempted to protect his mouth the last time they shot at him, and he correctly deduced that was where his fourth weak spot was, and that way they manage to kill him.\nAfterwards, Riko makes her escape, but keeps her promise to testify on Aria`s mother`s behalf.",
