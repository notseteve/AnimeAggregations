  "description" : "In the 23rd century, a hidden group called Shadow is taking over the world. To fight against Shadow, billionaire Midoriyama Rei creates a secret organization called Circus. When she can`t find qualified pilots for Circus` main mecha, the Galvion, she cuts a deal with two convicts, Mu and Maya: they must lead the fight against Shadow and save innocents in exchange for years being cut from their long prison sentences.\nSource: Wikipedia\nNote: The show did not fare very well and had its planned number of episodes cut. A 23rd episode, then already partially completed, was never aired, and episode 22 had a 35-second epilogue tacked onto the end that explained the series` planned outcome via voice-over narration and stills.",
