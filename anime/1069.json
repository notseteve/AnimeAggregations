  "description" : "It begins with a tournament, organized as a birthday present for Dollar Money, the son of Gyusan Money, the richest man in the world. The combatants are to fight simultaneously, until there are only four contestants left. At this point, the remaining four were to fight four \"aliens\", and whoever finished first was to fight Mr. Satan for the grand prize. The first half of the movie is mainly comedy, with Gohan, Mirai no Trunks, and Kuririn fighting their way through the tournament, becoming three of the four finalists. All the while Goku is watching his son from heaven, and Mr. Satan is engaged in his usual antics in trying to get away from \"Those people!\" The second half begins when, in the final rounds, the four \"Aliens\" have most obviously been replaced with REAL aliens- led by one named Bojack. Bojack had apparently tried to fight the gods some time ago, and was imprisoned in a star. Kaiou`s death during the Cell game freed him, and he was trying to get special revenge on the North Kaiou by taking his student`s planet first. Trunks defeats his opponent, but loses to Bojack, while Kuririn and Daisuke both lose to theirs- at the cost of Daisuke`s life. Gohan doesn`t finish his fight before all of the villains convene and introduce themselves, thus spawning one of the finest one-sided movie fight scenes yet, which lasts until everyone is trashed and Gohan is being crushed to death by Bojack. Goku, breaking the afterlife rules, teleports out of heaven in an effort to save Gohan. Gohan then goes SSJ2 and kills two out of the three henchmen, and Gohan then kills Bojack. The movie ends with everybody recovering in the hospital, a typical happy movie ending.\nNote: Screened as a triple feature with http://anidb.net/a1084 [Yuu Yuu Hakusho (1993)] and http://anidb.net/a6624 [Dr. Slump: Arale-chan Ncha!

      "description" : "Warriors from every corner of the galaxy are gathering to battle in the most incredible martial arts tournament ever conceived. Many will test their power and technique. Few will make it to the finals. One will be hailed as the greatest. But before a victor can be crowned, sport gives way to a fight for survival. Bojack - an intergalactic scourge as evil as he is mighty. Leading a gang of deviant criminals, Bojack will stop at nothing short of universal domination. One by one, Earth`s greatest heroes fall. Only young Gohan can stop the wicked invaders - if he can summon the strength within.\nSource: crunchyroll",
