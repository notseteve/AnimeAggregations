  "description" : "Backstabbed by those he considered friends, Dennis has been exiled from one of the strongest guilds around: the Silver Wings Battalion. He doesn`t think much of it, though, as he was dying to use his level 99 cooking skills anyway. That`s why he decides to leave the city behind and open up a diner in the countryside. While pursuing his dream, Dennis meets Atrielle, a girl exiled from her noble household and relegated to slavery until he saves her. The pair open the diner together, and their first client is... an exiled knight from a different guild? How peculiar. But she is not the only customer; a cocky mage and a drastically overworked yet underpaid sage become regulars as well. The knight brings trouble to the diner at times, but Dennis`s cooking skills and beloved butcher knives cut through trouble and hunger alike! Thus begins the legend of Dennis and his diner, the talk of the town!\nSource: Tentai Books",
