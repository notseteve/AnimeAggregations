  "description" : "Some people say that the world is a great sea of suffering. When a person is in the sea, his body is a boat, and his soul is the person in the boat, sailing to the other shore. The Daqian Dynasty was prosperous in the spring and autumn, and the country was prosperous, and the world was honored. However, under the powerful surface, the undercurrent was already surging. The enemies from far and near were staring at each other, and the eight demons were about to move. Monitor the world. In such a world of great controversy, Hong Yi, a young scholar, uttered his first question to the world. Hong Yi is the son of Hong Xuanji, the most powerful official in the dynasty, and Meng Bingyun, the supreme saint of the Taishang Dao. He lost his mother when he was young, and as a bastard, he was bullied everywhere, but this could not stop Hong Yi from studying. By chance and coincidence, Hong Yi embarked on the extremely difficult and dangerous road of both martial arts and martial arts. Under the oppression of fate, he stood up and resisted, defeated many powerful enemies, and became a legend of a generation.\nsource: bgm.tv/DeepL.com",
