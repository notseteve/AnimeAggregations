The crushing blow dealt to the forces under him doesn`t seem to faze Lobos, however, on whose orders the survivors now assemble together in order to strike again. As the remainders of what was once a mighty force over half the entire Alliance Space Fleet are at the very end of their rope, Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch91457 [Yang Wenli] must now fight to save as many of his country`s troops as he possibly can. Moreover, before the current battle is even over, political trouble that will shake the entire galaxy to its core is getting ready to brew...\n— written by Hinoe\nNote: The series was originally screened in theatres from September 2019 to November 2020, while concurrently being streamed on Crunchyroll beginning in September 2019 as TV-length episodes.",

      "description" : "Heinessen has been set free after the failure of the coup d`état, and its people are holding a ceremony to celebrate peace. High Council Chairman Trunicht, who had been sheltered by the Earth Cult during the coup d`état, stirs the ceremony attendees with a clever speech. Yang, displeased with the requirement that he shake hands with Trunicht on the stage in front of everyone, shudders at the thoughts that go through his own head. In the midst of all this, the esteemed Admiral Merkatz of the Imperial Navy pays a visit to Yang with the shocking declaration that he has defected.\nSource: crunchyroll",
