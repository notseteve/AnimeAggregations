The crushing blow dealt to the forces under him doesn`t seem to faze Lobos, however, on whose orders the survivors now assemble together in order to strike again. As the remainders of what was once a mighty force over half the entire Alliance Space Fleet are at the very end of their rope, Vice Admiral http://anidb.net/ch91457 [Yang Wenli] must now fight to save as many of his country`s troops as he possibly can. Moreover, before the current battle is even over, political trouble that will shake the entire galaxy to its core is getting ready to brew...\n— written by Hinoe\nNote: The series was originally screened in theatres from September 2019 to November 2020, while concurrently being streamed on Crunchyroll beginning in September 2019 as TV-length episodes.",
