      "description" : "Taiki, Akari, and Zenjirou have been sent back to the human world, but their families don`t believe their stories of the Digital World. A Digital aura appears in the sky over Tokyo, and soon Taiki hears the same mysterious voice he heard on the day he received his Xros Loader. The voice tells him there is no hope left for the Digital World. Taiki decides to return there with Shoutmon and seeks the owner of the voice for help getting back. He then finds the DigiMemory of a knight who protected the Digital World, the owner of the voice - Omegamon. But before Omegamon can send Taiki back, Tactimon begins to rampage in the human world!\nSource: crunchyroll",
