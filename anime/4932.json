  "description" : "* Based on a novel by http://anidb.net/cr2174 [Nasu Kinoko], writer for http://anidb.net/cr927 [Type-Moon].\nFrom a long sleep, Ryougi Shiki awoke. As an after effect, she gained the power to perceive the death of things. The power to kill anything with just a knife lures Shiki into a dark world: The murderer from two years ago; swarms of floating ghosts; a girl who can bend things by just looking at them; a spiral construction that collects people`s death. When numerous bizarre incidents collides with Shiki`s Mystic Eyes, her lost memories reawaken.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch1297 [Ryougi Shiki] was involved in a car accident and fell into a deep coma for two years. When she finally awoke from it, she had gained the Eyes of Death Perception ability, but believes to have lost something else.\nThe Ryougi family attempted to create human beings that exceeded normal humans, and to accomplish this, they trained their children in various martial arts and fencing, and also made them split their personalities. They believed that by using this method, one personality could be an expert in one subject while the other could be a master of another. Shiki was no exception to this, and she had a masculine and feminine side that could alternately become the dominant personality.\nAfter having woken up from the accident, Shiki believes that her masculine personality has died during the accident, now trying to supplement it by her masculine tone.\nNote: The chronological order of the movies is actually: 2, 4, 3, 1, 5-7. Set in a parallel universe to that of [i]http://anidb.net/a1015 [Shingetsutan Tsukihime]. Considered the precursor/inspiration for the story of Shingetsutan Tsukihime.[/i]",
