  "description" : "Based on \"Jun\" by Shotaro Ishinomori, a manga artist who was said to be difficult to visualize, Art animation with a hand-drawn touch rather than a cel.\nThere is no dialogue, only music and sound effects are used, making it a work that can be conveyed to the heart regardless of age or nationality.\nIn the video, Jun`s episode is superimposed on Ishinomaki City, which is taking steps toward recovery from the sense of loss caused by the earthquake, and through Jun`s growth, artistically expresses the idea that if you don`t give up even in a difficult situation, your dreams will come true.",
