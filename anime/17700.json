  "description" : "* Based on a romantic comedy manga by http://anidb.net/cr69271 [Sakura Roku].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch146819 [Tabata Hana] is a first-year high school student who self-deprecates herself as an ugly girl (busu). She comes to school early morning to do her daily classroom flower exchange. Hana likes this time so much that she takes pleasure in putting a flower on her head, but http://anidb.net/ch146817 [Ueno Yousuke], the most handsome boy in her class who happens to arrive at school early, sees her doing it. Yousuke has always been curious about the person changing the flowers in the classroom, and when he finds out that it is Hana, the two gradually grow closer. However, the distance between Hana, who refuses numerous opportunities for progress, and Yousuke, who is innocent and ignorant when it comes to love, continues to be difficult to close.\nSource: Crunchyroll News",
