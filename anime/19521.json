  "description" : "Reincarnated as a vampire to a noble father and his shunned concubine, Mercedes Grunewald has always known that one day, her father will choose an heir that isn`t her. But what will become of her family when that time comes? Her mother has no skills, their maid is old, and Mercedes is but a small child. How will they survive in the world on their own? Luckily, dungeon crawling is a job that anyone can do—even a child. To provide for her family, Mercedes begins training at the age of a kindergartener, and because she`s from a nation of vampires, she fortunately has the potential to become strong. In her past life, she died unfulfilled, but that won`t be her fate this time. In the dungeons, she`s determined to find something that will make her moon full.\nSource: J-Novel Club",
