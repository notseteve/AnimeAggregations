  "description" : "On a planet very similar to the Earth, the missile mechanoids developed a will of their own, went out of control, and started to pose a serious threat to human beings.\nhttp://anidb.net/ch24787 [Shaleen] is the last ICHIRIN-SHA (unicyclist), travelling the world on his beat-up motorized unicycle. One day, while fleeing from a swarm of missile mechanoids, he stops by a ghost town where he encounters a mysterious strong-willed http://anidb.net/ch65978 [girl] living at a run-down fuel station. As it turns out the missile mechanoids have been trying to hunt her down, and only an energy field bubble around the station has been keeping her safe.\nCertain that the girl is missing some action in her life, he grabs her hand and takes her on a wild unicycle ride...\nNote: Originally meant to be a full-length movie, the project was cancelled, but a 7 minute trailer was released before that.",
