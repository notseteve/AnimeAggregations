  "description" : "* Based on an action fantasy novel by http://anidb.net/cr1963 [Ubukata Tou].\nIn a world of anthropomorphic animals, Belle Lablac was born as the only human being. Having no fangs, fur, or scales, she was called \"Faceless,\" and she lived a lonely life with no one else she could identify with.\n\"I want to be part of the world...\"\nWith such longing in her heart, she decides to set out on a journey to find her roots, carrying the Runding, a great sword as tall as she is. She doesn`t know how many adversities await her along the way...\nSource: Crunchyroll",
