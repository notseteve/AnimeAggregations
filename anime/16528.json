  "description" : "A tourist jet to Antarctica mysteriously went missing. When a search team got to the point where the signal disappeared, they couldn`t find the jet but they were met with a range of mountains unknown to humankind.\nThe unprecedented mountain range, with a height of over 34,000ft above sea level, surpassing Mount Everest, was beyond human comprehension.\nSome daring souls are now attempting to reach that violent mountain. What will they encounter beyond the realm of death?\n[i]This is an animated movie based on \"Mountains of Madness -Summit of Deities-\", a TTRPG scenario that combines the \"Cthulhu Mythos\" & Mountain climbing.\nA crowdfunding campaign was launched in October of 2021 for a full length production and successfully reached the set goal. The pilot film has been released in February 2023 as a first step towards the realization of a full-length feature film.[/i]",
