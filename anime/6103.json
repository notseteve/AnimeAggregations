But one day, Kyoko overhears Shota telling his manager that Kyoko means nothing to him. She`s just convenient, a housekeeper. This makes Kyoko furious, and she vows revenge on Shotaro. But Shotaro just laughs at her, saying she won`t be able to touch him because he`s now a popular singer and she`s a nobody. So Kyoko decides to get into showbiz and become even more popular than Shotaro to humiliate him. Unfortunately, Shotaro has destroyed Kyoko`s ability to love, and she discovers that it is a prerequisite for her to debut from her chosen company, LME.
