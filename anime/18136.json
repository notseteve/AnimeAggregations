  "description" : "This is a 16mm film scan of the animated short film \"Sea Cat,\" a film produced for educational purposes regarding nuclear abolition through the drama of anthropomorphic animals. It conveys a peaceful and anti-nuclear message, and follows the story of the titular Sea Cat, who is raised by a sea otter and encounters a sea monster, which in actuality turns out to be a man-made nuclear submarine. The film was produced by Oh! Productions after securing funding from the Kishiwada City Teachers` Union, apparently as a \"hobby\" film, so it may be rough around the edges here and there when it comes to its story and message. There may be evidence that the film may have been broadcast on television before, but there supposedly exists no home release of it whatsoever, even VHS, so this is the first time it`s being made available to the public on a wider scale aside from occasional film screenings in Japan.",
