A high-frequency resonance is suddenly heard in a suburban area, and at the same time, the entire town is shrouded in a red mist.

About six months later, all the people who had lost consciousness awaken as if nothing ever happened. However, strange incidents start happening on that same day, and the city becomes engulfed by a chain of cruel destinies.\nSource: crunchyroll",
