Suou`s main rival, http://anidb.net/ch115012 [Soshizaki Midori], invites her to join up on the same team in high school, with a promise that she`ll never let Suou \"play alone.\" It`s an earnest offer, but the question is whether Suou will take her up on it.

      "description" : "The Warabis close in on Urawa Hosei`s goal with an attack focused around Nozomi, but at the last second, they fail to score the first point of the game. As both teams struggle for dominance, Urawa Hosei takes advantage of a split-second opportunity, and their eccentric forward Alice Adatara scores the first point. The Warabis attempt to even the score, while Urawa Hosei`s attacks centered around forwards Tenma and Adatara continue.\nSource: crunchyroll",

      "description" : "The Warabis are defeated by Urawa Hosei in the first round of the knockout stages. The next day, Nozomi finds herself unable to sort out her feelings, so she heads to the goal by herself. When Fukatsu stops by, she shares her feelings with him. Even after he tells her that she doesn`t need to change, she still has doubts. The Warabis gather at the practice pitch one by one, and together they attempt to make a fresh start with the desire to become stronger in their hearts.\nSource: crunchyroll",
