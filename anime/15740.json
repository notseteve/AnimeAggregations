  "description" : "Tokyo became anarchy due to a \"power outage\" and was isolated from the world. The remaining people had to protect themselves from the mob. It was the young people who were born with the power outage and had special abilities connected to the power of God called \"Links\" that saved the people of Tokyo. Eventually, a performance group called \"Crown\" in Links gained tremendous support, especially from young people.\nHallelujah, the main character who grew up in an orphanage, and Akatsuki, a close friend, also awaken to the abilities of Lynx and play an active part for people every day as members of the \"crown\". However, there is a growing conflict within the \"crown\" over the government`s plans for the new Parliament building, which is about to be built in the stranded Tokyo, and how to use the abilities they have acquired.\nSource: Official website & Google Translate\nNote: this anime gives viewers the choice of selecting their preferred ending after watching the initial story; viewers can choose the Henkaku no Kyounetsu route or the Ketsui no Yoake route.",
