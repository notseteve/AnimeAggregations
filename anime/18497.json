  "description" : "Satou Konoha has a dark history. After all, she spent her teen years writing self-indulgent fantasy romance fics-like her Dark History. But since she`s become its most despicable villainess, remembering every last detail is now a matter of life-and-death. Having avoided the first couple of death flags, Satou`s suddenly left in the dark when a mysterious stranger returns from the Lily Kingdom-a character she doesn`t recall writing in the original script. Although Yomi claims to be her ally, can Satou really trust a character she knows nothing about in such a dangerous world?\nSource: Yen Press",
