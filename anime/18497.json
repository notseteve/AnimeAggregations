  "description" : "Satou Konoha has a dark history. After all, she spent her teen years writing self-indulgent fantasy romance fics-like her Dark History. But since she`s become its most despicable villainess, remembering every last detail is now a matter of life-and-death. Having avoided the first couple of death flags, Satou`s suddenly left in the dark when a mysterious stranger returns from the Lily Kingdom-a character she doesn`t recall writing in the original script. Although Yomi claims to be her ally, can Satou really trust a character she knows nothing about in such a dangerous world?\nSource: Yen Press\nNote: The first two episodes received an early screening at a special event on 7 September 2025 at TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Tokyo. The regular TV broadcast started on 9 October 2025.",
