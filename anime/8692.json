      "description" : "The VRMMORPG, Sword Art Online (SAO), is officially released, with 10,000 copies released and sold immediately. Kirito, who beta-tested the game, logs-in to the world of Aincrad and meets Klein, a new player, who asks him to teach him the basics of the game including the Sword Skill battle system. Later, after several hours in the game, Kirito and Klein discover that they cannot \"log-out\". Shortly after, the pair are teleported to the town square, where they see that all other players have also been transported to the location. A red-hooded Game Master then appears in the sky and reveals himself to the crowd as Akihiko Kayaba, the game`s creator. He tells them that he intentionally removed the log-out option. He cautions that they cannot log-out by simply removing the NerveGear, the VR helmet they use to log-in the game, as it will kill them instantly. The only way to log out is for the players to beat and clear all 100 floors of the game. Should they die in the game, their real bodies will perish as well. As a parting gift, Akihiko gives them a mirror that alters their in-game avatars to resemble their real appearance. Kirito asks Klein to follow him to the next town to level up before resources are depleted, but Klein politely declines as he wishes to remain with his friends. Kirito then heads out, vowing to be free from the game. By the end of the first month, 2,000 players have died and the 1st floor has yet to be cleared.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "Kirito attends a meeting organized by an idealistic Diabel, who announces to the attendants that his party has found the boss of the 1st floor tower. He rallies everyone to team up and beat the boss, Illfang the Kobold Lord, which will open up the 2nd floor. Parties are formed and Kirito teams up with a girl named Asuna. A new player named Kibaou blames the Beta Testers of the game for running away to loot and level up while leaving the new players behind. Another player named Agil defends the Beta players, revealing it was they who gave them the free guide book that helped them survive the game. Using the guide book, Diabel devises a strategy for fighting Illfang and his minions. Later that night, Kirito shares his food with Asuna while she tells him that she joined them because she felt compelled to do something rather than nothing. The next day, Diabel`s raid group arrives at the boss`s room and battles Illfang and his minions. When Illfang`s HP becomes low, Diabel goes for the finishing blow. Kirito tries to warn him after noticing Illfang has a different type of weapon from the one described in the guide book, but Illfang strikes down Diabel. Kirito realizes that Diabel was also a Beta player as he had attempted to obtain the boss`s rare item. As he dies, Diabel begs Kirito to defeat the boss and save the players. Having an epiphany on how Diabel was helping the other players while Kirito had only helped himself, Kirito experiences a renewed determination to defeat the boss. With Asuna and the raid group`s help, Kirito kills Illfang, clearing the 1st floor much to everyone`s joy. However, the celebration ends when Kibaou blames Kirito for Diabel`s death, as his knowledge as a beta player might have saved Diabel. Fearing continued fighting between the beta and new players, Kirito mocks everyone, telling them he is unlike the beta players who were clueless about the game, as he obtained far more knowledge of the Beta test than any other player. Everyone is repulsed by Kirito, and brand him a Beater -- a Beta player who cheats. As Kirito leaves for the 2nd floor, he advises Asuna to join a guild.\nSource: Wiki",

Kirito bonds with his new friends, especially Sachi, who confides in Kirito that she is afraid to die. Kirito assures her that he will protect her and that they will be free one day. On June 12, 2023, while Keita goes to buy a house for the guild, the Black Cats decide to earn some money by going to the upper floor dungeons, but get trapped in a room with higher level Mobs. Kirito desperately tries to save his friends but they are killed, including Sachi. Thinking that he is responsible for his friends` deaths, including Keita`s, who committed suicide upon learning what happened, Kirito displays increasingly reckless tendencies and goes on a dangerous quest to obtain an item that revives the dead. On December 24, 2023, Argo the informant tells Kirito of the existence of a special boss named Nicholas the Renegade, which drops the item. As Kirito travels to the boss, he is followed by Klein and his guild Fuurinkazan, concerned with Kirito`s safety. They are then surrounded by the Divine Dragon Alliance guild who are also seeking the item. Klein and his guild hold off the Divine Dragons, while Kirito goes off to face Nicholas alone. He emerges victorious, however to his despair, Kirito discovers that the boss item can only revive the dead within ten seconds of the person`s death. When Kirito returns to his room, he receives a farewell message from Sachi which she had recorded before her death to be delivered on Christmas Eve. In the message, Sachi asks Kirito not to blame himself over her death and that he should continue living to the end of the game. As she ends the message by humming \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", Kirito cries.\nSource: Wiki",

A month later on the 59th floor, Kirito is taking a nap until Asuna arrives and chastises him for being lazy, but Kirito persuades her to relax as well. To repay him for guarding her while she napped, Asuna offers to buy dinner for him at a town on the 57th floor. However, their meal is interrupted by a scream, and they rush out of the restaurant to find a player, Kains, hanging outside a church, impaled with a spear. He dies immediately after. As they investigate the murder, Kirito wonders how Kains was killed in a safe zone, speculating that either the victim was dueled by another player or that someone had found a new exploit to kill players. Yolko, a friend of Kains, mentions someone may have been spotted behind Kains as he was impaled. Asuna and Kirito travel to Egil`s shop to learn more about the murder weapon. Egil tells them that the weapon (Guilty Thorn) is a custom made weapon by a blacksmith named Grimrock. After informing Yolko of their discovery, she explains to them how she and Kains are related to Grimlock. Six months earlier, Yolko, Kains, and Grimlock were part of an eight-man guild called the Golden Apple, led by Griselda, Grimlock`s ingame wife. One day, the guild acquires a rare ring and votes whether to use it or sell it. Three members, Yolko, Kains and Schmitt, now a member of the Divine Dragon Alliance, vote to use it, but the other five vote to sell it. Griselda goes out to sell the ring and is killed. Yolko believes Kains`s killer is targeting the three of them for going against Griselda`s wishes. However, Schmitt fears that the identity of the killer is Griselda`s ghost, who wants revenge against them. Yolko is then killed by a dagger thrown from the window.\nSource: Wiki",

Kirito wonders how it is possible to kill someone in a safe zone to which a paranoid Schmitt declares that the killer is Griselda`s ghost. After watching a dropped sandwich vanish and talking to Asuna about the game`s marriage system of inventory sharing, Kirito deduces how Yolko and Kains \"died\" and who was Griselda`s murderer. He explains to Asuna that Yolko and Kains are actually alive, and that they had merely faked their deaths by using a teleport crystal when their armor broke from the damage over time weapon effect to give the appearance of a player death. Yolko and Kains confront Schmitt at Griselda`s grave to investigate the identity of Griselda`s killer. After Schmitt explains that he had only followed instructions given to him and had not expected Griselda`s death, the three are surrounded by members of the notorious player-killing guild, Laughing Coffin, who have come to kill them. Yolko, Kains and Schmit are rescued by the timely arrival of Kirito, who intimidates the Laughing Coffin into retreating. Asuna arrives with the man who hires the Laughing Coffin and Griselda`s killer, Grimlock. Grimlock reveals that he is the assassin of Griselda, who is also his wife in the real world, because he is unable to accept that his kind, dutiful wife he loves has become a fearless, independent leader. Asuna admonishes Grimlock for Griselda`s death, telling him that he has never truly loved his wife and that he has been merely possessive. After Yolko, Kains and Schmitt capture Grimlock, Kirito and Asuna briefly discuss about marriage and Kirito states he would love his partner more after seeing a different side of her. Kirito and Asuna then see an apparition of Griselda thanking them.\nSource: Wiki",

The next day, Kirito arrives at Liz`s shop in search of a custom-made sword to buy. Much to Liz`s shock, Kirito`s sword, Elucidator, easily breaks her strongest sword. Angry and her pride hurt, Liz persuades Kirito to let her accompany him to the Western Mountain on the 55th floor to get a rare mineral from a dragon that eats crystals, so that she can use the mineral to make a stronger sword. When they arrive at the Western Mountain, Kirito tells Liz to hide when he fights the dragon. However, she ignores his advice and emerges from hiding halfway through the battle, believing the dragon almost defeated. The dragon blasts her into a deep pit with a powerful gale, and Kirito jumps in to save her. Despite surviving the fall, the pair cannot find a way out of the pit and are forced to sleep there for the night. Liz asks Kirito to hold her hand while they sleep, which brings her to the realization that she has feelings for him. The next morning, Kirito discovers that the mineral they are seeking, a Crystallite Ingot, is under the snow as the hole is the dragon`s nest. The dragon returns and Kirito grabs Liz with him as he stabs the dragon`s back, forcing it to carry them out the hole before jumping out. Now safe with the mineral, Liz creates a new sword, Dark Repulsor, for Kirito and denies payment. She instead asks Kirito to make her his exclusive smith and is about to confess her feelings to him, when a worried Asuna suddenly arrives. Realizing Kirito is the boy Asuna likes all along, Liz abruptly excuses herself from them. As Liz cries over her heartbreak, Kirito finds her and tries to comfort her. Accepting that her feelings would go unrequited, Liz pledges her support to Kirito as his smith if he promises to win the game and free them all.\nSource: Wiki",

Just as Kirito is about to deal the winning strike, Heathcliff mysteriously manages to dodge it and defeats Kirito.

      "description" : "Kirito, Asuna and Yui are resting at the church where Sasha takes care of the younger children, until Yulier, second-in-command from the Army, suddenly arrives. Yulier explains that the Army under their leader, Sinker, had good intentions of helping players but as the Army grew bigger, unscrupulous leaders within the Army began abusing their powers. Sinker was going to expel Kibaou over the Gleam Eyes incident, but the latter trapped him in a secret dungeon beneath 1st floor. Yulier then asks Kirito and Asuna for help in a rescue. The couple accept and, upon arrival at Sinker`s location in the dungeon, get attacked by a boss called \"the Fatal Scythe\". Kirito and Asuna tell Yulier to escape together with sinker and Yui as they fight the boss, but it is too strong. As the boss is about to strike down Kirito, Yui jumps in between them. The boss attacks, but the boss is unable to damage her due to her being an \"Immortal Object\". Yui then promptly defeats the boss. After the battle, Yui tells Kirito and Asuna that she has finally regained her memories. She explains that she is an AI counselor created by the game`s Cardinal system, whose purpose was to monitor and counsel the players on their mental state. On the day of game`s launch, Cardinal refused to allow her to interact with the players, and she was forced to watch their mental states deteriorate. Sometime after, Yui learned about the happiness of Asuna and Kirito and thus made an appearance in the 22nd floor forest to meet them. Despite the revelation, Asuna and Kirito still accept Yui as their \"daughter\", but Yui bids them farewell when she realises that she is to be deleted for her interference in the game. Refusing to accept her deletion, Kirito uses the GM console Yui left behind to save Yui`s data by turning her into a game item. With the data saved on his NerveGear local memory, Kirito and Asuna hope to recreate her in the real world.\nSource: Wiki",

He remarks that despite honing his fisherman skill, he is unable to cook delicious dishes with what he catches. Kirito then invites him to his home for Asuna to cook the fish he just caught for them. During their meal, Nishida mentions a huge fish he tried to catch many times but failed, and he asks Kirito to help him. Later, Nishida manages to hook the fish and passes the rod to Kirito to pull it away. The fish is revealed to be a huge monster which Asuna slays. Soon after, Kirito receives a summons from Heathcliff. Kirito and Asuna leave to meet up with him at the Knights of Blood headquarters, where they learn that a scouting party had been trapped and killed in the 75th level`s boss room. A team of players from several guilds, including Kirito and Asuna, is being assembled to fight the boss. Fearing for her safety, Kirito asks Asuna to stay behind, but Asuna refuses, declaring that she would rather die than live without him. She also surmises that all players` real bodies must be currently undergoing treatment in hospitals and that their condition cannot be preserved indefinitely. Therefore, simply fleeing to live by themselves in the game is not an option. Later, when the players enter the boss room, they are confronted by the Skull Reaper, a ferocious, skeletal monster capable of killing players in one blow. Kirito, Asuna and Heathcliff battle the creature head on, while the other players flank it.\nSource: Wiki",

Akihiko paralyses everyone except Kirito, and he then offers Kirito the chance to face him in a one-on-one duel where, should Kirito win, Akihiko would log out all the remaining players. After giving his best wishes to the others, Kirito accepts the challenge but is unable to overcome Akihiko`s absolute defense and intimate understanding of the game`s mechanics. As Akihiko readies the finishing blow, Asuna overcomes her paralysis and takes the hit instead, losing all her HP and disappearing as a result. Distraught by Asuna`s death, Kirito loses the will to fight and receives a fatal stab from Akihiko. However, at the point of death, Kirito remembers Asuna`s belief in him and re-materializes to defeat Akihiko using Asuna`s sword. They are both killed simultaneously and the game is declared cleared on November 7, 2024. Kirito then awakens high above the game world, where he finds both Asuna and Akihiko. Akihiko informs Kirito and Asuna that he has logged out all the other players as promised, and he also explains his motives for creating Sword Art Online before disappearing. Kirito and Asuna then tell one another their real names, Kirigaya Kazuto and Yuuki Asuna, and embrace each other as the world falls apart. To his surprise, Kazuto awakens in a hospital in the real world and, despite being physically weak, he sets off to search for the real Asuna.\nSource: Wiki",

The pair have a kendo spar, and though Kirito loses, Suguha is both shocked and curious about his unusual yet proficient sword fighting skills as a result of his time in SAO. Later, Kazuto goes to the hospital to visit Asuna who, along with 300 other players, has yet to wake up even after the SAO incident. It is there that he meets an associate of Asuna`s father, Sugou Nobuyuki. Much to Kazuto`s fury, Sugou tells him that he intends to be adopted into Asuna`s family while she is still comatose as a precursor to marriage. Claiming that this is his right since it was his company, RECTO Progress Inc., had been keeping Asuna alive after SAO`s developer Argus went bankrupt, he informs Kazuto that the ceremony will occur in a week and tells him not to see her again. Later at home, Kazuto breaks down before Suguha, who tells him not to give up, despite knowing Kazuto is actually her cousin and harboring her own feelings for him. The next morning, Kazuto receives an e-mail from Andrew Gilbert Mills, Egil`s real life persona, with a screenshot of an avatar resembling Asuna from another game.\nSource: Wiki",

He explains that the figure resembling Asuna was spotted somewhere on the game`s World Tree. Noticing that RECTO created the game, Kazuto decides to don his NerveGear once again and take up his role as Kirito in ALO. After selecting his character race as a Spriggan and diving in, he enters a strange warphole which leads him to a forest, where he finds to his surprise that his stats are identical to his SAO avatar`s, with the exception of his dual wielding skill. He also discovers that he still has the SAO in-game item containing Yui`s data, which he activates to bring Yui into ALfheim as a Navigation Pixie to their reunion. Yui deduces that the game is made using a copy of SAO`s servers, which was why all common skills and stats from SAO had been carried over to Kirito`s ALO avatar. As Kirito gets used to his flight controls, two Sylph players are being chased by Salamander players. Just as one is defeated and the other named Leafa outnumbered, Kirito crash lands before her and steps in to help defeat the assailants.\nSource: Wiki",

Desperate, Yui calls out to Asuna, who hears her cries and throws down the administrator`s key card, which Kirito catches. Resolving to get to Asuna`s location, Kirito bids farewell to Leafa and embarks on the Grand Quest himself to reach the top of the tree. Upon entering the dome at the tree`s base, Kirito is faced with hundreds of valiant guardians, which he angrily battles against. Despite his best efforts, Kirito is overwhelmed and runs out of HP. Shortly after, Leafa enters the dome and grabs Kirito`s flame which contains his soul, before successfully escaping to revive him. Leafa tries to talk Kirito out of re-entering the dome alone, but he remains determined. Leafa then hears him speak Asuna`s name, causing her to realize that Kirito is actually Kazuto. Upon discovering one another`s identities, they log out. In the real world, Kazuto then approaches Suguha, who reveals in great anguish that she had fallen in love with both of his identities and how she knew they were not true siblings. Heartbroken, Suguha shuts herself in her room leaving Kazuto outside her door in shock.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "Kazuto thinks back to the time when he was ten and learned that he was not related with Suguha, which resulted in him becoming detached from his family and increasingly engrossed with online gaming. However, due to his extended period trapped in SAO, he decides to make amends with his family. Wanting to sort things out, Kazuto asks Suguha to meet him in ALO. As Leafa contemplates whether she should stop seeing her brother in-game anymore, she runs into Recon, whose unsuccessful attempt to confess to her cheers her up. Leafa then challenges Kirito to a one-on-one duel, during which they both end up throwing it to apologize to each other. After Kazuto explains he won`t be able to say what he thinks of Suguha until Asuna is rescued, Leafa agrees to help him in his quest, dragging Recon along with her. Kirito once again takes on the guardians, this time with assistance from Leafa and Recon. As the number of guardians keep increasing, Recon uses a self-destruct spell to create a gap for Kirito to get through, but it is filled up all too soon. Just as things look dire, Sakuya and Alicia arrive with their armies to back them up. Using Leafa`s sword, Kirito manages to break through the guardians and reach the top, only to find a system administrator-locked door in his way. Then, using the admin key card Asuna gave them, Yui manages to open the door, teleporting her and Kirito to a new location.\nSource: Wiki",

However, they are suddenly hit by high gravity magic, which forces Yui to retreat, and are confronted by Oberon. As Oberon reveals his plans to control the human mind is almost complete, he chains Asuna up and starts to molest her in front of Kirito, who is stabbed into the ground by him. As Kirito falls into despair, he hears the voice of Akihiko, who encourages him to stand up and fight, realising the pain is nothing compared to the pain of SAO. Using Akihiko`s administrative functions, Kirito removes all of Oberon`s powers and challenges him to a fight with no pain absorption, showing him what true pain is before he finally destroys Oberon. After logging Asuna out to ensure her safety in the real world, Kirito meets with the remnant of Akihiko`s memory, who gives him an item called \"The Seed\" before leaving. After returning to the real world and giving his thanks to Suguha, Kazuto makes his way to the hospital to reunite with Asuna.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "Rushing to the hospital, Kazuto is attacked by an injured Sugou with a knife at the parking area. Kazuto disarms him, and after considering everything Sugou has done, Kazuto spares his life. Kazuto finally meets with Asuna where they have a tearful reunion. On May 16, 2025, Kazuto and Asuna have returned to school, attending a special school for students who were trapped in SAO. As they have lunch, Kazuto reveals Sugou was captured by the police after their fight and his crimes were exposed by one of his employees. The 300 players that were trapped by Sugou were released but his experiments shocked the public. Asuna`s father and his higher ups resigned and shut down ALO with other VRMMORPG following it as a result of the scandal. Later, Asuna, Kazuto and Suguha head to Andrew`s bar along with Liz/Shinozaki Rika, Silica/Ayano Keiko, Yolko, Kains, Sasha, Yulier, Sinker, Klein/Tsuboi Ryoutarou and his guild where they have a party to celebrate for clearing the game SAO. Andrew analyzed \"The Seed\" to be a program that allows anyone with a server to create their own VRMMORPG and transfer players to other VRMMORPG easily. \"The Seed\" is uploaded to the internet which revives the VRMMORPG genre. Later that night in Alfheim Online, Kirito meets up with Leafa where they share a dance and a heartfelt conversation in the sky. Directly afterwards the new floating castle Aincrad from SAO is brought into Alfheim Online which Kirito then professes his intention to clear all 100 floors of SAO. He is met with their friends from SAO and Alfheim Online flying towards the new Aincrad.\nSource: Wiki",
