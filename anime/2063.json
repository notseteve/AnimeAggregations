  "description" : "Ga-nime (画ニメ), a portmanteau of \"illustration\" (画) and \"anime\", is a relatively recent trend in Japanese animation to create highly aesthetic short anime films using non-traditional animation techniques, often directed by artists who have limited involvement with the anime industry. Typically, these films will utilize a series of illustrations accompanied by voice acting and music, with the only motion provided by extremely simplified limited animation, computer animation, camera movements such as panning and zooming, or stop-motion animation. They are generally produced by only a handful of staff members, with the director often writing, illustrating, or even scoring the piece themselves.\nSimilar to comics, ga-nime will be composed of a series of static pictures accompanied by music and speech. This \"limited-anime\" approach leaves behind the complex plot and characters found in most anime, and aims to stimulate the audience`s imagination through various techniques such as the manipulation of time between each picture.\nUsually creating an anime requires many staffs and an expensive budget, making it difficult for the artist to manage the project on his or her own, which results in a lack of creativity and coordination in most anime series.\nUnlike anime, ga-nime will limit the number of images used in each series, allowing the artist to better integrate his or her own style and feelings into the project. This new form of media has immense potential for pushing the level of style and creativity found in artworks to a whole new level.",
