Though she has a few memories of her past life, she was reborn into an RPG-like world in the weakest class, and worse, as the weakest rank. As a no-star Tamer, even her parents want nothing to do with her, and she soon realizes she must survive on her own. She learns to live off the land and salvage what she can from other people`s leavings. But when Ivy manages to tame http://anidb.net/ch132221 [Sora], a lowly slime, everything changes for both of them. There`s something special about this frail little monster, and Ivy`s care will bring out the best in both of them!\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment\nNote: The first three episodes received an early screening at a special event on November 23, 2023 at Science Museum Science Hall in Tokyo.
