  "description" : "Always ready for a fight! Destruction for destruction`s sake! The online streamer Aoringo is a troll, making the worst of the worst of boundary-pushing flamebait content and raking in the revenue from the hate-watchers. You may think he`s nothing more than a bottom feeder and a drain on society, but in reality, he`s high school dropout Soji Enishiro, a caring older brother with a sweet tooth who loves nothing more than his little sister.

But then, something very strange begins to happen...\nSource: K Manga",
