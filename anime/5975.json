  "description" : "* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr6886 [Kamachi Kazuma], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr6874 [Haimura Kiyotaka].\nSet in Academy City, a city of scientifically advanced superhuman students, located to the west of Tokyo, in a world where magic is also real. http://anidb.net/ch2342 [Kamijou Touma]`s right hand, the Imagine Breaker, can negate all magic, psychic, or divine powers, but not his own bad luck. One day he finds a young girl, http://anidb.net/ch870 [Index], hanging on his balcony railing. She turns out to be a nun from the Church of England, and her mind has been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum — all the magical texts the Church has removed from circulation. His encounter leads him to meet others from the secret world of science and magic and right into an adventure where science and magic collide.\nTouma`s unusual power then places him at the centre of conflicts relating magicians and science-based espers in Academy City. As Touma tries to help and protect his friends, he learns the people he knows are not quite what they appear to be. To make thinks worse he begins to attract the unwanted attention of powerful magicians and espers alike, as they try to unravel the secrets of Academy City and Index.",

His mission was actually to protect Index, who possesses photographic memory of the 103,000 grimoires implanted in her mind called the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Angered by Stiyl`s harsh treatment of Index, Touma attacks him, to which Stiyl responds by using fire magic and is surprised when Tōma nullifies the spell. To stop Touma, Stiyl summons a fire creature known as Innocentius. When Touma finds himself unable to negate the creature, Index activates John`s Pen, her self-protection system personality, to reveal that Innocentius` power comes from runes placed around the building. Touma defeats Stiyl and Innocentius by setting off sprinklers to wash away the runes. However, because of Index`s wounds and Touma`s inability to use magic, he brings Index to the only non-esper he knows, that being his teacher Komoe Tsukuyomi.\nSource: wikipedia",
