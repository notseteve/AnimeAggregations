Meanwhile, Ryuko takes Mako to the ruins of her old house, where she shares about the circumstances surrounding her father`s death. Finding no further clues, Ryuko and Mako head home, but their scooter runs out of gas. Ira drives them to the gas station, but during their ride, they are attacked by the automotive and airsoft clubs. Ira absorbs the hits, which power up his uniform, and lays waste to his opponents.

After hacking into Honnouji`s security cameras and finding Satsuki`s location, Ryuko`s allies find out from Satsuki`s actions that she is planning something. With renewed resolve, they set forth on Aikuro`s Naked Sol warship and head towards Honnouji Academy to join the fight. Ryuko arrives and takes on Nui, who is also revealed to have a Life Fiber body. Ragyo ensnares Ryuko and forces her to wear Junketsu, starting to rewrite her memories. Meanwhile, Satsuki escapes from her confinement and rejoins Nudist Beach on the Sol. As Ryuko, now clad in Junketsu, arrives on the ship to attack, Satsuki dons Senketsu and confronts Ryuko.",
