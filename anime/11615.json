  "description" : "An up-and-coming power player, http://anidb.net/ch39487 [Kagami Taiga], is just back from America. When he comes to Seirin High School, he meets the super-ordinary boy, http://anidb.net/ch39488 [Kuroko Tetsuya]. Kagami is shocked to find that Kuroko isn`t good at basketball; in fact, he`s bad! And he`s so plain that he`s impossible to see. But Kuroko`s plainness lets him pass the ball around without the other team noticing him, and he`s none other than the sixth member of the Miracle Generation.\nSource: Crunchyroll",

      "description" : "The first match of Seirin vs Tôô Gakuen at the Winter Cup. Seirin swore they would get revenge from the Inter-High, but Aomine`s talents grew even stronger and Kuroko`s new move is seen through. After having all of his efforts denied by his former light, Aomine, Kuroko is benched and faces humiliation. Seeing his partner like this, something almost beast-like awakens within Kagami, and he challenges Aomine. Aomine had lost almost all sense of fighting, until he and Kagami both intensely face off with each other as they go into the Zone.\nSource: crunchyroll",

      "description" : "Seirin faces off with Yosen in the quarter finals of the Winter Cup. Facing Yosen’s impenetrable defense with Murasakibara at its center, Kuroko manages to shoot his first point. Meanwhile, the ace battle between Kagami and Himuro also heats up. An intense battle is held until the very end. Next, Seirin faces off with Kaijo in the semi finals. Cautious of Kaijo`s ace, Kise, and his Perfect Copy ability, Seirin works fast and hard to take the lead. Kise hurts his leg and is benched, so Seirin thinks they now have their chance, but then Kaijo shows them exactly what they can do even without Kise.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Despite struggling with Akashi`s Emperor Eye that sees through everything, Midorima and Takao fight back with their consecutive plays, and the whole Shutoku team bites back at Rakuzan. However, it doesn`t take long before Akashi crushes all of their hopes. It is decided that the finals will be fought between Seirin and Rakuzan.
