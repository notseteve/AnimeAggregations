  "description" : "* Based on a mystery sci-fi light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr72672 [Kikuishi Mareho] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr72673 [Nozaki Tsubata].\nIn an alternate 2023, the Your Forma, a miraculous \"smart thread\" technology initially developed to treat a massive outbreak of viral encephalitis, has become an integral part of daily life. But these convenient devices come with an invasive drawback—they record every sight, sound, and even emotion their users experience.\nFor electronic investigator http://anidb.net/ch145262 [Echika Hieda], diving into peoples` memories via the Your Forma and hunting for evidence to solve the toughest crimes is all part of a day`s work. The problem is, she`s so good at what she does that her assistants literally fry their brains trying to keep up with her. After putting one too many aides in the hospital, the top brass finally furnish Echika with a partner on her level, a brilliant yet cheeky android named http://anidb.net/ch145263 [Harold Lucraft]. Does this unlikely duo have what it takes to resolve their mutual suspicions and avert a deadly technological infection from sweeping across the globe before it`s too late?\nSource: Yen Press",
