  "description" : "* A short film using the Chinese ink wash painting technique, based on the Chinese proverb \"When the snipe and the clam grapple, it`s the fisherman who stands to benefit\".\nA fisherman was attracted by a snipe and a clam while fishing. He tried to capture both but to no avail. A kingfisher caught a worm, but the clam took the worm away. When the clam tried to eat the worm, the snipe snatched the worm and ate it. The clam was very angry, and a grapple occurred between the snipe and the clam. The fisherman was delighted to observe the grapple. The idiom warns against fighting each other because a third party may be taking advantage of the two involved in the fighting.\nSource: douban\nNote: This short has won several international awards, including the Jury Prize Silver Bear (Short Film) in the 34th Berlin International Film Festival (1984).",
