  "description" : "The battle in the Digital World ended in victory for the Digimon and humans who joined forces and fought together. One year after that battle...\nTagiru Akashi, a member of the Xros Heart street basketball team, has set his sights on surpassing his respected senior, Taiki Kudou, and his classmate, Yuu Amano, to become the team`s top star. But then, in the midst of these peaceful days, a mysterious boy and his companions appear before Taiki. In warning, the boy tells Taiki, \"Don`t try to get involved in what`s about to happen in this town,\" and disappears...\nClueless to what`s going on in the town, Tagiru visits an arcade. There he experiences a strange sensation, as though the flow of time around him is thrown off kilter. Then he senses an unknown presence lurking around the area...\nTagiru hears the voice of someone who seems to be injured and follows it through a distorted space in the air, finding himself in a world called \"DigiQuartz,\" where time progresses differently from that of the real world. In DigiQuartz, Tagiru watches as a team of two boys and a girl hunt a monster they call a Digimon. This is the very trio that had appeared before Taiki with the warning to steer clear - Ryouma, Ren, and Airu.\nTagiru then meets Gumdramon, the owner of the voice that had spoken to him in the arcade, and saves him from being hunted by Ryouma and his companions. Tagiru instantly befriends Gumdramon and they decide to join the Digimon Hunt together. Then Tagiru visits a watchmaker`s shop on the outskirts of town, where the mysterious old Watchmaker, rumored among many Digimon Hunters, gives him a Xros Loader.\nReturning to DigiQuartz, Tagiru then encounters MetalTyrannomon. He immediately attempts a Digimon Hunt, but he and Gumdramon are soon backed into a tight spot by MetalTyrannomon`s counterattack. Just then the Xros Loader begins to glow, and Gumdramon Digivolves into Arresterdramon! With his greatly heightened power, he defeats MetalTyrannomon, ending Tagiru`s first Digimon Hunt in success.\nThus the Hunter boys Taiki, Tagiru, and Yuu begin a brand new adventure as they go on to Hunt the Digimon that appear in the human world!",

Determined to help his classmate, Tagiru vows to make Katsuji into the kind of ramen shop that customers will line up to get into. But just when he`s about to take action, Katsuji`s ramen changes dramatically and people start to form a long line to eat it. Lurking behind this change are the shadows of Digimon called Ogremon and Fugamon! Ogremon and Fugamon have opened a ramen shop in the Digimon world, DigiQuartz, but since business is poor, they approach Katsuji, Masaru`s father and the owner of the ramen shop Katsuji. They agree to cooperate using Ogremon and Fugamon`s superb noodles with Katsuji`s prized soup. Katsuji`s shop thrives as a result. However, at the same time, Katsuji`s kind temperament changes and he begins to yell at customers. Wanting his kind father back, Masaru decides to make his own ramen to open his father`s eyes. What will happen when Tagiru and company stand by his side in this ramen face-off?!\nSource: crunchyroll",
