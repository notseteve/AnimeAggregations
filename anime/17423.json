  "description" : "* Based on a slice of life comedic manga by http://anidb.net/cr67367 [Yamada Hitsuji].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch130235 [Saku] is an ordinary young woman who works long hours and lives alone with her cat, http://anidb.net/ch130236 [Yukichi]. Yukichi, however, is not an ordinary house cat. For one, the temperamental feline towers over Saku and walks around on two legs. Instead of playing with toy mice, he scours supermarket flyers for good deals and keeps the house spotless. With a pet like that, it’s hard to tell who’s taking care of who!\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment\nNote: The first three episodes received an early screening at a special event on June 25, 2023 at United Cinemas Toyosu in Tokyo. The regular TV broadcast started on July 8, 2023.",
