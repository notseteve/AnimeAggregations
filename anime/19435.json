  "description" : "Superhuman Chiharu and cyborg Makina got arrested for breaking space traffic laws, and police officer Ryouko sent them to clean up an interplanetary train, the so-called \"Milky☆Subway\", as community service. They`re going to have to do it alongside a crew of misfits who got caught around the same time: superhuman pair Akane and Kanata and cyborg pals Kurt and Max. Those six are now stuck with each other, but at least it`s a simple enough job they`ve got ahead of them... Or at least it was, until the train suddenly took off into deep space!\nSource: Official English website",
