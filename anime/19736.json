  "description" : "Office worker Rinko, 24, lives alone and is secretly an otaku. One day, her apartment gets connected to the two neighboring rooms through a \"hole\" in the wall. In the room on the left is a fresh-faced yet mysterious guy who is overly-sweet to Rinko. The room on the right is occupied by a guy with violent tendences who is similarly mysterious... But wait! \"I... I think I know him!\"\nRinko`s only source of solitude, her apartment, has been turned upside down. Now, every day is full of heart-pounding surprises!\nSource: MangaPlaza",
