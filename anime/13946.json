When his son is born, the demons extract their payment, the child is born without limbs, facial features or skin. The baby is set adrift in the river and left to its fate. Sixteen years later, he is now a young man, travelling alone wearing prosthesis made by Dr. Jukai. While hunting a sludge-like demon, he encounters Dororo, a young petty-thief being beaten by three men Dororo cheated out of their goods. The demon attacks and devours the men, but the youth destroys it with blades inside his prosthetic arms. Following the death of the demon Deiki, the youth`s skin appears, and a demon statue in the Hall of Hell is split by lightning. Meanwhile back in Ishikawa, Daigo`s second son Tahoumaru returns home from hunting, although his mother still misses her first son.\nSource: Revolvy",

Dororo takes the young man to a village run by the beautiful woman named Bandai offering to slay a local monster for a reward. While there, they meet the blind monk Biwa-Houshi who can also detect people’s souls. They discover that Bandai is a demon who has been eating travellers, and Young Man slays her. A strange being reveals to them that the Villagers were helping Bandai, while taking the money of the travelers for themselves; It was this being that the villagers wanted slayed as it constantly rang a small bell, that the very first traveler held, and the noise of which is haunting the villagers.

He once worked for Lord Shiba, crucifying wounded enemies until the day his loved one was killed by Shiba`s soldiers and he leapt into the sea. He was rescued by foreigners and learned how to make prosthetics. One day he found Lord Daigo Kagemitsu`s abandoned and limbless infant on a riverbank. He took the child home and later made prostheses for him so that he could move about and appear human. Six years later Jukai gave him the name Hyakkimaru. After Hyakkimaru killed the demon Kamaitachi and his right leg was returned to him, Jukai realized that although the boy attracted demons, his body parts were probably stolen by demons. Later, Jukai inserted swords into Hyakkimaru’s prosthetic arms before the young man left Jukai to travel alone. Back in the present, Hyakkimaru returns to Dororo and Houshi after killing a demon, but now appears to have the ability to feel pain.\nSource: Revolvy",

      "description" : "A dark cloud containing the demon Nokosaregumo appears over a village and the villagers hurriedly prepare woman as a sacrificial bride to appease it. As Hyakkimaru and Dororo see the bridal parade travelling up the mountain, Saru, a wild boy, tries to stop the sacrifice. After Saru tells them the story of Nokosaregumo and the kind woman he considers his sister, Dororo and Hyakkimaru agree to exterminate the demon. A dark cloud envelops them, and Nokosaregumo appears as a large centipede. However, Hyakkimaru is unable to differentiate the demon from the cloud as they both show red to his vision and it swallows the woman. Dororo and Saru devise a plan to create an explosion using the sulphurous gases emitted by the mountain which sets the demon ablaze but has little effect. Dororo then jumps on Nokosaregumo`s head and calls to Hyakkimaru, enabling him locate and attack the centipede by sound, destroying it. The dark cloud dissipates and Hyakkimaru, Dororo and the woman (who was swallowed whole and not yet digested) fall into a spring. Saru is relieved to find his sister alive and agrees to move into the village with her. Hyakkimaru regains his sense of smell and addresses Dororo by his name for the first time.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Meanwhile the drought in the Daigo worsens, and lord Kagemitsu is advised of the Asakura clan gathering on their border. He visits the temple and finds more demon statues destroyed, and the demons inform him Hyakkimaru is still alive and slowly retrieving his body. His son Tahoumaru also discovers his father is searching for a baby. Later, Tahoumaru and his two bodyguards, Mutsu and Hyogo, encounter a village where they speak of a monster in the lake which eats the fishermen. He leads a group of villagers in their boats onto the lake and attacks and damages the monster, but it is too fierce and they are forced to retreat. Tahoumaru then has the villagers construct a trap, intending to lure the monster into a shallow channel where the water can be drained out. The plan works, and Tahoumaru, Mutsu and Hyogo attack it together. However, the monster fights back and almost devours Hyogo, but at the last minute Hyakkimaru arrives and slays it. Tahoumaru is left wondering who the stranger is.\nSource: Wikipedia",

There, they see a play depicting Daigo as a great slayer of demons, protected by the Goddess of Mercy. The Biwa-Houshi is also present and decides goes visit the Hall of Hell to seek the truth for himself. Hyakkimaru and Dororo decide to visit the remnants of Fort Banmon built by Daigo on the site of a village he destroyed which is supposedly cursed by a demon. They find a partial timber wall where Asakura pin bodies of their enemies with arrows. They encounter a young boy, Sukeroku, who wishes to cross the boundary to the Asakura side and rejoin his family. Meanwhile, Tahoumaru`s bodyguards report the incident with Hyakkimaru to Daigo, who realizes that his son is alive, and determines to kill him and maintain the prosperity of his domain, ignoring his wife`s pleas. Tahoumaru overhears their exchange and later comes across a demented woman who was present at Hyakkimaru`s birth. She tells him how the demons \"ate everything\" but left the boy alive. Night falls at Banmon and a kyūbi no kitsune (nine-tailed fox demon) (九尾の狐) appears. While it attacks Hyakkimaru, Sukeroku uses the distraction to pass the wall with Dororo in pursuit, however he is captured by Asakura sentries. The demon is eventually chased away by the arrows of a squadron led by Daigo himself, who then approaches Hyakkimaru.\nSource: Wikipedia",
