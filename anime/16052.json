  "description" : "\"URVAN\" is set in Sasebo City, which was produced by Toei Animation`s new IP research and development team \"PEROs\" with the cooperation of Nagasaki International University.\nBy utilizing remote location scouting and the latest communication tools, it is a work that challenged the production of animation during the Corona pandemic, creating a new charm of the area without going to Sasebo, which was the stage.\n- What is \"URVAN\" -\n\"URVAN\" is said to be the etymology of \"Obon\", that is, \"Urabone\".\nIt refers to the ancient Avestan word \"Ulvane (soul)\" around the 7th century BC.\nThis work, \"URVAN\", is a mysterious and somewhat nostalgic cyberpunk action that mixes \"unusual\" and \"everyday\" with the motif of Obon, which welcomes and sends out spirits in Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture.\nThe actual scenery of Sasebo expressed as an animation changes into the world of cyberpunk, and two mysterious men and women run through the mysterious city.\nIn addition, throughout the entire story, a number of Sasebo`s representative special products are also colored in the video, expressing them in a \"pointed\" and \"shining\" form so that even locals can enjoy them freshly.",
