  "description" : "* An anime short based on http://anidb.net/cr40605 [Yabe Tarou]`s Oya-san to Boku (Landlady and Me) manga.\nYabe and his landlady go for lunch at an udon restaurant at the station on a windy day. Yabe remarks that he normally goes to the nearby gyūdon or hamburger restaurants, and the landlady says she has not seen them but would like to try them. Her father was very strict so they would never go to festivals or the like, but she also always wanted to try cotton candy. She reminiscences about the time before the war when she would come to the station to use the phone, and there were fireflies by the river.\nSource: ANN",
