I`m Akira Toriyama.\nI`m currently working on a new Dragon Ball.\nThe title is \"Dragon Ball DAIMA\".\n\"DAIMA\" is a made-up term, which in Japanese characters would be \"大魔\" or in English would be something like \"Evil.\"\nDue to a conspiracy, Goku and his friends are turned small.\nIn order to fix things, they`ll head off to a new world!\nIt`s a grand adventure with intense action in an unknown and mysterious world.\nSince Goku has to make up for his petite size, he uses his Nyoibo (Power Pole) to fight, something not seen in a long time.\nI came up with the story and settings, as well as a lot of the designs.\nI`m actually putting a lot more into this than usual!\nThings will unfold that close in on the mysteries of the Dragon Ball world.\nHope you all enjoy these different-from-usual battles that are cute and powerful!!\n-Akira Toriyama",
