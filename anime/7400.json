  "description" : "* Based on http://anidb.net/cr19832 [Kamino Okina]`s Asobi ni Iku yo! light novel series.\nThe story revolves around http://anidb.net/ch17529 [Kakazu Kio], an ordinary high school freshman living in Okinawa. A girl with cat ears appears before him during a memorial service for one of his family ancestors. The girl calls herself http://anidb.net/ch17527 [Eris] and claims to be an alien. Before long, fanatical alien worshippers and a mysterious government agency are in hot pursuit of Eris, but Kio`s childhood friend http://anidb.net/ch17530 [Manami] — who wants to follow in her father`s footsteps in the CIA — captures Eris. Kio finds himself having to protect Eris from everyone.\nNote: The first episode received an early screening in Tokyo Joypolis amusement park on June 26, 2010. The regular television broadcast started on July 11, 2010.",

      "description" : "The episode starts with three members of different factions listening to a special newscast about an alien message, the first part of which has been translated to mean \"coming to play\". One of the members is then called to battle aboard an enemy ship. She successfully infiltrates the ship and disarms the Captain. The situation is disrupted by a UFO passing too close to both ships. When the same member comes to, the enemy captain detonates the ship.\n \nLater, during a memorial service for one of his ancestors, Kio Kakazu finds a cat-like alien sitting at the buffet table. The alien introduces herself as Eris, and the two have a short conversation before Kio accidentally drinks beer and passes out. The next morning, Kio wakes up with a hangover and finds Eris sleeping half naked next to him in bed. Kio`s startled cry wakes her up, and she heals his hangover with a handheld device.\n \nManami Kinjou and Maki Itokazu then visit Kio, and upon seeing Eris half naked and with cat ears and a tail, they misinterpret the situation, thinking that Kio brought a girl home and forced her to cosplay all night. After discovering that Eris is an alien, they both abruptly leave without saying why. Kio goes on a walk to gather his thoughts and runs into Aoi Futaba, who asks Kio on a date. Aoi is interrupted by a man in a car who she names as her Uncle. He offers her a ride home.\nIt is later revealed that Manami is in recruiting to become part of the CIA, Aoi is a Momiji for the Immigration Bureau of Japan, and Itokazu is the leader of an organization of SF fans called \"Beautiful Contact\", and they are all given orders to eliminate Eris. \nSource: Wikipedia",

As they are waiting, however, Itokazu and \"Beautiful Contact\" attack Kio and Eris, and are about to kill both of them when Aoi disobeys orders to wait and saves Kio. She then moves to kill Eris, but Kio begs the Momiji (not knowing it is Aoi) to spare her. She obliges, but as soon as she leaves, Manami appears with CIA back-up, knocks Kio out and captures Eris, but not before Kio sees Manami`s watch and knows it is her.\n \nLater, Kio confronts Manami and begs her to help him find Eris. Manami contacts Aoi for extra help, and, receiving help from his uncle, Kio blackmails Itokazu and Beautiful Contact into helping as well. Together, they succeed in breaking into the military compound where Eris has been given to the DIA, only to find that she has already broken herself out.\nThe episode ends with the rest of the Catian fleet appearing over the city, announcing their existence and their intent to negotiate a treaty with the Japanese government, as a result of Eris submitting a report about grilled beef. \nSource: Wikipedia",

They are taken to a play room with Antonia who is dressed like a giant Assist-a-roid.

The girls infiltrate the set and rig the boat with real weapons, but they are caught by Kawasaki, who contracts them into his film. After being forced into Playboy-like costumes, Aoi and Manami steal the boat and break into the yacht to find that Kio and Eris have switched clothes, enabling Kio to use the power suit`s strength-enhancing capabilities. They are stopped by Antonia and one of her maids, but Kio convinces Antonia to let them go. Antonia offers them escape in the emergency sea plane.\nAoi sabotages the ship`s engines, but is caught by an agent of Dogsia, who is destroying the ship in the hopes that it will take Eris with it. Aoi is trapped by a pile of steel girders and then knocked unconscious by a missile explosion, to be saved by Kio still in Eris`s suit. As Kio runs to catch the plane, Aoi regains consciousness and, thinking it is a dream, confesses to Kio. \nSource: Wikipedia",

They decide that Eris looks too human, and instead ask her if they could use her ship or her robots. The footage of the ship looks like it is being held by strings due to its design, and the robots look more like chibi dolls. They decide to go for a romance film. Upon hearing this, Eris` hormones go berserk and she assaults Kio, something she has done several times earlier anytime something one has said sounds similar to romance or sex.\n \nMeanwhile, Aoi wants to practice cooking to impress Kio, but due to her frequent failures she wastes a lot of food. At the same time, Manami wants to practice shooting, but she can`t do it in Kio`s backyard. Chaika takes them to a virtual room on board the mothership, where they can fulfill their respective desires without it bothering anyone. She also makes it a point that the Catia without mates use it to satisfy their sexual desires during heat and offered if they would like to try it out as well, much to the girls` embarrassment. Aoi asks for a Kio to be her taste-tester. Manami asks for a shooting gallery with a wide assortment of weaponry, and for an M134 Minigun in particular, which turns out to be too heavy for her to lift. She asks for a Kio to help her lift it, who tells her in a very Kio-like manner that he can`t lift it. Manami asks virtual-Kio what he thinks of various people, eventually ending up on herself. He confesses that he once had feelings for her, but when he heard she was hanging out with Jack (unaware this was her female CIA handler), he thought she was already dating someone and she ended up being just a friend.\n \nBack at home, Aoi gives the real Kio a taste of a recipe she \"perfected\" with virtual-Kio, only to find out that virtual-Kio had lied to make Aoi feel good about her cooking. Chaika points out that virtual-Kio and the real Kio would naturally have different thoughts, but Manami still has her doubts. The episode ends with Eris taking pills that will, to her extreme disappointment, prematurely end her first mating season. The episode ends with her sadly calling out to Kio.\n \nSource: Wikipedia",

Kio`s club-mates ask him if he is going to the film camp, and asks Eris if she would like to go on the trip as well. As a result, Eris, Antonia, Aoi, Manami, and Antonia`s maids all become members of the film club with the intention of going to the camp.\n \nMeanwhile, a group of Dogsian Assist-a-roids are robbing surrounding areas of electronic equipment, due to their inability to self-repair. The Dogsian ambassadors reveal a specially made Assist-a-roid that closely resembles a Catian Assist-a-roid.\n \nOnce at the camp, Antonia offers Eris a number of high-end swim suits for her to wear. When the other girls inquire about all of the ones that Eris refuses, Antonia allows them to wear the ones Eris doesn`t like. Later, when they are all showing off their expensive swim suits, the girls realize to their dismay that they have all had holes cut in the rear to accommodate Eris` tail, due to one of the girls mistakenly wearing her bottom piece backwards. At dinner, Kio asks if he can talk to Aoi about something in private, but ends up asking if she can teach him to fight. Once alone, Aoi realizes that she is out of her league in the running for Kio. Eris appears, and Aoi takes out her frustration on her. Suddenly a young girl named Ichika appears, and at the same time, the camp gets attacked by the Dogsian Assist-a-roids. They are easily defeated with the help of some Accel-Form cards that give Aoi inhanced speed and strength, and later when the specially made Dogsian Assist-a-roid appears to help them in their fight.\nSource: Wikipedia",
