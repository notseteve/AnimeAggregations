      "description" : "Nearly a year after the Sword Art Online incident, a new VRMMORPG known as Gun Gale Online has taken Japan by storm. One day, as a top-ranked player named XeXeeD appears on a streamed broadcast via his avatar, a cloaked man calling himself and his weapon \"Death Gun\" fires a bullet at XeXeeD`s avatar through a video screen, causing XeXeeD to suddenly convulse and disconnect. A month later, Kirigaya Kazuto is called to meet up with Kikuoka Seijirou of the Ministry of Internal Affairs` Virtual Division, who reveals that XeXeeD`s user was found dead of acute heart failure a few days after his avatar was shot, also showing evidence of a similar case involving the death of a second GGO user. As Kazuto states his doubts that a game could cause someone`s heart to fail, Kikuoka, believing Death Gun is specifically targeting professional GGO players, asks Kazuto to once again take up the role of Kirito and investigate what is causing the victims to die. Remembering all the people who died in SAO, Kazuto thinks over his decision whilst spending time with Asuna at the park. Meanwhile, in the world of GGO, a sniper known as Sinon is in top form.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "In a flashback, on September 14, 2025, Sinon, who had accidentally fallen down a trap chute while navigating a dungeon below SBC Gurokken in GGO, discovers a boss-class monster and decides to die while trying to defeat it. To her surprise, the position she chose for her attack was out of the monster`s attack range, and thus, by conserving her ammo and accurately hitting the boss`s weak spot, she is eventually able to defeat it and acquire a new sniper rifle, the PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II. In the present day, during an ambush on an enemy squadron, Sinon attempts to snipe a target, but he turns out to be a bodyguard named \"Behemoth\", who overwhelms her squadron with a heavy machine gun. When Sinon and Behemoth are the only ones remaining on the battlefield, Sinon manages to shoot Behemoth with her Hecate while falling from the air, earning her victory in the gunfight, despite suffering severe damage to her avatar. Meanwhile, in Alfheim Online, Kirito plans to tell Asuna about something.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "While walking home, Asada Shino, Sinon`s real-life counterpart, is bullied by three schoolmates, led by Endou, but they are warded away by her friend Shinkawa Kyouji, who introduced her to GGO in the first place, as a form of immersion therapy for her fear of guns. After talking about their personal lives, Shino leaves for home. There, she tries holding a gun replica, but this induces a flashback to when she was eleven years old; while she was at a postal office with her mother, a man carrying a gun tried to rob the office, shooting an employee and threatening to kill other people. When the robber aimed his gun at her mother, Shino attacked him, wrestled the gun out of his hand, and shot him repeatedly, killing him. The flashback triggers a panic attack from Shino. Meanwhile, Kirito informs Asuna that he will be converting his ALO avatar to GGO, which surprises her, but she approves. As Kazuto, he goes to the hospital to log into GGO, while his real-life body will be watched by Aki Natsuki, a nurse who oversaw his condition while he was trapped in SAO. Shino logs into GGO as well. Meanwhile, Death Gun overhears an online voice-chat discussing Death Gun before looking at a photo of Sinon, grinning hungrily.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Kirito logs into GGO, but becomes baffled as to why his avatar has long hair and feminine qualities. These attributes lead to all of the male players mistaking him for a girl. Without many leads on how to reveal himself to Death Gun, Kirito wanders around the city until he spots Sinon. He explains to her that he wants to find directions to the General Governor`s Office to sign up for Bullet of Bullets (BoB), an intense PvP game mode. Mistaking him for a girl as well, Sinon directs Kirito towards a market to buy weaponry and armor. However, being out of cash, Kirito participates in an arcade game, \"Untouchable\", an extremely difficult QuickDraw game where the player must dodge the bullets fired from an NPC and then tag him to receive all of the credits placed in for bets. Sinon warns him the game is rigged, but after witnessing a player fail to win the game, Kirito decides to participate. Using the agility and training he acquired from his previous experiences in ALO (Alfheim Online), he is able to dodge all of the bullets and win all of the earnings, which surprises Sinon and other onlookers. Back at the weapon shop, Kirito mulls over the better weapons with the aid of Sinon, and decides to purchase an energy sword called a Photon Sword, then an FN Five-seven at Sinon`s request. Back outside, Sinon realizes they only have ten minutes to get to the General Governor`s Office and sign up for BoB, but Kirito spots a buggy station and commandeers one of the buggies, taking himself and Sinon to the Office down a highway. Impressed and exhilarated with his driving abilities, Sinon tells Kirito to go faster.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Kirito is surprised that the registration asks for his real-life information, and he leaves the fields blank. He is then registered into the same block as Sinon, and both are able to make it to the finals due to the ladder arrangement. Before they can enter BoB, however, there is a qualifying preliminary. Kirito promises to fight Sinon fairly if they are ever opponents. While waiting for the preliminary round to begin, Kirito reveals his gender after an embarrassing incident with Sinon in the changing room, and this creates a rift between them. Sinon demands that he make it to the finals so she can defeat him there, then proclaims her intention of \"killing all the strong ones\", which causes Kirito to briefly suspect her of being Death Gun. They then meet up with Kyouji in his GGO avatar, Spiegel. When Kirito is transferred to his first battle, he is initially put off-balance in the gunfight, but is able to defeat his first opponent using his Photon Sword. Upon returning to the preliminary waiting area, he is confronted by Death Gun, who Kirito feels he recognizes. Death Gun asks Kirito if he is the \"real deal\". He then catches a glimpse of a tattoo on Death Gun`s wrist and recognizes it as the mark of the SAO Red Player guild \"Laughing Coffin\".\nSource: Wikipedia",

Kirito then has a flashback to his time in SAO, when he and several others battled Laughing Coffin, and notes that he killed two members during that battle. He then realizes that the player who confronted him was actually Death Gun. Sinon later meets up with him and senses that something is wrong, but before Kirito can confide in her, he is teleported to his next duel, which he wins. Eventually, both Kirito and Sinon have made it into the finals. While waiting for Kirito, Sinon begins to feel he is just like her. She becomes frustrated when Kirito calmly walks straight toward her position, seemingly unwilling to dodge her bullet. Sinon fires at him repeatedly, but misses, and she personally confronts him about it. Remembering the promise he made to Sinon, Kirito apologizes and sets the rules for a rematch: he would move away by ten meters, and they would start fighting once he throws a bullet to the ground. Despite Sinon`s Hecate`s one-hundred percent hit rate at such a range, Kirito shows his confidence in his abilities. When the rematch begins, Kirito is able to slice Sinon`s bullet in half and hold her at the tip of his Photon Sword. Realizing that Kirito predicted the bullet path by watching her eyes, Sinon realizes that his strength goes beyond a virtual game and asks him what he is afraid of. He implies to her his experiences in SAO are not strength, but skill. He then asks her to surrender, since he doesn`t want to defeat a girl. In anger, she does so, stating that next time would be different.\nSource: Wikipedia",

After a flashback of Kazuto`s talk with Asuna the previous day, Suguha tells him that she is worried due to Kazuto having a frightening expression when he returned home last night. Kazuto then calms Suguha down by promising that he would be back. Meanwhile, Sinon vents her anger about Kirito to Kyouji, who then tells her that she isn`t acting like her normal self and, after a short conversation, tries to hug her, but is rejected by her. At the hospital, after seeing that Kazuto was troubled by something, Aki offers a free counseling session. When Kazuto tells her about how he killed the Laughing Coffin members in SAO, she tells him that she cannot help him with that burden, but reminds him that he killed them in order to protect others. After calming down, Kazuto logs into GGO. Meanwhile, in Alfheim Online, after completing a boss fight, Asuna, Leafa (Suguha), Klein, Lisbeth, and Silica get ready to watch the broadcast of the BoB tournament. In GGO, Sinon meets Kirito at the General Governor`s Office, and they tell each other that they will not lose.\nSource: Wikipedia",

After much persistence, Kirito is able to convince Sinon to explain to him the details of the BoB royale. After she explains the rules and regulations, Kirito stops Sinon from leaving and asks her whether there were BoB participants that she did not know about. He then finds out that, aside from him, there are three other players who had not participated in the previous tournaments. He then explains her his motivation behind that question, and she theorizes from his explanation that he is an SAO survivor. Later on, during the tournament, Sinon decides to target Dyne and Pale Rider. Having found a sniping position on the west side of the bridge that Dyne had crossed, she prepares to take action, but is stopped by Kirito, who instructs her to not shoot and just watch Dyne and Pale Rider`s battle. After Pale Rider defeats Dyne, he is suddenly shot with a silenced stun bullet and, after several moments, the shooter, Death Gun, reveals himself from the bridge. As Death Gun prepares to finish off Pale Rider, Kirito yells at the confused Sinon to shoot him before he does.\nSource: Wikipedia",

She and Kirito then decide to follow Death Gun, eventually going to the Lost City. However, since they could not find him along the way, they look for him during the next scan.

However, before Sinon could take a sniping position, she is suddenly shot with a stun bullet. Death Gun, who is actually Sterben, appears and proclaims that he is going to kill her.

Then, while thinking about how Death Gun was able to stop the heart of players by shooting them in the game, Kirito realizes that Death Gun did not shoot him with the pistol, but with the sniper instead. Based on this, Kirito deduces that Death Gun had to make preparations in real life to be able to kill the players with his pistol, and that he could`ve seen players putting their real-life details in the General Governor`s Office since it was an open space and the terminals did not offer much privacy. Kirito then brings up the idea that Death Gun could have used his mantle to spy on other players without being noticed. After some thinking, Kirito realizes that Death Gun was actually two people: one shoots the player in-game, the other kills the player in real life by injecting them with a lethal drug. Meanwhile, Kikuoka Seijirou logs onto ALO as Chrysheight under Asuna`s request and, after Yui reveals all the information on the incident that she had gathered, Chrysheight explains the situation to Asuna and the others. Asuna then requests Kazuto`s whereabouts and decides to go to him in real life. Back in GGO, Kirito and Sinon decide on a course of action and are surprised to find out that they were being filmed by one of the cameras.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Seeing as, even accounting for Sinon, Death Gun, and Pale Rider, the numbers of those killed and those who are still alive did not match the total, he speculates that Death Gun had more than one accomplice in charge of the killings in the real world. Fearing that Dark Wind might also be a target, Kirito and Sinon decide to set up the former as bait, while Sinon snipes Dark Wind and Death Gun from a distance when they arrive. Sometime later, while Dark Wind is closing in on Kirito, Death Gun attempts to kill Kirito himself. Sensing his intent to kill, Kirito manages to sense where he would be shot from and barely manages to dodge the bullet. Noticing a sniper shot, Dark Wind immediately hides behind an obstacle for cover, but he is then shot by Sinon and killed. Sinon then turns her attention to Death Gun, but, as she had already fired her first shot, which wouldn`t be detected, Death Gun is able to see her targeting him. The two of them fire at each other at the same time and, while Death Gun manages to destroy Sinon`s scope, she manages to destroy Death Gun`s weapon. However, as Kirito is about to strike Death Gun, the latter pulls out an estoc and counters the attack. After having a conversation with Kirito, Death Gun begins assaulting him with overwhelming speed.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Death Gun continues his assault on Kirito, greatly weakening him. While they are fighting, Kirito has a flashback to the meeting before the Laughing Coffin raid in Sword Art Online, recalling a strikingly similar player with the same red eyes as Death Gun. Kirito deduces that Death Gun is really Red-Eyed XaXa, the second-in-command of Laughing Coffin. As XaXa moves in for the final blow, Sinon creates the illusion of a bullet path using her experience in the game alone, causing XaXa to use his invisibility cloak to avoid it. However, Kirito pulls out his sidearm and fires it at XaXa, stopping the cloaking process and rendering him vulnerable. Using the willpower and strength he possessed in SAO, Kirito defeats XaXa, cutting him cleanly in half. Before he dies, XaXa reassures Kirito that their battle is not over. Kirito and Sinon then come to an agreement to end the BoB tournament by committing double in-game suicide using a grenade, crowning them both the winner, but not before they reveal to each other their real names. While logging out, Kirito finds that another BoB participant besides Pale Rider was mysteriously disconnected, confirming his suspicions that Death Gun has more than one accomplice. After logging out, Kyouji visits Shino, who, after making romantic advances on her, pulls out a syringe and reveals himself to be Death Gun`s second accomplice in the real-world killings. Kyouji then tries to kill Shino, but Kazuto bursts through Shino`s door and attacks Kyouji, holding him off while telling Shino, who recognizes Kazuto as Kirito, to run. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "While Kazuto tries to defend himself against Kyouji, he leaves an opening for the latter to attempt to inject him with the poison used to kill Death Gun`s victims. Shino then knocks Kyouji out with a stereo before checking on Kazuto`s condition, and finds that there was an electrode stuck to the part of his chest where Kyouji had tried to inject him, which protected him against the syringe. Several days later, Endou calls out to Shino, from whom she tries to demand money. When Shino refuses, Endou takes out a model gun and threatens her. However, when she unsuccessfully tries to fire it, Shino takes the gun from Endou and shows her that the safety needed to be disabled to fire, then shoots a can with it before returning it back to Endou. Shino is then picked up by Kazuto, who takes her to meet with Kikuoka to report on the Death Gun incident. During the report, it is revealed that the third conspirator in the Death Gun murders, another SAO survivor named Johnny Black, escaped while Kyouji and XaXa (who was Kyouji`s brother) were both institutionalized. After that, Kazuto takes Shino to the Dicey Cafe, where he introduces her to Asuna and Rika (Lisbeth). Kazuto then reveals that he had told the two girls about Shino`s past and explains that he had them help him find a certain person that she should meet. The person is revealed to have been a woman, named Oosawa Sachie, who was working at the post office during the robbery. Sachie thanks Shino for saving her life and tells her that she was pregnant at the time, so Shino had also saved the life of her daughter, Mizue. Kazuto then explains that he wants Shino to think about the people that she had saved by killing the robber and thus be able to forgive herself for it. As a result, Shino bursts into tears of happiness.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "One day at the end of the year, Suguha shows Kazuto a news article about the legendary item, the Holy Sword Excaliber, being discovered in ALO. They then call Asuna, Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, and Sinon to challenge the dungeon in the sky of Jötunheimr, where Excaliber was located. After preparing their items at Lisbeth`s arms shop and purchasing potions for the adventure, the group enters Jötunheimr via a secret passageway in Alne. At the end of the tunnel, they reach the top of Jötunheimr and Leafa calls Tonkii, a flying evil-god-class monster that they had befriended several months ago. The group climbs on Tonkii`s back and asks it to take them to the dungeon. However, along the way, Tonkii suddenly dives downward and stops at an altitude where they could see the ground. There, they see that players were cooperating with the humanoid evil-god-class monsters to massacre Tonkii`s kin, the beast evil-god-class monsters. As they watch the scene, a giant NPC, the Queen of the Lake Urðr, appears behind them. She explains that the massacre was ordered by the king of the giants, Þrym, who once threw the Holy Sword Excaliber into Urðr`s Spring and caused the world of Jötunheimr to turn into an icy wasteland. She then states that if all of Tonkii`s kin are slaughtered, she would lose her power and this would allow Þrym to invade Alfheim. To prevent this, Urðr requests the fairies to retrieve the Holy Sword Excaliber from the bottom of the ice dungeon, called Þrymheimr.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "At the entrance to Thrymheim, Yui explains that the quest the group was given was created by the Cardinal System`s Automatic Quest Generation Function and that if they do not succeed in their quest, a final war event, Ragnarok, will be triggered and the world of ALO will be subsequently destroyed, something the Cardinal System is capable of doing. Because they had worked so hard to develop their avatars, the group becomes more determined to finish the quest. At the end of the second floor of Thrymheimr, the group encounters two minotaurs, and they are forced to rely on Sword Skills that could deal elemental damage to them in addition to physical damage, but also leave the player rigid for a few seconds after the skill is used up. With Kirito revealing his new technique of using consecutive Sword Skills with each of his swords to avoid the period of rigidity, they are able to defeat the two minotaurs. Later, after defeating the boss guarding the entrance to the lowest floor of the castle, they encounter a female NPC trapped in an ice cage along the way. Although the others insist that it is a trap and plan to avoid her, Klein, captivated by the woman`s beauty, ignores their advice and frees the woman, who introduces herself as Freyja. Instead of running away, Freyja asks to join the group and Kirito reluctantly agrees to the request. After preparing for the final battle by recharging their buffs, the group enters the throne room, where they are met by the massive king of the frost giants, Thrym.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Thrym engages the group in battle, and they are supported by Freyja, who overwhelms Thrym with her own attacks. Thrym retaliates by freezing most of the group with an ice breath, then sending them flying backward with a powerful stomp of his foot. Just as he is about to finish them off, the uninjured Sinon distracts Thrym while the others search for a large golden hammer purported by Freyja to belong to her family, which is essential in defeating him. Kirito finds the hammer and throws it to Freyja, who catches it and then suddenly transforms into Thor, the Norse god of thunder, to everyone`s shock. Thor, enraged at Thrym for stealing his hammer, then joins the group in the fight against Thrym. Eventually, they manage to overwhelm him before Thor finishes him off. As a reward for aiding him in Thrym`s defeat, Thor grants Klein with Mjölnir, much to his dissatisfaction. A secret staircase then opens up, which leads the group to the bottom of Þrymheimr, and Excaliber. Kirito manages to pull it out of the frozen puddle, but it causes Þrymheimr to fall apart. As the floor they are on plunges down a chasm, they are saved by Tonkii, and Kirito, knowing that Excaliber is too heavy for him to jump onto Tonkii with, throws it down the chasm, but Sinon retrieves it with a magic-assisted arrow. She gives Excaliber back to Kirito under the condition that he remember her every time he uses the sword earning jealous and angry looks from everyone. The group then observes as the chasm is flooded with water and the World Tree`s roots extend to its surface, causing new trees to grow. Urðr and her sisters Verdandi and Skuld appear and thank them for saving Jötunheimr, and Urðr gifts Kirito with Excaliber. Sometime later, in the real world, Kazuto, Suguha, and Shino test out a device that converts real-time footage into pseudo-3D for Yui to interact with, before having lunch with the rest of the group, celebrating the conclusion of the quest.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Andrew tells them about the revealed contents of the upcoming ALO update, including the introduction of the 21st-30th floors of New Aincrad. On Christmas Eve, when the update takes place, the group challenges the 21st Floor Boss, and after a fierce battle, the group manages to reach the 22nd Floor, and Kirito and Asuna purchase their old home again. Later on, as the group does homework at the house, Lisbeth asks Asuna if she heard of stories about Absolute Sword, an unbeatable player who had likely converted his or her avatar from another game and was challenging other players at an island on the 24th Floor. As Asuna was away during the New Year and did not have access to the Internet, she is unaware of the story. The group decides to challenge Absolute Sword, but Leafa and Lisbeth are all beaten easily. Silica notes that players would likely continue to challenge the mysterious player as they are betting a powerful 11-hit Original Sword Skill. Kirito also fights Absolute Sword and loses. Asuna decides to challenge the player herself, but at that moment, she notices that it is already past her dinnertime. Before she logs out, she asks Lisbeth if Absolute Sword could be an SAO survivor. Lisbeth replies that she asked Kirito what he thought about Absolute Sword after battling him or her; he replied that the player could not have been an SAO survivor, as his Dual Blades skill would have been given to him or her instead of him.\nSource: Wikipedia",

She then reveals that she has hired a personal tutor for her so she could speed up her education, and that she was given an application for an oriented high school that would be able to efficiently teach her in order for her to go to college at a faster rate. Asuna also realizes that Kyouko investigated Kazuto; Kyouko objects to their relationship. Asuna abruptly leaves, but not before insulting her mother. In her room, Asuna laments about how she wanted to stay by Kazuto`s side and the fact that, while she may have been powerful in SAO, she was powerless in the real world. The next day, Asuna meets with Kirito on the 24th Floor of New Aincrad, and Kirito shares his impressions of Absolute Sword. Leafa, Lisbeth, and Silica then arrive and remind them that Asuna had a duel to get to. At the island, Asuna discovers that Absolute Sword was actually a girl named Yuuki. Asuna challenges Yuuki and finds out how skillful she is. During the duel, Asuna tries activating a rapier Sword Skill, Quadruple Pain, but Yuuki manages to block her attacks and then activates her own Sword Skill. Suffering heavy blows, Asuna activates her Original Sword Skill, Starry Tear. However, while she had used up her last attack, Yuuki`s Sword Skill is continuous. However, before she could defeat Asuna, Yuuki stops her assault, then states that she was satisfied with the duel. Yuuki then takes Asuna to Aincrad, where she asks for her help.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Siune explains that the group wanted to defeat the boss in order to etch their names on the Monument of Swordsmen, as they would not be able to adventure together after winter. After some thinking, Asuna agrees to help. Sometime later, while she is walking to the Teleport Gate plaza, Kyouko disconnects Asuna from the game and they have a disagreement.

The next day, she meets up with the Sleeping Knights and they easily manage to reach the boss room, but Asuna detects several other players hiding near there. Though the players claim they are waiting for their friends, Asuna realizes they were actually spying on their battle to study the boss without sacrificing their own men.

As the guild rejects the request of the Sleeping Knights to let them try again, Yuuki declares that they would fight it out, and attacks the raid group`s leader. At that point, the rest of the raid party arrives, but Kirito appears, having followed them, and blocks their path.\nSource: Wikipedia",

She responds that Yuuki was trying to avoid Asuna for her own sake, then asks Asuna to forget about the Sleeping Knights before logging out. At school, Asuna meets up with Kazuto, who gives her the address to a hospital where a medical FullDive machine, the Medicuboid, was being tested. At the hospital, Asuna meets Doctor Kurahashi, Yuuki`s supervisor, who explains the Medicuboid`s usage for patients in terminal care. Kurahashi then reveals that Yuuki was suffering from AIDS due to an infection via blood transfusion during complicated labor. After Asuna asks why Yuuki started using the Medicuboid, Kurahashi explains that he had her put in a clean room at his own request so she would not risk further infection, and reveals that Yuuki had been living inside the machine for three years straight, not returning to the real world at all. Asuna then learns about Yuuki`s elder twin sister, who passed away the year before, causing her to break down in tears. Seeing this, Yuuki communicates with Asuna via the Medicuboid, asking her to meet at the place where they first met in ALO. Asuna uses the AmuSphere in the next room to log into the game and rushes to Yuuki`s location. There, the two talk, during which Yuuki expresses her wish of going to school again.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "On the day after Asuna`s reunion with Yuuki, Asuna takes a Bidirectional Communication Probe to guide Yuuki around the school. Yuuki takes part in the lectures and becomes popular with her classmates. Afterwards, Asuna takes Yuuki to the old Konno residence, which Yuuki reveals is about to be torn down soon, so she wished to see it for one last time. She then admits that by seeing her house she realized how her mother had been surrounding her with her feelings. Asuna tells Yuuki about her relationship with her own mother and asks Yuuki how to be as strong as her. However, Yuuki claims that she was not strong, but instead, she did not feel like she had time to waste, so she would always be honest with her feelings. She then recommends Asuna to talk with her mother and share what she felt. Using Yuuki`s advice, Asuna asks Kyouko to log into ALO with her so she could show it to her. Kyouko reluctantly agrees and uses Asuna`s sub account to log in. At the Forest House, Kyouko is reminded of her parents` home. Asuna then tells her mother about how happy her parents were of her and how they wished to protect their home so Kyouko would have a place to return to. Asuna then says that she realized how life was not about just doing things for oneself and how the happiness of others could make one happy as well, thus she wanted to remain in her current school where she could support the ones she loved. The next morning, Kyouko tells Asuna that if she planned to support someone, she had to be strong herself, thus she would have to work hard on her grades to get into a university and whether Asuna would have to transfer would depend on her progress.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Three days after Yuuki Asuna talked with her mother, Asuna held a barbecue at the Forest House. During the barbecue, Jun brought up that they could beat the 28th Floor Boss. The enthusiastic group decided to take a tour through the 28th Floor Labyrinth, where they ended up beating the boss.\nOver the following months: Konno Yuuki continued to attend classes at the SAO Survivor School; the fairies had a race in Alfheim; the Sleeping Knights and Asuna defeated the 29th Floor boss; a swordsmanship tournament was held in ALfheim Online which Yuuki won after a fierce battle with Kirito; Asuna kept her promise and worked hard on her grades; Asuna organised a trip to Kyoto, with all the members of the Sleeping Knights using Kazuto`s probe to take part in the trip.\nHowever, near the end of March, Asuna received a message from Doctor Kurahashi that Yuuki`s condition was worsening. Asuna rushed over to the hospital, but found out that Yuuki`s condition was critical and that nothing more could be done. While holding Yuuki`s hand, Asuna realised that Yuuki wanted to return to the virtual world, thus she asked Kurahashi to allow her to FullDive. On the 24th Floor, at the island where Asuna and Yuuki first met, Yuuki created a scroll for her Original Sword Skill and passed it to Asuna, in hopes that it would protect her. Just then, the members of the Sleeping Knights arrived to cheer Yuuki in her final moments. The Sleeping Knights were followed by Kirito, Klein, Leafa, Lisbeth, Silica, Sinon, and Yui. Finally, a large group of fairies of various races gathered at the island, and Asuna revealed that she had notified everyone so that Yuuki would not have a lonely farewell. Yuuki then told Asuna how she had always asked herself what was the reason for her living if she was destined to die anyway, but then said that she had found the reason, as her last moments were truly fulfilling. After Asuna promised to meet her in another world, Yuuki peacefully passed away.\nA week later, at Yuuki`s memorial, Asuna met with Siune, whose condition was improving. After they talked about Yuuki, Kazuto and doctor Kurahashi joined their conversation. As Kazuto and Kurahashi explained that they were talking about Kazuto`s probe`s application for medical FullDive technology, Asuna asked about the tests for the Medicuboid. Kurahashi revealed that Yuuki had provided more than enough data, and claimed that Yuuki should get a reward like the person who provided the initial designs. As Asuna was surprised that the Medicuboid designs came from an external helper, Kurahashi revealed that the helper was professor Koujiro Rinko. The shocked Kazuto then revealed that Rinko was the person who took care of http://anidb.net/ch43412 [Kayaba Akihiko] during the SAO incident, thus the Medicuboid designs actually came from Akihiko.\nSome time later, the group had a picnic.\nSource: Wikipedia",
