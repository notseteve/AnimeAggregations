With this encounter, the Guardian Characters (including Daichi) decide to go on a quest to find the Embryo. Meanwhile, the workers of Easter are continuing their efforts to obtain the Embryo. They try to put a tracker on Ikuto to follow his movements, but he notices and places it on Yoru for comedic effect. Eventually, the quest of the Guardian Characters leads them to the worker`s place. Su, who had separated from the group, met up with Amu and the others and lead them to where the Guardian Characters are. They discovered an X Egg, and Amu Character Transformed to Amulet Clover to purify it. At the end, Ikuto throws back the tracker to Kazuomi and walks away.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Later, the Guardians (including Kukai) meet up in a place to hang out when Amu receives a message to be somewhere, which turns out to be a trap. Ikuto overhears this and rescues Amu. Meanwhile, hundreds of X Eggs inside UFO-shaped containers are scanning a large area in search for the Embryo. After Amu rejoins the group, they all Character Transform and attack. After the X Eggs are purified, the Embryo is seen floating, and both Amu and Ikuto head toward it. Via laptop, Kazuomi tells the Easter workers in the helicopter to get the Embryo, and one of them accidentally presses a giant red button that launches a missile. Ikuto blocks it, but is harmed from the blast and falls down holding Amu. Kukai and Tadase rescue them both, and Ikuto leaves grinning.\nSource: crunchyroll",
