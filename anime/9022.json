  "description" : "Dr. http://anidb.net/ch41969 [Jeredy Suno] has always been obsessed with science. His insatiable appetite for research led to an earth-shattering breakthrough, the discovery of http://anidb.net/ch41984 [Monsuno].\nThe encapsulated, controllable power, which Jeredy intended to be used for the benefit of mankind, quickly proved to hold both positive and negative potential. In the hands of good, Monsuno could be constructive, but in the hands of bad, it would be destructive. Before Jeredy is able to organize the chaos, however, he goes mysteriously missing.\nHis son http://anidb.net/ch41968 [Chase], along with his friends http://anidb.net/ch48662 [Vicki] and http://anidb.net/ch41970 [Bren], begin to search for him. During their search, they reach his lab and become involved with Monsuno. A military organization known as http://anidb.net/ch41976 [S.T.O.R.M.] seeks access to the Monsuno, but Chase, choosing to side with his father`s work, denies them that access and escapes.\nThe three are now on the run from S.T.O.R.M. while still looking for Chase`s father. However, a mysterious organization also has his eyes set on Chase and their Monsuno.\nNote: This is an American-Japanese production with the series first premiering in the United States (in Japan the series began on October 3, 2012).",
