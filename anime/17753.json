  "description" : "Totsuko is a high-school student who attends a Christian Academy in Nagasaki and can see the hearts of people as colors. Whether they`re happy colors, sad colors, peaceful colors, frightened colors... In order to not darken her friend`s and family`s \"colors,\" Totsuko is careful to read the room and stretches the truth to keep them all brightly colored. Totsuko then meets a beautiful girl who radiates very striking colors and a boy who loves music in a used bookstore in the corner of town. The three come together and form a band to make the music of their adolescence.\nSource: Crunchyroll News",
