So now, Yoichi must leave the tranquillity of his remote rural mountain life and move to the city to live with the family of his father`s friend. And if learning how to cope with city life was not hard enough, he finds himself living with four beautiful sisters, having to endure a `training` regiment more severe than he could ever have imagined.",

After he manages to best his father one last time he is told to go out into the city and learn what he can there. The father sends a message to their distant relatives the Ikarugas who run a dojo in the city, and Yoichi is told to meet with them.\nThe modern world is baffling to the young samurai, who quickly gets into trouble as he goes through a shopping mall trying to find the Ikarugas. He beats up an arrogant punk who mocks his anachronistic appearance and chases down a thief, causing no small disturbance in the process. While doing this he runs into two of the Ikaruga sisters under somewhat compromising circumstances, but helps lost Kagome find Ibuki. He is arrested by the police but later released after apologising to everyone inconvenienced, as he is seen to be good-hearted. After Ibuki brings him home, the other Ikaruga sisters are surprised to see him.",

When they get home Yoichi is struck by a sudden fever from the stress of trying to adjust so quickly to the modern world, and Ibuki goes out to get some groceries. Meanwhile, in uncharacteristic kindness Ayame tries to make rice porridge for him, which she does with Kagome`s help.

One day, as Tsubasa is leaving school with Yoichi and Ibuki, Angela rips off her clothes, turning her into a deadly martial artist in a trance-like state due to her embarrassment, and so she attacks Yoichi. Before the fight escalates further Washizu interrupts, causing Tsubasa to break out of her trance and flee crying from embarrassment, and she resents Angela as a result.\nLater that evening Angela herself attacks Yoichi, and tells her the reasons why she is trying to kill him, but he convinces her that is the wrong way, and that the pride they have in their art is the important thing.

Ayame comes by to deliver ramen for lunch and is shocked to see the two of them in an intimate pose, and so leaves without collecting payment.\nA group of delinquents called Skull Union who were once beaten by Washizu see how he seems to have softened up since their defeat, and think that it is their opportunity to take him down. They enter the dojo and abduct Ayame, and while keeping her hostage they try to beat him up. He is unable to resist for Ayame`s sake, but eventually Yoichi comes by and frees her, and the two of them together manage to defeat the delinquents.",

After getting beaten down Washizu washes his face at the pump with Torigaya, and decides to stop being so wishy-washy and declares his love for Ikaruga aloud. He meant Ibuki of course, but it is Ayame who hears him and misinterprets the declaration as being meant for her.\nAfterwards, Torigaya points out that Ayame is actually in love with Yoichi, and so they hatch a plan at the upcoming summer festival to pair Ibuki with Washizu, Ayame with Yoichi, while Torigaya accompanies Chihaya and Kagome. The plan goes awry when Torigaya mistakenly switches the pairs, leaving Ibuki with Yoichi and Ayame with Washizu.\nThe mysterious masked man who has been trying to kill Yoichi, Saginomiya Ukyou, and his sister Sakon, appear at the festival. Ukyou is seen to have an obsession with Ibuki, and Sakon hatches a plan to send Yoichi and the Ikarugas to a hot spring resort they control.",

He meets Ukyou in the spring, who tells him how he is only causing trouble for the sisters and hasn`t really done anything for them. After dinner, the proprietress of the hot spring inn tells them of how there was a haunted cave behind the inn whose ghosts were frightening the guests. Yoichi and Ibuki go to investigate, belatedly followed by Ayame. The proprietress, who is really Sakon in disguise, drugs Chihaya and Kagome, so they fall asleep.\nAt the cave, Yoichi and Ibuki fall into a pit trap and are separated, and he sees what appears to be Ayame, who sets out to aggressively seduce him. The facts that she is behaving so substantially out of character and that her breasts are larger than he remembers tip him off, and he believes that she is a ghost attempting to deceive him. The false Ayame is again Sakon in disguise, and when Ibuki eventually finds them, she drugs the two of them, and so she and Ukyou manage to abduct Ibuki.\nWhen Yoichi can move again he returns to the inn and is attacked by many of their former enemies and a large number of Saginomiya henchmen. The real Ayame joins him and helps him fight, and they rescue Chihaya and Kagome. They later find Ibuki, who seems to have lost her memories.",

As such, she remembers Ayame and Chihaya but does not quite recognise them, but does not know Kagome at all, as she was not yet born when Ibuki was four, which breaks Kagome`s heart. The sisters find that Ibuki is incredibly immature, completely different from the strong elder sister they had come to rely upon.\nAyame later scolds Ibuki for accidentally throwing a scissors at Chihaya, which makes her cry and she runs outside, where she sees Washizu, who doesn`t quite understand why she is behaving so strangely, but he brings her to a playground and plays with her as she asks. The Saginomiya siblings visit, and they explain what had been done to Ibuki, saying that the drug used on her brought her mind back to the age when she was happiest, implying that she felt that caring for her sisters has been a painful burden for her. Ukyou tries to convince them to let him take Ibuki, and provides them with wealth and a comfortable lifestyle as compensation, and even offers Yoichi a place at the soon to be revived Tsubame Ben-Ten Dojo with Angela and Tsubasa, which he will provide with the necessary funding.\nEveryone is tempted to consider the offer. However, Ukyou has one of his servants abduct Ibuki from Washizu, and Sakon lets on that her drugs brought Ibuki back to the mental age of four because that was what Ukyou specified. They very nearly accept the offers but Kagome`s sadness at being forgotten convinces them otherwise, and they go to the Saginomiya mansion to try to rescue Ibuki.",
