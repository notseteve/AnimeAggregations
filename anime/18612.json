By a twist of fate, he returns to Japan and starts living with the Mine family, who are connected to his father, http://anidb.net/ch144755 [Kenjuurou]. Yaiba constantly baffles the Mines` daughter http://anidb.net/ch10597 [Sayaka] as she witnesses his wild and reckless ways. One day, Yaiba tags along with Sayaka to school and has a fateful encounter with http://anidb.net/ch143250 [Onimaru Takeshi], a kendo expert. Yaiba and Onimaru repeatedly clash, and as if in response to their search for strength, two ancient powers are unleashed: the Fujinken, the Wind God`s Sword, and the Raijinken, the Thunder God`s Sword. Both supernatural blades that have jolted the world since ancient days have reawakened...and the truth behind them is revealed!\nSource: Official Website\nNote: The first episode received an early screening at a special event on 2 March 2025 at United Cinamas Toyosu.
