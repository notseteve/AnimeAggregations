Long hair, curved gait, he is not really what one could call a beauty canon, nor even a person you want to dwell on... He shyly confesses to the girl he loves, the beautiful and sparkling http://anidb.net/ch138185 [Tanaka], an inveterate otaku who only has eyes for the characters in her games. However, she simply declines his feelings...\nThe next morning, Murai comes back to school transformed from head to toe. He has dyed and cut his hair and now wears the style of Tanaka`s favourite character! Murai will do everything to seduce her and attract her attention!\nSource: M-U",
