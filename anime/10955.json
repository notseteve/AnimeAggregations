Shiraishi comes by delivering the class journal, and Yamada is admonished to be more serious about his studies just as she is. Later, he passes Shiraishi on the stairs, and as they glare at each other contemptuously, he trips, falling down on her. When Yamada comes to he is in the infirmary, and he finds that he is in Shiraishi`s body. Eventually he finds Shiraishi who is likewise in his body, and they agree to meet after school to try to do something to return to their own bodies. During the school day as Shiraishi, Yamada learns that the beautiful honour student`s life is not without its problems, as she`s being bullied. While he is still in her body he gets it into his mind to help stop people from bullying her. He tries to attack one of the bullies, making as if to punch her but intending to stop just short of hitting her, but Shiraishi in his body interposes himself and gets punched instead. This is enough, however, to make the bullies believe Shiraishi is no longer to be trifled with. They attempt to return to their bodies by falling down the stairs as before, but this doesn`t work, but eventually they figure out that the body swap is effected by a kiss. They attempt to use this strange power to their advantage, but one of the student council vice presidents, Miyamura, figures out what they are up to. It turns out they can swap bodies with anyone, and he provides them with access to the former Supernatural Studies club room. A girl appears in the club room, asking if the club has been reformed and requesting to join.",

She turns out to have a bit of a mania about supernatural phenomena and produces a lot of junk that are supposedly supernatural artefacts. Her presence puts a bit of a damper on Yamada and Shiraishi`s plans  to use the club room as a secret place to perform their body swapping. Eventually, however, she catches Yamada and Shiraishi kiss, and infuriated, she begins to spread rumours around the school that the two of them are dating. In an attempt to undo the damage, he tells Itou the truth about the body swap power, and performs it on her to prove it. It turns out that Itou is known for spreading tall tales and no one really believed her. It turns out that she left the school in Yamada`s body in an attempt to intimidate the punks who duped her into buying the fake supernatural artefacts, but it turns out that even in Yamada`s body she is unable to fight them off. Yamada shows up in her body and manages to beat up the punks. This earns him Itou`s gratitude, and her fascination at experiencing a true supernatural phenomenon.

      "description" : "The student council has asked the Supernatural Research Club to investigate incidents of first-year students embroiled in trouble, which they believe to be caused by yet another witch, Takigawa Noa, who seems to have the power to see the past of those she kisses. Yamada has difficulty reaching her at first, but she perks up immediately when the topic of the witches comes up, which makes him very suspicious. As it seems that the powers of the witches are inherited by students who are troubled in some way, Takigawa`s plan seems to be to make her friends obtain these powers by making them similarly troubled and removing the present set of witches.\nTakigawa`s group attempts to get Shiraishi expelled by using her body swap powers against her and causing trouble while in her body, but the Club is one step ahead. Takigawa`s friend winds up swapping bodies with Yamada in Shiraishi`s body, who overpowers her companions. After they negotiate with Takigawa to release her friends, Yamada confronts her and he finds her power is to see traumatic events in the past of a person she kisses. He learns that her friends were framed for the troubles they found themselves in, and were disgraced as a result. Ultimately he convinces her to stop with her plans as he promises to help them to regain their original status.",

Sarushima tells Yamada that she doesn`t like having her powers of prognostication as she wants to fall in love, and wonders if there is a way to remove a witch`s powers. They learn of Tamaki Shinichi, who has the ability to steal a witch`s powers. He already took the power of invisibility from the witch Asuka Mikoto. He bargains with Yamada, getting him to look into the future to see who will become next student council president, as he has sights on the position himself. The student council president says that he will appoint as his successor whoever is able to identify the seventh and final witch.\nYamada kisses Sarushima again and sees a vision of the future where Tamaki becomes president after taking Sarushima`s powers and he has Shiraishi as his secretary. This vision of Shiraishi as sad and lonely as she once had been disturbs Yamada so much that he begins the hunt for the mysterious Seventh Witch in earnest. Yamada confesses to Miyamura that he has fallen in love with and doesn`t want to see her that way ever again.",

Miyamura introduces the club to his sister, Leona, who dropped out of school, terrified of the Seventh Witch`s powers to make people forget everything about the witches.\nYamada later meets the Seventh Witch, Saionji Rika, whose powers seem not to require a kiss. He seems unaffected, and still seems to remember everything. He returns to the Supernatural Research Club and is shocked to find that Saionji`s powers have instead affected everyone else, and because they knew him only from their work with the witches, they have all, including Shiraishi, forgotten about him.

The next day he runs into Odagiri who now seems to remember everything: Yamada can undo Saionji`s powers on the witches by kissing them. Saionji meets up with Yamada again, and tells him that the reason the Seventh Witch`s name is kept secret is because if one can gather all the witches together any wish can be granted by performing a special ritual.\nSaionji`s powers fail to affect Odagiri a second time, so Yamazaki tries to take more drastic measures. He has the student council issue a warning about a \"kissing bandit\" in the school, which makes Yamada`s attempts at restoring the memories of the other witches harder. He offers Odagiri a deal, noting that she has truly fallen in love with Yamada herself, that he would make her wish come true if she hindered Yamada`s plans. She refuses, knowing that she would never be able to compel Yamada`s love that way, that he would always be looking at Shiraishi. He then sends out notices to all the witches to gather at a certain place and time: he is attempting to perform the wish-granting ritual. Yamada then has to perform the ritual himself before Yamazaki.\nTamaki and Odagiri try to find Saionji and convince her to help, but she refuses, and hints that Yamazaki may be planning to perform the ceremony to eliminate Yamada altogether. Despite Yamazaki`s efforts Yamada is able to get to Ootsuka, Sarushima, and Takigawa. He tries to reach Shiraishi and finds that Yamazaki has gotten to her first, and it is Asuka Mikoto in her body.",
