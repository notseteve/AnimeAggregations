Then one day, she meets her match: http://anidb.net/ch1966 [Arima Souichirou], who seems about as perfect as she strives to be. But no one is quite what they seem... for whenever Yukino goes home, off comes the ojou-sama (princess) façade — and on go the headbands, reading glasses, and sweats. Miss Congeniality is in fact a conniving, petty con-artist with a streak of absolute nerdy bliss. Of course, Yukino is not the only one hiding a secret, since Arima himself is not quite what he seems to be either.\nIn her eagerness to become number one, she declares Arima as her arch-enemy, but then he declares his love for her...",

A handsome boy who entered the school at the top of the entrance exams, he steals Yukino`s place as class representative, and steadily encroaches on her popularity in class.
