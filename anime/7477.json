Several years after the end of the war, a crime organization called Vischio has taken control of the destroyed city of Toshima (formerly Tokyo, Japan`s capital city), where they are holding a battle game known as Igura. The game`s main character, a young man named http://anidb.net/ch18464 [Akira], is falsely accused of a crime. Once arrested, a mysterious woman appears before him, offering him freedom if he agrees to participate in Igura and defeat Igura`s strongest man: the king, or Il-re. The story follows Akira`s life in the harsh, lawless Toshima as he fights both to survive and to unravel the mysteries developing around him.\nNote: The first episode was streamed online on NicoNico Douga and U-stream as part of a special preview event on September 23, 2010. The regular television broadcast started on October 8, 2010.",

He`s awakened from sleep when a group of police break into his room and pin the blame for a recent murder on him, a crime which carries a sentence of life imprisonment. With no way to defend himself against the charges, Akira waits in fear for his life. He`s visited in jail by a woman named Emma who offers him the only alternative to a life spent in captivity - join a higher-stakes fighting competition, and defeat the man at the top. Faced with no other option, Akira gathers his things and leaves for the city of Toshima, where the Igura competition is held. He has nothing more than the clothes on his back and the dog tags that peg him as a participant, so when some thugs show up to harass him and take a hit of a drug giving them super powers, he has little recourse. He`s only saved by a man dressed in black, who brutally murders his attackers with his sword. The man threatens Akira as well, only letting him leave with his life when Akira shows too much pride to beg for his life.",
