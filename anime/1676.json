  "description" : "During the summer break, Gash and the others went on a picnic to Mt. Fuji, there they met a girl named Kotoha who owned a white magicial book in which prophecys would come true. When Gash looked into the book, a prophecy appeared and said \"Gash`s mother will be waiting in the cave in the wods\". However it was a boy named Wiseman that was in the cave waiting for him, he asked them to help him get out of the cave. They agreed to help him, but the cave led to the magical world. Then, Black Knight who was the strongest warrior of the magical world appeared in front of them. Black Knight thought that they had stolen the 101st magical book, and he attacked them.\nThey wondered why 101st book existed although there must be 100 persons who should complete for the next king.\nWhile they were surprised, they knew another surprising truth; if they stay in magical world more than 24 hours, they wouldn`t be able to go back to the human world again.\nOn the other hand, Wiseman who escaped from the cave rushed to Kotoha with a fearless smile.\nSource: Animenfo",
