In the past, the black-and-silver winged Bahamut has threatened to destroy the land, but humans, gods, and demons overcame their differences to fight together and seal its power. The key to that seal was split in two, one half given to the gods and the other to demons, so that they would never be united and Bahamut never released. Now, two thousand years later, the world is in an era of peace - until the day a human woman steals the gods` half of the key.\nSource: ANN",

A long battle and chase that span across the town of Wytearp ends when Favaro Leone the bounty hunter escapes the grasp of Kaisar Lidfald, a disgraced knight who suffered humiliation by Favaro. After successfully tracking down and killing a criminal who summons demons, Favaro collects his bounty and celebrates at the local town`s tavern. While Favaro brags about his feats, a mysterious woman overhears him boasting about knowing how to get to Helheim quickly. She then confronts Favaro outside and demands directions to Helheim. The discussion is cut short when the criminal`s younger brother appears. Favaro underestimates the brother`s summoned demon and is overwhelmed only to be saved by the mysterious woman who reveals powers that like a demon. She easily overwhelms the demon while Favaro takes out the brother criminal. Busy gloating Favaro is caught in the way of debris and he passes out as the demon woman draws closer, appearing to kiss him. Favaro then awakens at an inn, thinking it all a dream only to find himself suddenly declared a \"demon\" and he has grown a tail.\nSource: Wikipedia",

After no success the mysterious woman from the night before appears, declaring she placed a spell on Favaro; until Favaro tells her the shortcut to Helhiem, she will not undo the spell as it is a contract. Since Favaro lied he declares he has to show the woman the way and they leave town. Later in town the Knights of Jeanne D`Arc appear, declaring they are searching for a demon. Kaiser, thinking it to be Favaro, declares he will capture and deliver it as he is a knight himself. He is quickly dismissed due to his bounty hunter band though he protests he was forced to become one after his family fell to ruin, something he blames Favaro for. With Favaro the demon woman, named Amira, she is looking for her mother who is in Helhiem. As Favaro contemplates killing Amira to free himself of the spell Kaisar appears, declaring Favaro a demon and guilty of kidnapping Amira, only to be knocked out by Favaro and the two escape again. In the next town the Knights appear, saying they`re looking for a female demon with one wing; Favaro who is alone seizes his chance by selling out Amira. The Knights chase Amira while Favaro hopes them killing her will release the spell. However he is forced back together with Amira; seeing she`s unharmed the two run from the knights who chase them to a bridge. The two tumble down into the river below and out of the knights` sight. Amira then asks Favaro if he is a liar and he protests, asking if his face looks that of a liar only to make a goofy devious expression.\nSource: Wikipedia",

The trio arrive in Prudisia while Favaro is troubled by what the dragon told him: Should Amira ever be close to Bahamut, she`ll fuse with it permanently due to her god and demon blood as only a human vessel can maintain the seal; only the way to prevent the fusing is to kill Amira.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Rita escapes from the castle after being confronted by a suspicious cloaked man who threatens to dispose of her. Meanwhile the King proceeds with Jeanne D`Arc`s death sentence for deceit and conspiracy carried out before a crowd of protestors who proclaim her innocence. As Jeanne burns she faces fiery visions of the gods forsaking her, including her patron angel, causing her to accept the words of the cloaked demon. Jeanne is converted from a saint into a witch by the demon and she escapes the capital by wielding a fierce and dark power as she is now a demon. Meanwhile Favaro thinks over the dragon`s words of killing Amira as the trio continues their journey to find Amira`s mother. They are intercepted by the cloaked man who is the same demon who tricked the king as well as Jeanne; Amira reveals him to be her mentor Martinet who in turn tells them they are in Helheim. Rita seeks out Bacchus and inquires about Martinet but the two run into a severely injured Azazel. The demon lord Beelzebub appears before the trio, capturing Kaisar and Favaro, telling Amira to fulfill her purpose before showing her mother. Martinet reveals in actually Beezlebub recreated Amira from Nicole as an imitation vessel and he is her \"true\" birth parent as all Amira`s memories are fabricated since as she is a mere tool to release Bahamut. Amira`s compromised emotional state causes the key`s seal to unlock, falling into the demon`s hands as the completed Transcendent Key. Azazel agrees to help Rita if she takes him to Abos while Favaro pretends to join the demons but Martient sees through the plan and forcibly makes Favaro a demon.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "With Favaro transformed into a demon, he is now under their control. Beezlebub and Martient prepare Amira for transportation but not before blasting Kaisar away to fall into the depths below. The god clan attempt to maintain the seal on Bahamut but sense the presence of the Transcendent Key now that it is formed. Meanwhile Azazel converses with Rita and Bacchus, revealing that Beezlebub is the one behind Amira`s actions as well Martinet; Rita theorizes Martient is not a demon like Beezlebub. While protecting the seal the angels are attacked by the corrupted Jeanne who slays Raphael and Uriel before going after Michael. Kaisar is saved by Bacchus in his flying carriage only to be attacked by Jeanne. While Bacchus fights Jeanne, Rita gives Kaisar a cure she made for the demon transformation and he taunts Azazel into helping him. Rita attempts to administer the last of the antidotes to Jeanne but fails only for Michael to successfully give it to Jeanne through a kiss after she impales him. Jeanne is freed, turning back into a saint while Michael`s physical form disappears and he reassures her the world needs her. As Beezlebub prepares to destroy the angels protecting Bahamut`s barrier Azazel attacks him and engages in battle for revenge. Kaisar duels with the demonic Favaro and upon seeing how he`s become a true demon shoots him in the chest. Amira emerges from the Transcendent Key`s orb, now with angel`s wings. Lavalley appears before Kaisar, only for Rita to warn to get way from the knight. With the barrier fallen Bahamut beings to absorb Amira while everyone looks on helplessly; as Kaisar watches in disbelief Lavalley shoves him over the edge of the flying fortress before reveling in Bahamut`s awakening.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Beelzebub declares the war between demons and gods over with Bahamut`s awakening as he is its master, and commands the gods to bow before him. He then orders the great dragon to unleash its power to which it attacks Beelzebub before proceeding to blast everything in sight. Rita manages to save Kaisar and reveals that Lavalley is really, Gilles de Rais, a sorcerer with a bounty who is the one behind Bahamut`s revival as well as all the deception. The demons and gods team up to fight against the uncontrollable Bahamut. Kaisar attempts to attack Lavalley only to find they have no effect before Lavalley reveals he is Martient as well. Elsewhere a heavily wounded Beelzebub curses Martient`s deception of using Amira to be able control Bahamut before Azazel finishes him off, ending his revenge. A bloody Favaro appears, revealing he`s not dead and begins combat against Kaisar seemingly by Lavalley`s command. Favaro gains the upper hand before proceeding to cut Kaisar`s hand off, presenting it with the bounty armband to Lavalley. Favaro catches Lavalley off guard by warning him about having a bounty on his head before Kaidar recites the bounty armband`s incantation thus turning Lavalley into a bounty tablet. As Rita tends to Kaisar`s wounds Favaro reveals that Kaisar managed to shoot him with the antidote, turning him back to normal and the fight was an act. As Bahamut continues to rage Favaro declares it`s up to him to stop it and he`ll kill Amira as it`s the only way to stop the beast as well free her from sadness. Kaisar decides to join Favaro to save Amira, still believing there is a chance to separate her from Bahamut. In order keep Bahamut still for a minute the demons and gods work together to contain the beast to allow Favaro and Kaisar to approach it. With tears in his eyes Favaro screams Amira`s name as he stabs Bahamut, unleashing a beam of light. Amira then appears before him, chiding him for being late and he promises to take her somewhere better than Helheim. Amira proceeds to kiss Favaro after realizing he isn`t lying when he meets her with a serious, sincere gaze. She thanks Favaro before disappearing back inside Bahamut, causing the beast to explode though Kaisar escapes, leaving Favaro to be caught up in the blast that destroys his leg. Half a year later in the royal capital Kaisar, given a mechanical hand from Rita, commands the soldiers as a lieutenant with his knighthood intact. Favaro is alive with a mechanical right leg and is back to bounty hunting though he remarks Bahamut will never be forever gone. Kaisar then suddenly appears, forsaking his knightly duties, swearing not to be in Favaro`s debt and the two ride off.\nSource: Wikipedia",
