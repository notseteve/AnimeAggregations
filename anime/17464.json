  "description" : "* Based on a post-apocalyptic gun-action manga by http://anidb.net/cr9055 [Naitou Yasuhiro].\nOn the forbidding desert world of Gunsmoke, a mysterious bounty hangs above the head of http://anidb.net/ch4423 [Vash the Stampede], and the gunslinging pacifist can`t seem to find a moment`s respite. Vash is no ordinary pistolero, packing a weapon capable of punching holes in a planet, which explains why the locals tremble at the very mention of his name. But sixty billion double dollars is no ordinary reward, and every trigger-happy psycho in creation is aiming to claim Vash dead or alive—preferably dead!\nSource: Dark Horse\nNote: The first episode received an early screening on November 19, 2022 at Anime NYC in the United States and at a special event on December 3, 2022 at Human Trust Cinema Shibuya in Tokyo, Japan. Further, the first three episodes received an early screening at a special event on December 30, 2022 at Shinjuku Wald 9 in Tokyo and Umeda Burg 7 in Osaka.
