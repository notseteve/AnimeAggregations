From the gate pour out monsters, knights from middle-age Europe and other fantasy-like beings, and they kill many citizens of Tokyo. This event is known as the Ginza Incident.

Led by otaku soldier http://anidb.net/ch73921 [Itami Youji], they find that the villages in the world are being attacked by a dragon.

This is, however, actually a gambit by Emperor Molt to weaken the kingdoms that are only nominally under his authority and keep them from rebelling. With their armies largely destroyed they are unable to resist his subsequent scorched-earth tactics. The emperor`s daughter, Pinya, is ordered to lead her order of knights to investigate the JSDF and learn all she can about them.\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, the President of the United States considers sending an American force beyond the Gate as well, lured by the prospect of immense resources in the lands beyond, despite the political implications. Domestic opposition in Japan to the JSDF`s operation beyond the Gate is mounting as well, so the President is convinced to bide his time.\nYouji is made commander of a reconnaissance unit whose job is to make contact with the locals and establish friendly relations with them. Along the way, they find a dragon burning a village. When they reach it after the dragon leaves, they find a woman at the bottom of a well, apparently the only survivor.",

Youji asks the mayor what happened to the lord who ostensibly ruled over their lands and why he wasn`t doing anything to help with the dragon, and was told that their lord never returned from the last battle near the Gate.\nWhile the Platoon helps guide the villagers away from the dragon a group of bandits thinks to attack them and in so doing become their new lord. A demigoddess named Rory Mercury slaughters them without mercy. The next morning she meets with the village and the Platoon, and seems to take a liking to Youji.\nSoon enough, the dragon attacks them, and kills a sizeable number of villagers. Even modern weapons are at first ineffective against the dragon, until the elfmaid and Rory help the platoon to injure it badly enough that it is driven off.\nAfter the villagers bury their dead, most of them are able to settle in other villages where they have kin.

His decision to do this stirs up controversy in the upper ranks. The girl Leilei proves able to learn Japanese rather quickly and becomes interpreter. They are fascinated by modern technology but are concerned that they must find a way to repay all the help they are being given. They see a battlefield full of dead dragons killed by the JSDF during the last battle, and attempt to harvest the dragon scales and trade them at the nearby city of Italica.\nAt the same time, Pinya travels throughout the lands and hears stories of the doings of the JSDF from some of the survivors of Coda Village. She finds one of the imperial vassal kings, badly maimed after the battle at Arnus Hill, who tells her of the slaughter and how he realises how they had been used by the Emperor. She resolves to visit Arnus Hill and see these invaders for herself. They also have to pass through Italica to get there.\nMeanwhile, back on Earth, the President of the People`s Republic of China makes plans to colonise the land beyond the Gate as well. Garbled reports of the incidents involving Youji`s unit serve to make a public relations nightmare for the Japanese government, and the exploration of the land beyond the Gate continues to lose popular support.

This is Pina`s first true battle: her Knights were relegated solely to a ceremonial role before, and she is not doing well. She had Itami`s platoon guard the south gates, as they are the most difficult to defend, but that night the bandits unexpectedly attack the east gate and overwhelm their defences. She thinks of calling Itami to help but fears he will not come after having put him in what looked like a suicidal position. It seems though that Itami will help of his own initiative.",

This awesome display of modern military firepower leaves Pina in a state of shock, and she realises that a war with them would result in their inevitable defeat.

      "description" : "The Rose Knights treat Itami very roughly as they bring him back to Italica, so much so that he is knocked unconscious. Pinya is livid, as they have then violated the treaty so soon after it had been agreed upon and she fears that the JSDF will use the incident as a pretext to attack, so she orders Bozes Co Palesti to make it up to Itami with her body. In the meantime, Itami`s platoon sneaks into the city in an attempt to rescue him, to find that he is being well cared for by several semi-human maids and they have a small party. Bozes arrives and slaps Itami after she sees that he seems to be having fun.\nPinya and Bozes join Itami`s group as they return to the camp at Arnus Hill, and along the way they see further evidence of the JSDF`s overwhelming military might as they conduct a training exercise. Pinya speaks to General Hazuma, the commanding general of the JSDF forces at Arnus Hill, apologising for the incident. The next day, she joins Leilei, Tuka, and Rory as part of the delegation from beyond the Gate for the audience with the Diet of Japan.",

      "description" : "The five girls from the Special Region pass through the Gate with Itami`s unit, and are astounded by modern Tokyo. A Public Safety intelligence officer named Komakado meets them and escorts the group to the Diet. Pinya and Bozes are not part of the official delegation and attend a private meeting with cabinet officials in preparation for a possible future peace conference with the Empire. At the same time, Leilei, Tuka, and Rory are brought before the Diet into what becomes a sensational public hearing. Some members of the Diet opposed to the JSDF`s operations beyond the Gate try to paint Itami`s attempt to save the villagers from the dragon into a bad light, but the three girls are having none of it, and stress that the lieutenant did the best he could under such difficult circumstances, and in so doing humiliate their spokeswoman.\nKomakado is concerned about possible attempts on the Special Region girls, and so gets them to leave the Diet using the subway rather than the cars they were expected to use, which are promptly attacked. Whoever is attempting to capture them also seems to have control over the subways as certain lines they are about to use inexplicably fail. They are attacked by a man in the street who tries to take Rory`s axe, which is incredibly heavy, which incapacitates both the attacker and Komakado who both unwisely attempt to lift it. To hide them, Itami brings the girls to the house of a famished young woman whom he introduces as his ex-wife.",

Itami brings them there as ordered, and after they are settled there is fighting just outside as several groups of enemy commandos make their way to the resort. The Japanese special forces unit manages to neutralise most of these mysterious enemy forces. However, President Dirrell blackmails the Prime Minister with reports of government corruption and convinces him to get the unit guarding the resort to withdraw, so that the American commando unit can abduct the girls from the Special Region with no interference.

Itami`s ex-wife Risa spreads the word that the girls will be heading back through the Gate that afternoon, so a large crowd gathers at Ginza to see them off.\nMeanwhile, the Prime Minister has resigned, removing the blackmail leverage that the Americans had, but the Central Intelligence Agency is still attempting to abduct the girls, planning to take them just as they arrive at Ginza, since the assurances of the previous administration should still hold. However, Komakado has arrested all the foreign intelligence agents in the area, including the CIA ones, saying that he has no way of verifying whether any such agent he finds is with the CIA or not, foiling their plans.

A dark elf woman named Yao Ha Dyusshi appears, looking for what she calls the \"green men\" (the JSDF) trying to get their help.

Yao explains her errand, but the General refuses to help. The settlements of Yao`s people can only be reached by crossing imperial territory, and if he sends enough forces there to defeat the dragon that would be interpreted by the Empire as an act of war. Frustrated in her mission, she overhears stories about Itami and how he might manage to do something to help, and so when she goes to the refugee dormitories she asks Tuka about him.\nItami meanwhile has escorted a second diplomat to join Pinya, and is being sent as part of a delegation to the capital.",
