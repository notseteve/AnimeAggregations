  "description" : "According to an ancient legend, mermaid`s flesh can grant immortality if eaten. 500 years ago, http://anidb.net/ch11559 [Yuuta] unknowingly ate a piece of mermaid`s flesh. For centuries, he travels across Japan, hoping to find a mermaid, thinking she may be able to make him a normal human again. When he finally finds one, he discovers that she and her companions have been raising a girl to be their food so they can eat her and take on her youthful looks. That is how mermaids stay young. Yuuta kills the mermaids and rescues the girl, but she has already eaten some of the mermaid`s flesh. Although he had to kill the mermaids, Yuuta isn`t too disappointed because Yuuta`s once lonely existence is now over, as he has found a companion in http://anidb.net/ch11560 [Mana]. And Mana, who had been trapped in a small hut her whole life, finds delight in even the simplest of things. Together, Yuuta and Mana attempt to seek out more mermaids, trying to become normal humans again.\nSource: ANN\nNote: The story of 1991 OVA http://anidb.net/a817 [Ningyo no Mori] (Mermaid Forest) is re-told in episodes 4-5 and the story of 1993 OVA http://anidb.net/a1300 [Ningyo no Kizu] (Mermaid`s Scar) is re-told in episodes 12-13.",

The secret the women keep, even from Mana, is that all the identical women are mermaids and that aged mermaids need to eat young immortal women to regain their youth. Yuta, an immortal human who is now 500 years-old arrives and attempts to find a mermaid. After Baba feeds the flesh of one of the mermaids to Mana, Yuta learns about their ultimate plan for Mana and tells her about it. While trying to stop Yuta and Mana from escaping, the women revert to their mermaid form and are unable to take human form again. Baba, also an immortal human, stays behind as Yuta and Mana leave. Yuta tells Mana that life as an immortal isn`t all bad, but he still hopes to become mortal again.\nSource: Wiki",

Isago, the wife of the Sakagami chief, convinces the chief to use his men to hunt mermaids. She also hires Yuta and some other men in a nearby port for the hunt. On Toba, Rin`s father is gravely ill, so Rin leads the raiding parties on passing ships, demanding a tenth of their cargo as a toll, but killing no one. Yuta, drowned in a violent storm while mermaid hunting for Isago, washes up on Toba. As Rin places flowers on Yuta`s grave the next day, he revives. For a time, Yuta lives and works with the Toba islanders. One day Isago sees Yuta and Rin in port. Surprised to see Yuta alive, Isago realizes he is immortal and believes he kept the mermaid she hired him to find. She follows them back to Toba and stabs Rin`s father, telling Rin that only mermaid flesh can stop him from dying. In retaliation, Rin kills Isago.\nSource: Wiki",

The Sakagami islanders, who followed them to sea, kill the mermaid and Yuta, taking Rin to Sakagami. Rin sees Isago there and realizes Isago is immortal. Isago reveals that she has been pregnant for three years by her previous husband, whom the Sakagami islanders killed, and that she needs mermaid flesh so she can finally give birth. A revived Yuta arrives to save Rin. The chief and his men alternately fight Yuta and Rin and eat mermaid flesh. Those who don`t die from the mermaid flesh, including the chief, become Deformed Ones. She also tells the chief that she too is a mermaid. Isago runs away and jumps off a cliff into the ocean. Yuta and Rin think Isago did it in desperation, but Isago, now in mermaid form, swims away trailed by two smaller forms. On Toba, Rin`s father recovers on his own, without mermaid flesh.

      "description" : "In the cellar, the scarred woman attacks Mana, but Mana and Nanao escape. Then the woman uses the surgical instruments to remove the skin from her face and to replace it with the unscarred face, becoming the woman Nanao thinks is his mother. Not knowing the two women are the same person, Nanao tells her where the injured Mana is hiding. As Nanao`s mother is dragging Mana to the cellar, Yuta and the older Nanao arrive. Mana throws the box with the scarred face outside, where it opens to allow Yuta to see its contents. Nanao`s mother admits that she replaced the face scarred from mermaid poison with one she got from the corpse of a woman who washed ashore. Nanao`s mother locks herself and Nanao in the cellar so the others cannot stop her from feeding him mermaid flesh. As the scar appears on her new face, she doubts that the mermaid flesh is not poison. Mana knocks the flesh from Nanao`s hands as he tries to eat it. Nanao`s mother gives him back to the older Nanao and walks off into the fog.\nSource: Wiki",

Elsewhere Yuta heard that a villager killed a nun to steal the ash, but the nun came back to life and killed many of the villagers. When Yuta leaves, Nae disappears. The village holds a funeral for her, even though there`s no body. Over the decades, Eijiro, Nae`s former fiance, buys the village land. In the present, Mana finds one of Eijiro`s men beating a girl named Nae. Nae kills the man, but two other men kill Mana. Eijiro, who keeps Nae confined on his estate, realizes Mana is immortal when she revives. Meanwhile, Sokichi, having met up with Yuta, tells Yuta that Nae is still alive unchanged and leads him to Eijiro`s house, where Eijiro`s men capture them. Nae kills some of Eijiro`s men and escapes with Mana. Eijiro orders his men to recapture Nae unharmed and to decapitate Yuta.\nSource: Wiki",

When Nae goes to the Red Valley, Eijiro kills her. Eijiro thinks he can revive Nae with mermaid ash. He cannot find it, however, because Nae hid the remaining ash to keep her father from finding out that she used it to make the Red Valley. Eijiro looks for the ash for decades and finally finds it, using it to revive Nae`s still pristine corpse in the Red Valley. In the present, Yuta and Sokichi escape Eijiro`s men. Nae leads Mana to the Red Valley, but Eijiro intercepts them. When Nae and Mana try to proceed to the Red Valley, Eijiro draws a knife and stabs Nae, critically wounding her. Nae arrives in the Red Valley and remembers that Eijiro killed her there. When Yuta arrives and goes to Nae, she dies from her wound. As they leave, Yuta asks Mana if it`s jealousy that makes her impatient with him. Mana asks Yuta if jealousy is some kind of dessert.\nSource: Wiki",
