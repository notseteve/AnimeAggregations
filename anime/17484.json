  "description" : "* Based on a manga series written and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr867 [Kurumada Masami].\nThe young warriors who protect the goddess http://anidb.net/ch33224 [Athena] are known as the Knights of the Zodiac. One young orphan, http://anidb.net/ch112631 [Seiya], is destined to become the http://anidb.net/ch30885 [Pegasus Knight]. Athena has been born into this world, but this time under a dark prophecy that she will lose the war against http://anidb.net/ch43913 [Poseidon] and http://anidb.net/ch44042 [Hades], and lead mankind to ruin. Seiya stands up against the prophecy, willing to protect her at all cost. But now a god-killer arrow has struck her heart. To save her life, Seiya must ascend Sanctuary and defeat twelve legendary Gold Knights - and he only has twelve hours to do it. Will he make it? And what will happen to the dark prophecy if he succeeds?\"\nSource: Crunchyroll",
