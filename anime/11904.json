The day of the dubbing session for the final episode has finally arrived, but sadly the trains are delayed or stopped because of the snow and Chitose is extremely late. The staff and cast members who are waiting at the studio reflect on their thoughts and feelings about Chitose. Finally, the door opens and Chitose tells them how she feels. Is her legend finally about to start here?\nSource: crunchyroll",
