  "description" : "* Based on a love comedy light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr73610 [Takata] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr73611 [Hyuuga Azuri].\nMaehara Maki is a boy who has not made any friends or acquaintances at school. He makes his first friend Asanagi Umi — whom the gossip among male classmates have nicknamed the \"second cutest girl in class.\" She usually hangs out after school with the No. 1 cutest girl, the naive Amami Yuu. However, on Fridays, Asanagi would come to Maehara`s home instead, thanks to their shared hobbies like movies, games, and manga.\nSource: ANN",
