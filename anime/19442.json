  "description" : "Lua was a saintess candidate who wielded the power of healing, but her ability had one flaw: she could only directly heal herself, and would heal others by transferring their wounds onto her own body. Because of this, others bullied her, calling her the \"Broken Saintess\". But it didn`t bother Lua, because her best friend Arianne always stood up for her.\nOne day, Lua`s crush, Commander Garrett, was on the brink of death from a beast attack. Lua healed him, which left her on the verge of death. When she woke up, she learned that all the credit was given to Arianne, who seized the opportunity to get engaged to Garrett, and she finally saw her best friend`s true colors. Devastated, Lua was lost and helpless when the second prince appeared in front of her with a tempting offer: to join him on the path of revenge.\nSource: manga via ANN (edited)",
