Because her very existence depends on her secret not being found out, every day is a new danger—to say nothing of that vampire! Meanwhile, Ruka, not knowing Mito`s a girl, dotes on her night and day in an attempt to ripen her \"disgusting male blood,\" but when real feelings develop... this dangerous romance between a crossdressing girl and an obsessive vampire begins!\nSource: Kodansha\nNote: The first two episodes received an early screening at a special event on April 6, 2024 at TOHO Cinemas Hibiya in Tokyo.
