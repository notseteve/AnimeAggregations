They are both pretty popular, and they seem to suit each other well. However, outsiders don`t know of the secret they share. Both Mugi and Hanabi have hopeless crushes on someone else, and they are only dating each other to soothe their loneliness. Mugi is in love with http://anidb.net/ch86377 [Minagawa Akane], a young teacher who used to be his home tutor. Hanabi is also in love with a teacher, http://anidb.net/ch86380 [Kanai Narumi], a young man who has been a family friend since she was little. In each other, they find a place where they can grieve for the ones they cannot have, and they share a loneliness-driven physical intimacy. Will things stay like this for them forever?\nSource: MangaHelpers\nNote: The first episode was digitally distributed by Amazon Prime Video one day before the regular TV broadcast, which started on 13.01.2017.",
