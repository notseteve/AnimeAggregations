  "description" : "Pony Metal U-GAIM is an anime that was never made. Only a promotional video of it exists.\nFrom what is known the story was supposed to be a crossover between http://anidb.net/a521 [Mahou no Tenshi Creamy Mami] and http://anidb.net/a522 [Heavy Metal L-Gaim]. The heroine, http://anidb.net/ch16534 [Morisawa Yuu], is killed in a car accident and brought back to life as a crime-fighting super robot.\nNote: What makes this pilot great is that it`s 100% http://anidb.net/cr1697 [Anime R], and was produced by Anime R at the height of its powers, so it`s packed full of Anime R goodness. Anime R`s work is mostly buried in Sunrise robot shows from the 80s that don`t get much play from fans anymore, so they`ve never received their due respect over here (though the same could be said for many great subcontractors of yore). This pilot offers a dense summation of what made Anime R great, so it`s the perfect introduction to this studio.\nSource: http://www.pelleas.net/aniTOP/index.php/pony-metal-u-gaim",
