  "description" : "One does not need dance to live.\nIn 1374, during the turbulent age when the Northern and Southern Courts were locked in conflict, the Northern Court`s shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, was becoming an increasingly dominant force. Born the son of Kan`ami, head of the Kanze troupe of sarugaku performers, http://anidb.net/ch153214 [Oniyasha] drifts through his days with a hazy question lodged in his heart: Why do people dance? His spirit remains clouded, until the day he encounters a dance that is truly \"good.\" Curious, sensitive, and strikingly beautiful, the boy meets people, laughs, cries, confronts his own weaknesses, and slowly begins to shape a new form of dance for a world steeped in impermanence.\nSource: Official Website",
