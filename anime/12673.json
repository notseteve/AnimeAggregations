  "description" : "* Based on http://anidb.net/cr26482 [Sugimoto Iqura]`s seinen manga series.\nThe last thing freshman http://anidb.net/ch87981 [Koshiyama Shiki] expected was to be asked to join the Bunzo High School New Student Fast Finger Quiz Championship. A bookwork at heart, he hates being the center of attention and shudders at the mere thought of participating. To add insult to injury, his classmate http://anidb.net/ch87980 [Fukami Mari] overwhelms her competition by pressing the buzzer even before the entire question is read. It`s too late to hit the buzzer after you know the answer. A split second is all it takes to determine who wins or loses, she declares.\nAfter observing Mari for a while, Shiki discovers a way to determine the answers to a quiz. His world expands as he meets colleagues and senior members of the Quiz Club, as well as their formidable rival http://anidb.net/ch87982 [Mikuriya Chisato]. He experiences the joys of answering correctly and the frustrations of not getting to the buzzer quickly enough. He and his colleagues hone not only their knowledge, but also various techniques as they pursue victory in the world of competitive quiz.\nSource: ANN\nNote: The first two episodes received an early screening at a special event held at United Cinemas Aqua City Odaiba in Tokyo on 02.07.2017.",
