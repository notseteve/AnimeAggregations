  "description" : "A drunken palm kills with a sword, a drunken man lies on the knees of a beautiful woman, a mad emperor is reborn against the will of heaven.\n　　Chu Kuangsheng lived in Shiyang Town, a remote town in the Shenlong Empire. He was the son of the head of the Chu family in Shiyang Town. He was born weak and unable to practice, and became a joke to the entire Shiyang Town. Three years ago, Chu Kuangsheng`s parents were away on business and their whereabouts were unknown. The sister who was supposed to succeed the head of the Chu family also suffered a strange illness. Since then, Chu Kuangsheng`s situation has become increasingly difficult. In an accident, Chu Kuangsheng inherited the Chu family`s ancestral secrets and reshaped his meridians. Since then, Chu Kuangsheng`s cultivation has progressed rapidly. On the surface, he is cowardly and incompetent, but his other identity is that he is a famous mad master in the world.\n　　Chu Kuangsheng found out that the clan’s eldest elder’s collusion with outsiders seemed to be related to the disappearance of his parents. In order not to alert others, Chu Kuangsheng used Kuangzun’s identity to secretly make friends with heroes, accumulate strength, and find out information. He had two identities with one face. After eradicating the traitors in his family, in order to find out the truth behind his parents` disappearance, Chu Kuangsheng walked out of the small town of Shiyang and went to the Four Spirits Academy to study under his master and follow the clues.\n　　Chu Kuangsheng swung his sword to cut off the enemy, fought against the heroes of the Nine Heavens, and became famous in Yu Nei. Look back again and climb back to the top. The path of calamity, the path of the gods, thousands of realms, I am the master.\nsource: movie.douban.com/googletranslate",
