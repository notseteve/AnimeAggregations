      "description" : "In the summer of 2010, self-proclaimed mad scientist Okabe Rintarou and his childhood friend Shiina Mayuri go to the Akihabara Radio Kaikan building to attend a seminar on time travel by Doctor Nakabachi. While there, Rintaro meets a girl named Makise Kurisu, who claims to have met him fifteen minutes before despite having never met her himself. Later, after receiving a scrambled video message on his phone, Rintaro hears a scream and discovers Kurisu lying in a pool of blood, indicating that she was stabbed to death. Upon sending an e-mail about the situation to his friend, Itaru \"Daru\" Hashida, Rintaro feels a strange sensation, before discovering the streets have become vacant and a strange satellite has crashed into the radio building. Later, as Rintaro`s \"Future Gadget Laboratory\" work on a phone-controlled microwave that turns bananas into gelatinous form, Rintaro is surprised to learn that the seminar he was attending was apparently cancelled, as if it had never taken place. Afterwards, as Rintaro and Daru go to a forum being held, Rintaro discovers the e-mail he sent Daru about Kurisu`s stabbing had arrived three days earlier, before coming across Kurisu, who is alive and well.\nSource: Wikipedia",

After getting some provisions from the androgynous Urushibara Ruka, Rintaro meets Amane Suzuha, who is hired by his landlord Yuugo \"Mr. Braun\" Tennouji as a part time assistant in his electronics shop. Later, Rintaro investigates the supposedly altered events and learns that a man calling himself John Titor, who claimed in 2000 that he was a time traveler, has surfaced once more in 2010. Believing this John Titor to be a fake, Rintaro is shocked to find that all evidence of Titor appearing in 2000 have disappeared. The next day, Rintaro encounters a strange woman named Moeka Kiryuu who asks for information on a retro PC model called the IBN 5100, which Rintaro gathers from Daru. Later, as Rintaro and Daru once again experiment with their Phonewave, a banana disappears from the oven and appears reattached to its bunch in gel form, at which point Kurisu arrives at the lab.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Discovering no one else was aware that the experiment even took place, Rintaro finds his D-Mail had indeed led to Ruka purchasing a lottery ticket, although his own personal error led him to get the number wrong. After a brief encounter with Suzuha, Rintaro deduces that the D-Mail had shifted him to a World Line Ruka had bought a lottery ticket and the D-Mail experiment never took place, explaining everyone`s altered memories. Confused as to why only he can remember the previous World Line, Rintaro contacts Titor, who tells him he may have the power to become a messiah and lead the world beyond the \"1% Divergence\" point and hence, change the dystopian future.\nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "As Faris learns about the PhoneWave upon overhearing a discussion between Rintaro and Daru, Rintaro discovers that the IBN has gone missing from the lab, which was apparently never found in the first place as a result of Moeka`s D-Mail. Kurisu deduces that the minor changes to the past that resulted from their previous D-Mails has caused a butterfly effect, leading to changes beyond their control. After learning that the IBN 5100 had been previously taken from Ruka`s shrine, Rintaro finds Moeka in town and confronts her, only to learn that she does not know the whereabouts of the IBN either. Rintaro also discovers that, unlike the previous World Line, everyone has met Moeka before in the current one, giving creedence to Kurisu`s theory. Rintaro and the others later visit Faris, whose true identity is revealed to be Akiha Rumiho, whose family owns Akihabara. Faris offers them information on the IBN 5100 in exchange for being allowed to send a D-Mail ten years into the past. Rintaro reluctantly agrees and allows her to send the D-Mail, causing him to experience another World Line shift. After learning from Faris`s father that they no longer have the IBN 5100 in their possession, Rintaro discovers that the physical geography of Akihabara has completely changed, no longer being a mecca for anime culture. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Kurisu then theorizes that it might be possible to send frontal lobe memories back in time through the PhoneWave, allowing the consciousness of a person to \"time leap\" into the past. As Rintaro goes into town with Mayuri to look for parts Kurisu needs, he explains to her that a time leap may be safer to conduct than simply sending D-Mails due to the nature of chaos theory, as the D-Mails can produce unexpected consequences once sent. They run into Moeka along the way, as well as Suzuha, who tells Rintaro that Kurisu allegedly works for SERN. As Kurisu denies this, she tells Rintaro about the problems she has with her father, who grew to hate her because she surpassed him in scientific prowess. Later on when out shopping, Okabe receives another threatening text message with a picture of a severed doll`s head attached, causing him to return to the lab, fearing for Mayuri`s safety. Later, Daru informs the group that the lab has been connected to the SERN network without them knowing. \nSource: Wikipedia",

As the repairs to the time machine are completed, Mayuri deduces from the time machine`s name that Suzuha`s father is actually Daru. After a short reunion, Suzuha travels back to 1975, though Rintaro notices the Divergence Meter`s reading has not changed. A few hours later, Yuugo delivers a letter written by Suzuha in the year 2000, revealing that she had committed suicide a year later. In the letter, Suzuha laments that she had failed her mission, as the damages to the time machine caused her to crash and lose her memories for 24 years.

As a car appears during Mayuri`s fated time to die, Rintaro attempts to change destiny by letting the car hit him instead, but Mayuri pushes him out of the way and dies in his place. After he leaps back in time, Kurisu has Rintaro reveal to her that she dies in the Beta world line. Later, Rintaro finds Mayuri visiting her grandmother`s grave, overhearing that she`s been having dreams of the times she has died, and that she has noticed Okabe`s suffering. Meanwhile, Kurisu visits the location where she is destined to die in the Beta World Line. \nSource: Wikipedia",

When Kurisu tells Rintaro that he should save Mayuri over her, he cannot accept it and runs back to the lab. As Rintaro attempts to time leap again, Kurisu stops him, worried that seeing Mayuri die over and over will destroy him. After giving in and choosing to save Mayuri, Rintaro tells Kurisu he loves her, to which she responds by kissing him. The next day, Kurisu prepares to return to America, while Rintaro and the others delete the original D-Mail from the SERN network. Just after erasing the data, Kurisu returns to the lab to tell him that she loves him, but is cut off as Rintaro shifts back to the Beta World Line. Some time after getting rid of the PhoneWave, Rintaro receives a call from an alternate Suzuha, telling him she needs his help to prevent World War III. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Suzuha explains that her mission is to prevent Kurisu`s death and enter a World Line known as Steins Gate, in which World War III never happens. Wanting to save Kurisu, Rintaro travels to the past with Suzuha in her time machine, arriving prior to Kurisu`s death. Witnessing events unfold as they did, Rintaro briefly runs into Kurisu, explaining their prior encounter, before hiding in the room where she will be stabbed. There, Kurisu meets with her father, revealed to be Doctor Nakabachi, who attempts to take ownership of her time travel theory for himself. Rintaro attempts to save Kurisu but inadvertently stabs her himself, allowing Nakabachi to escape with her theory to Russia, an event that will lead to a time machine arms race and eventually, World War III. As Rintaro falls into despair and refuses Suzuha`s offer of a second attempt, Mayuri slaps him, stating that that he was never one to give up on someone or something. Suzuha then reveals that Rintaro was intended to fail the first attempt so that the scrambled video message he received on the day of Kurisu`s death could be made viewable. This turns out to be a video from his future self, explaining that the key to saving Kurisu without changing the events that led him to develop the time machine and causing a paradox is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu has died. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Picking up a light up sword in order to use its liquid as a substitute for Kurisu`s blood, Rintaro and Suzuha return to the day of Kurisu`s death. In order to prevent a Metal Upa toy that would prevent Nakabichi`s paper from being destroyed by an on-board fire, Rintaro obtains it himself so that Mayuri ends up with a plastic one, which would later make its way to Kurisu and Nakabichi. Finding that the liquid in the gadget has dried up, Rintaro provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, leading him to run off in fear with Kurisu`s theory. After knocking Kurisu out with a taser, Rintaro uses his own blood from his stab wound and to recreate the scene he originally saw, fooling his past self and sending him on his time-hopping journey. As Rintaro returns to the present, Suzuha gives her thanks before she disappears, as she does not exist yet in the Steins Gate world line. After recovering his wounds, Rintaro starts giving out badges to the lab members he recruited in other World Lines, saving one for Suzuha, who will be born in seven years. Later, while walking in the streets of Akihabara, Rintaro has a chance encounter with Kurisu, who appears to have retained some memories of the other World Lines.\nSource: Wikipedia",

Due to Rintaro`s cancellation of Faris`s hotel reservations for them as a result of his ego, the group ends up checking into a motel. Later that night, Kurisu talks to Rintaro about the dreams she has had of past World Lines and the romance they shared. After visiting the card tournament Faris had entered, Rintaro spots someone that looks like Suzuha and chases after her, having a conversation in which she mentions that a fortune teller had foretold her having a child in seven years. After the girl leaves, Rintaro discovers that his phone is uncharged and he is almost broke, leading him to make his way back to the city on foot. He is eventually found by Kurisu, who becomes stranded with him after her car is found to be out of gas. While waiting to be rescued, the two discuss about the World Line where they confessed their love for each other, leading Rintaro to make his confession once again. \nSource: Wikipedia",
