Nao decides this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and starts to appeal to Shuusuke in every way she possibly can - including dressing up in a cute maid costume while Shuusuke is preparing dinner.\nBut it doesn`t all turn out for the best - Shuusuke ends up knocking over a bowl of mayonnaise and the two end up a complete mess. They rush to the bathroom to get cleaned up, where Nao asks Shuusuke to undo the zip on the back of her maid outfit... but Shuusuke is simply too nervous to do it...\nJust how will the rest of the night unfold for the two of them...?",
