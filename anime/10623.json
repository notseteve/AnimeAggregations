This is the story of what happened between those events. About a mysterious girl he briefly met when he first arrived at the train station who was later introduced to him as a moody trainee named http://anidb.net/ch67132 [Marie] by http://anidb.net/ch37509 [Igor] and http://anidb.net/ch37510 [Margaret] in the Velvet Room. He was asked to look after her as part of her training.\nNot only does she not like the idea of being looked after by this guy, she has no memories of anything from before she was introduced in the Velvet Room or of ever meeting him. Yuu and Marie try to figure each other out during that year between the horrifying events of murder and another world.",
