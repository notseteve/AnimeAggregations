Kasumi, unable to turn a blind eye to these insults against her family, is on the brink of engaging in a magic fight with Takuma...

Experiments on the dolls` operations are being conducted at the Steeplechase Cross-country venue, where security is abnormally tight - so much so that Tatsuya himself can`t even break into the premises. As such, Tatsuya orders Pixie to keep an eye out for the parasites while he conducts adjustments to the CADs and gives instructions to the underclassmen as an engineer. However, this continual sense of nervousness and nonstop days of hard work are tiring out Tatsuya. He`s never felt this tired before.\nSource: crunchyroll",
