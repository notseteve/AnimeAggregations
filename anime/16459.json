  "description" : "The black hole spaceship from outer space goes out of control in the universe and crashes everywhere, resulting in it brushing past the edge of the earth at high speed, causing the earth to spin up quickly, resulting in a rapid change of day and night, and the sheep and the grey wolf living each day quickly without knowing it. The sheep grow up fast, while the grey wolf and the red wolf grow old fast, and when they sneak into the sheep village to catch the sheep, they realise that they have turned into an old man, and the sheep defeat him easily. 　Lazy Goat stumbles upon a few dreams coming true and takes them as a revelation, doing everything as shown in the dreams. But the reality is not as good as his dreams, and he is safe and sound when he thought he was in danger. But when he thought he was safe, he fell into the claws of the wolf. Although he was rescued by Weslie, he still thought he was in a dream.\nsource: bgm.tv/deepl",
