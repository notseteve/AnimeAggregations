His roommates are no ordinary people: The lazy and wacky vampire Ira who spends most of his time gaming or watching TV, the unlucky dancer werewolf Vladimir, the serious and old-fashioned angel landlord Lynn and his naive little sister Lily, and many more.\nWhat none of them realize is that within Nini sleeps the power of the demon king. With evil forces in hot pursuit, can Nini and his friends head off disaster?\n(Source: QQ, translated)",
