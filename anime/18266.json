  "description" : "The Kingdom of Clays faces a dire crisis: an assassination attempt has just been made on its own Princess Lynneburg, and its neighboring countries eye the aftermath like starving vultures, plotting the Kingdom`s downfall. The ensuing conflict will shape the face of the continent for centuries to come...but Noor doesn`t have a clue about any of that! Having freshly arrived at the royal capital after over a decade of rigorous, isolated training at his mountain home, he`s dead set on achieving his childhood dream of becoming an adventurer, even if the only skills he possesses are useless ones. Sure, he can [Parry] thousands of swords in the span of a single breath, but everybody knows you need more than that if you want to be an adventurer! Our hero`s road to making his dream come true will be long(?) and arduous(?)—but if there`s one thing Noor`s not afraid of, it`s some good ol` fashioned hard work!\nSource: J-Novel Club",
