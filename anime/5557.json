  "description" : "* Based on a light novel series by http://anidb.net/cr8725 [Shibamura Jin], illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr6885 [Houden Eizou].\nA long time ago, a sacred fox was deified as the guardian of the Mizuchi family. http://anidb.net/ch4435 [Kuugen] the Fox was very wise and it could use various kinds of magic. However, because it was too mischievous, it was sealed into a small shrine in the hill behind the Mizuchi house by a priest.\nIn the present, http://anidb.net/ch4431 [Takagami Tooru], a Mizuchi descendant, often dreams of a woman who seems like a monster. The head of the Mizuchi household deduces that some sort of danger looms over Tooru, and she releases the sealed Kuugen in order to protect him. Contrary to what Tooru imagines based on the legends, \"Kuu-chan\", as Kuugen is affectionately referred to, is not a dignified creature. Not only can it turn into a woman of great beauty, but it can also assume the form of a man.\nSource: AnimeNfo\nNote: \"Oinari-sama\" is a respectful way to name a \"God of Harvest\".",

Kūgen shifts into his male form and asks Noboru to bring him to the town`s Shinto shrine, in accordance to the custom where a spirit has to ask permission from the local god before using his powers. They discover that the owner of the local convenience store is the local god, Ebisu, who serves as the patron of merchants. After accompanying Ebisu to the shrine, Ebisu orders his shrine`s gatekeepers—a pair of imperial guardian lions named Kōga and Eiga to attack Kūgen`s group. A battle then ensues which Kūgen wins after \"summoning Shin\" from the sky. Ebisu then explains that he was only trying to destroy his temple to attract more business. Ebisu also tells Kūgen in private that Miyako`s spirit still haunts the land.\nSource: crunchyroll",

The attacker uses a weapon that resembles blue wire. Mubyou, in a desperate effort to get away, throws out the brown wolf puppet which transforms into a guardian wolf, which the attacker shreds into small pieces. The next day, the Owl-Masked Figure meets Kou outside the house where she asks to meet with the Head of the Miduchi. During the meeting, the cloaked figure reveals that she is the god of a nearby land and that the Sakasaen is a treasure of her land which belongs to her, not Mubyou. Kuu agrees to help this god find Mubyou and help take back the Reverse Circle; they believe she fled to Suzunose. After an unsuccessful day of searching, Kuu and the Owl-Masked God battle one-on-one. Kuu gives Toru a green bracelet which resembles the one made from her hair. Noboru and Kou spend their evening at a park setting off fireworks; Kou blesses cursed men and receives alcohol in return. Mubyou tricks Toru into following her away from Kuu and puts the Reverse Circle around his neck. Kou is shown drunk at the end of this episode.\nSource: crunchyroll",

      "description" : "Kou accidentally breaks a window and is determined to pay for it herself, (as well as the for dishes she has been breaking). She turns to Misaki for advice, and Misaki suggests that getting a part-time job would be the best thing in order to pay for repairs to the window. Kou`s first job is at the tea shop, where Kuu tags along for fun. Kou is fired for breaking many of the dishes, and Kuu is fired for yelling at the customers and eating a lot of food during work. They get new jobs at Domo Burgers, where many girls line up just to order from Kuu in her male form. Kou gets fired for preparing food poorly, while Kuu is fired for flirting. They both get jobs at Ebisu`s market delivering pizzas. Kou gets lost and cannot find the delivery address; Kuu delivers pizza by throwing them on customers` doorsteps without obtaining payment - and those are all promptly stolen by a cat-demon who is a fan of Kuu. Kou and Kuu are fired once again.\nSource: crunchyroll",

The boys are reunited with their grandmother and uncle on this vacation. While everyone else decides to go to the town to shop for souvenirs, Toru chooses to stay by himself at the inn to play with a little girl. Unfortunately, the girl turns out to be a Zashiki-warashi who proceeds to drain Toru of his energy. Kou, realizing that nobody is protecting Toru, hurries back with the others only to find the inn in turmoil. Kuu captures the spirit, who then restores Toru.
