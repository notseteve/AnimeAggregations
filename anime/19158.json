  "description" : "When she doesn`t feel well, when there`s a test, when she doesn`t want to go to school... I take her place. I`m her replica. I`m not meant for anything else. But that changed when I fell in love. I wear my hair up so the boy I fell for knows it`s me. We skip school and promise to meet again tomorrow, and every day after. I`m her replica. Everything about me is borrowed and empty, but my heart is mine.\nSource: Yen Press",
