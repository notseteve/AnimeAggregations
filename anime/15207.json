However, Kaguya`s family has a strict policy prohibiting her from being photographed for any forms of publicity, and as result, she is unable to participate. As Kaguya longingly observes the rooftop photo shoot, the student council members propose to take a final group photo, solely for private use, on their cell phone, which makes Kaguya very happy. Just then a gust of wind blows across the rooftop, causing her to drop her phone and sending it way down below to the school grounds. Kaguya picks up her shattered cell phone from the floor and begins to reflect on all the photos with everyone she has lost, and becomes overwhelmed with sadness.\nSource: Funimation",
