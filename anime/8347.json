  "description" : "* Based on a manga by http://anidb.net/cr5353 [Azuma Mayumi] serialised in Comic Blade Masamune and later in Comic Blade Avarus starting on September 15, 2007. It is a spin-off of the mangaka`s earlier series http://anidb.net/a2183 [Erementar Gerad].\nThe Kingdom of the Sun, Fuajarl was ruthlessly invaded by the Garden of Eden. They came seeking the King`s Edel Raid, rumored to be one of the Seven Glittering Jewels (or Shichiko-hoji).\nSensing their intent, the King hid his daughter with his Edel Raid and fought against the invasion but was defeated in battle. The desert kingdom is now blanketed in a sheet of white snow after the battle.\nEscaping capture, the Crown Princess Acheaburca Fuajarl XIV reacted with Jeen, the King`s Edel Raid, and along with Puffe, the Kingdom`s only mechanic, fled Fuajarl in an ancient tank. They are on a journey to restore the Kingdom and exact vengeance on the Garden of Eden.\nHowever just like the first Erementar Gerad, it is uncertain why Edel Garden is a warring nation for a place that has the name of a beautiful Eden or Utopia.\nNote: This short animation clip was released as part of the special [i]Comic Blade Digital DVD sold at http://anidb.net/cr803 [Animate].[/i]",
