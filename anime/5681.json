With the help of his assistant, he is successful in reanimating a man recreated from parts gathered from corpses, but the creature is unpredictable and horrifying. The doctor flees back to his home in Switzerland, leaving his assistant in charge of destroying the monster. But Dr. Frankenstein soon finds that he cannot hide from his shameful secret forever, as mysterious murders are committed around him, forcing him to question if his creation really is dead and gone.",
