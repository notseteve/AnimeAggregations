  "description" : "Dooly is a baby dinosaur that was kidnapped by aliens, who experimented with him in order to learn more about Earth at the time, and they left him with superpowers. When he was returned to Earth, it entered the Ice Age. Separated from his family, he got trapped in ice, which caused him to spend the entire Ice Age frozen, but alive. About 10 million years later, the glacier that was keeping him sealed up broke off, and he drifted until ending up in Seoul.\nWhile in Seoul, he was found by a girl called Younghee and her elder brother Chulso, who mistook him for a dog and took him home, making him live with them as a pet. Their father Gildong, however, hates Dooly, and beats him up whenever he gets annoyed at him.\n— written by Cake-kun and Hinoe",
