  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr75733 [Hishikawa Sakaku] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr75734 [Daburyuu].\nLife hasn`t been kind to http://anidb.net/ch144386 [Zenos]. He was born in the slums, and his dirt-poor background has denied him almost every opportunity. After an encounter with a healer, he throws himself into studying to become one and finally catches a break when an adventurer invites Zenos into his party. Zenos is thrilled—so thrilled, in fact, that he`s willing to put up with his teammates treating him like garbage. They fail to appreciate his talents and ultimately kick him to the curb, claiming he`s outlived his usefulness to them. Now bereft of money and out of options, Zenos decides to put his self-taught skills to use elsewhere and opens an underground clinic. Word quickly spreads about the brilliant healer working incredible magic in the city`s shadowy underbelly. Even the royal palace is taking notice... Can Zenos buck the odds and carve out a life for himself in a world that`s spit in his face? And can he save the lives of the patients who wind up on his doorstep in the process?\nSource: J-Novel Club",
