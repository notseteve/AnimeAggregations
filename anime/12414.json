Standing in his path are heinous outlaws, delusional evil spirits, and a devout child of god. Even as it chips away at his life, Guts continues to fight his enemies, who wield repulsive and inhumane power, with nary but his body and sword - his strength as a human.\nSource: crunchyroll\nNote: The first two episodes received an early screening at a special event on April 2, 2017, at Tokyo Dome City Hall.
