  "description" : "Note: Development of this project was put on hold after the director and original creator, http://anidb.net/cr54 [Kon Satoshi], passed away in the 24th of August, 2010, right in the midst of production. On the 11th of November, 2010, http://anidb.net/cr731 [Madhouse] announced that production had resumed, with the character designer, http://anidb.net/cr11195 [Itazu Yoshimi], taking over as the acting director. At Otakon 2011, however, the movie`s producer, http://anidb.net/cr2380 [Maruyama Masao], revealed that production had been put on hold for financial reasons; at that point, he had also stated that he was dedicated to eventually be able to finish the film and that about 600 shots out of 1500 had been animated so far. On the 9th of August, 2013, Maruyama claimed at Otakon 2013 to be still striving to finish the project, despite the apparent inactivity.",
