  "description" : "* Based on an isekai adventure light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr73609 [Iris] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr53808 [Kannatsuki Noboru].\nFew titles are more revered among horndogs-(ahem) connoisseurs of Japanese erotic video games-than Magical Explorer. One day, our smut-loving hero wakes up to find he has been reincarnated into the body of the game`s dreamboat protagonist! Or rather, his hapless comic-relief best friend, Takioto Kousuke. But with his unparalleled knowledge of Magical Explorer and Kousuke`s unorthodox abilities (a scarf that doubles as a fist?), our hero vows to turn the game`s unluckiest loser into its mightiest heartthrob. In this world, nothing is out of reach when you`ve got the know-how!\nSource: Yen Press",
