  "description" : "* Based on a harem rom-com manga by http://anidb.net/cr56789 [Igarashi Masakuni].\nAt the end of a difficult day, the haughty but purehearted rich kid Arisu found his only solace in the voice of another girl his age, who hosted a livestream under the pseudonym \"Apollo.\" Then, one day, the broadcasts stopped. Arisu has dedicated the years since then to finding Apollo`s true identity, and he`s narrowed it down to one particular high school. He transfers in as a student and figures it`ll be a cinch—but then discovers it could be any of the girls in the broadcasting club! And the real Apollo isn`t talking for reasons of her own! These four girls have no use for Arisu`s personality, but they each harbor dreams of using their voices to build a career, and they sure could use his money... Can the blunt and blustering Arisu buy his way into the club`s good graces, and find the real girl attached to his dream voice?\nSource: Kodansha",
