  "description" : "The year is 2099. With the development of medical artificial human body technology \"Somadia,\" humans are able to overcome all injuries and illnesses. However, with the development of Somadia, crimes that misuse this technology are also on the rise. Somadia have physical abilities that far exceed those of a living body, and by illegally modifying them, they can be misused for crimes. In order to deal with such Somadia crimes, the government has created the bounty hunter system. Civilians who are registered as bounty hunters are allowed to kill Somadia criminals designated by the police and can receive large amounts of money in return. In this world, Ubu Shinsui makes a living as a bounty hunter, hunting down criminals. But one day, when she returns home from work, she finds her sworn enemy, Mr. Elegance, there - and her fate begins to go awry.\nSource: ANN",
