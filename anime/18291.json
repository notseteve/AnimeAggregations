  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch136400 [Nina] had a rough start to life, orphaned and stealing to survive, only to be abducted for her unusual lapis lazuli eyes. But to her surprise, her captor, http://anidb.net/ch136398 [Prince Azure], ordained that she would live the life of a princess...specifically, that of the recently deceased princess-priestess, Alisha, who had her same eyes. Despite her changing fortune, Nina won`t give up her old life without a fight. Azure might just be the one to finally match her wits, but how much can she trust him? And can she stop the feelings budding in her heart, knowing she must eventually marry another...?\nSource: Kodansha\nNote: The first three episodes received an early screening at a special event on 29 September 2024 at United Cinemas Toyosu in Tokyo.
