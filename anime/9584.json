One morning, Nagi inadvertently awakens early at the Sanzenin Mansion and discovers how the early mornings can be so delighted. She follows a scent of cooking and found Hayate in the kitchen. After eating breakfast, Nagi tries not to get sleepy by doing some exercise which isn’t easy for someone of her lifestyle. At Wataru Tachibana`s video store, Nagi purposely rents an R-18 naked porn DVD mixed with a stack of random ones; however, when she presenting it to Shiranui in her tree house Nagi found out she had grabbed an R-18 horror DVD by mistake. Ending up watching the whole film Nagi becomes terrified and screams \"HAYATE!\" and begs him to stay by her side all day until she`d fallen asleep, and Hayate whispers her a good dream that suppress her fears. Maria also watches the film and its déjà vu. Shifting back at the Violet Mansion, Nagi confined herself from going to school on a soggy day. Hayate tries to persuade Nagi by using advice to motivate her. Maria lends Nagi some money saying that each yen represents life, and it is given by someone and you will never get anymore, so she should not waste it. This finally inspires Nagi to go to school together with Hayate admitting that morning days are interesting.\nSource: Wiki",

Nagi, Hayate, and Maria are watching a recap of Ruka`s concert on TV at the Violet Mansion. Ruka got the day off so she makes a surprise visit there and informs them her amazing opportunity. Tactlessly, she doesn`t know how to `ride` a bike so she intensely desires Hayate to teach her how since he`s a professional at bicycling. Ruka first practices in the yard but ruins Maria`s garden. It soon gets dark, Chiharu suggest Ruka should try practicing on Hakuō Academy`s grounds. Hayate strictly trains Ruka to ride a bike down a steep hill, that looks risky. He pushes her down the hill and catches her before she falls, hoping it would help overcome her fear of falling. At the end of the day, Ruka and Hayate start having fun using a squirt gun. Nagi asks Hayate if he can teach her how to ride a bike too but expects him to do it more kindly. Later, Hayate, Hinagiku, and the Hakuou Three Amiga, were invited to see Ruka`s next concert. Hayate receives an urgent call from Ruka and Atsumari depending him to act as a backup dancer in a maid outfit on the stage, also Ruka wishes for his service because she`s in a stress. The concert begins with Ruka singing through willpower. Before her last song, Gilbert shows up and battles Hayate. The staff members mistakenly put Gilbert’s robot on the stage and goes on rampage.

Following at Café Donguri, Hayate gives Ayumu some Nikuman he made, at that moment, she realizes her constant consuming of Hayate`s food is the reason she`s gaining weight.

Hayate was baking cookies for her, Maria asks him whether he remembers Izumi`s, Risa`s, Miki`s, Isumi`s, and Yukiji`s birthday, but he answers all the questions correctly. Nagi and Chiharu decide that they should throw a surprise party for Ayumu over at Café Donguri. Before they can start setting it up, Ayumu arrives!

Ayumu finally leaves after part-time and everyone quickly prepares the party. Nagi calls for Ayumu`s return, but she is too dismayed, so Nagi use a sympathetic manner to convince her. Ayumu comes back and they surprise her with the party. Feeling overjoyed, she jumps onto Nagi. Back in the present, Ayumu walks home with Hayate saying it`s unsafe during the night, leaving Hokuto confused. They go to Shiomi high school, to pick up Ayumu`s notebook that she forgot. Hayate thought if his parents hadn`t sold him to the yakuza he probably would`ve accepted Ayumu`s confession from before (Season 1 episode 12). As they leave, after defeating a monstrous thief, Ayumu decides she will do her best to lose weight.\nSource: Wiki",

      "description" : "Top of the Hakuou clock tower, Chiharu is doing a speech pattern when Aika catches her unguarded. Aika responds that side of her is cute. Chiharu believes there are others who are more unguarded than herself, like Hinagiku, as she hangs out with Nagi due to their common interest. Later, Chiharu decides to have a barbecue for the tenants, and she has Hayate give her grocery shopping assistance. She asks Hayate what would he do if a girl confesses to him; he gives a serious answer. Ruka arrives at the Violent Mansion as she accepted Chiharu’s invitation. Ruka asks Ayumu if Hayate would become her boyfriend even if it means kissing him, which irritates Ayumu. As Hayate and Chiharu return, Ruka also asks Hayate what would he do if a girl confesses to him. He responds to Ruka and Ayumu that Chiharu asked him the same question, but they misunderstood it to be Chiharu confessing to Hayate. Then everyone celebrates at the barbecue. Kayura is eating the kebabs and making weird remarks. In a flashback, Hayate and Nagi remember when they first met Kayura (and pitching up a tent). After Kayura rented a room at the apartment, she enrolls as a transfer student at Hakuō Academy, so Hayate and Nagi gladly give her a tour around the campus until they reach the clock tower and Hayate casually shows them Hinagiku changing. Back in the present, after the barbecue and the tenants go back to their rooms, Kayura states that you should not take your instant feelings too seriously. Hayate accidentally sees Hinagiku changing again; prompting everybody to say that Hayate is the one who is most unguarded.\nSource: Wiki",

In the morning, for some reason Nagi won`t wake up, and the sudden concern of a \"kiss by Hayate\" in a dream begins to creep the girls out once said they all had the same dream. During lunch, the girls discuss it would have to be someone who loves Hayate who kisses him, but Aika seriously doubts that would happen. Kayura objects that anyone would like a troublesome guy like Hayate (after showing them footage of Kyonosuke`s affection for Yukiji). Worried if the dream is true and Hayate has to break this curse, he goes off to find someone whom he could kiss. He bumps into Ayumu at the exact spot where they first met believing this is his chance, but Fumi and Sharna interrupt. Hayate tried asking Athena, Ruka, and Chiharu, but naturally they all can`t do something so impulsive. Hinagiku thinks about the ominous presence that Isumi sensed earlier from Hayate, and the tanuki explained if Hayate doesn`t kiss someone by the stroke of midnight he and Nagi will be separated forever.\nSource: Wiki",

He tried to kiss Athena, but Linn and Armageddon got in the way. Ruka met up with the others and mention that she ran into Hayate earlier during an interview and also tried to kiss him except that Kayura forbids it. As Hayate tried to contact Chiharu, Sakuya and Isumi are found in Shimoda to pick up the still active Black Camellia. After more unfortunate events, in Underdog Park, Hayate finds Yukiji and reluctantly challenges her for a kiss, however before he could kiss her, Kyonosuke arrives and carries Yukiji away. Five minutes before midnight, Hayate is in a predicament now that all the other girls have found him. After Nagi talks with the tanuki inside the dream, Maria, Sakuya, and Isumi bring over the dozy Nagi to Hayate. Nagi explains it doesn`t matter if Hayate kisses someone or not, because she will always have him as her butler. Then, suddenly Hayate kisses her on the forehead!? Hayate corrects everyone that he meant a kiss on the forehead not on the lips, leaving the girls confused and relieved. The broken Black Camellia shows Shin and Yukariko watching them.\nSource: Wiki",
