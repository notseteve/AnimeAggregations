  "description" : "* Based on a shounen manga written by http://anidb.net/cr8335 [Shimizu Eiichi] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr8334 [Shimoguchi Tomohiro], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr32008 [Champion RED].\nThe life of the 14-year-old http://anidb.net/ch1280 [Hayase Kouichi] has always been a mediocre one, if not dismal. However, those days of being bullied by classmates and escaping into a fantasy of being a hero are put to an end when an accident bestows on him a girl and a gigantic humanoid robot called Linebarrel. The extraordinary power that Kouichi obtains puts him and everything around him on a sudden roller-coaster ride of battles, intrigues and friendship! During the course of his adventure, Kouichi starts to learn what life has to offer; he meets new friends, bids farewell to the old ones, but most of all he now has considerable responsibilities and is forced to confront the world around him.\nSource: www.linebarrels.jp/english",
