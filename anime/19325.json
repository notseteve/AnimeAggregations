  "description" : "Takiguchi Yoi has long legs, a deep voice, and a handsome face...in other words, Yoi is such a good-looking guy that most people don`t notice or care that she is, in fact, a girl. Indeed, she`s had the nickname \"Prince\" for as long as she can remember. That is, until she met Ichimura-senpai...the only person who really seemed to see her for herself. To her surprise, she`s not sure how to handle this new relationship, especially when her newfound friend is a prince himself (and a guy prince, at that). The story of the two high school princes starts here!\nSource: Kodansha",
