She pleases everyone around her to the extent of ignoring herself due to her lack of confidence. She has nightmares daily and a unique hair colour that cause some friction at home and suspicion at school.\nOn a day like any other at school, a strange man named http://anidb.net/ch4946 [Keiki] appears before her. He kneels and swears allegiance to her, promising to protect her and never leave her side. Thereafter they are pursued and attacked by demon-like beasts. In this mix enters two of her classmates who unfortunately happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. To escape the onslaught, Keiki transports them to his world. Unfortunately during the journey they are ambushed and end up separated from one another.\nNow they have to learn how to survive in a new land, one with magic, swords, demon-like beasts and immortals.\nThis anime is based on text novels written by http://anidb.net/cr1214 [Ono Fuyumi]. It features a complex fantasy world with a rich mythology behind it. The series tells us not only Nakajima Youko`s story, but also stories about other people who came to live in this world.",

Because she can’t speak the language, she travels with Shusei, the traveling performers.  One day she meets an Immortal named Riyo who can understand her language.  Rin begs her to take her.  Riyo takes her to the mountain and gives her an Immortal Status so she can understand the language, but practically slaves her for 100 years.

      "description" : "Since Yoko grew up in Horai, she can not believe in the Heaven’s Will, yet, she is afraid of repeating the mistake Shoko made for the same suspicion.  En-o tells Yoko a story about a man he calls another him.  En-o and Atsuyu both had a cowardly father.  Atsuyu got rid of his father for the people and En-o let the people die for his father.  Atsuyu demands a new emperor status above the king for the people, and En-o faces him to see who deserves the king.  En-o survives and Atsuyu lies in his grave.  En-o’s story does not give Yoko answers but a plenty of inspiration.\nSource: crunchyroll",
