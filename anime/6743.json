  "description" : "The original version was a record talkie (silent film with synchronized sound on disc). A 16mm version and a 9.5mm Pathé Baby version were simultaneously released by Chiyogami Graph, a label of Chiyogami Eigasha (the record number reveals that this film was recorded only on side A). However, sounds are missing from the existing version. The Spring Song is a lovely piece of music known as the theme song for the Spring Dance Performance presented by Shochiku Kageki Division at the Osaka Shochikuza theater. Even today, the song is sung by OSK Nippon Revue Company, the successor to the Shochiku Opera Division, under the title Cherry Blossom Country. The Spring Song recorded in the Japan Art Animation Movie Collection (1) DVD: Works by Noburo Ofuji (organized by the Japan Association of Audiovisual Producers; published by Kinokuniya Shoten, 2004) is a version synchronized with record music.\nSource: Animation Film Archive",
