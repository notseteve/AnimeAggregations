  "description" : "The story is set in a town where animals and vehicles live together. They cooperate to protect the townspeople from various troubles that emerge.\nA follow-up to the 2023 TV anime, this season features episodes which are around 8-minutes long, as opposed to the 2-minute episode TV series.\nWhile following a similar format the the TV anime, it introduced a new Vehicle Zoo pair, as well as a recurring antagonistic character. The series also featured the full version of the theme song, used as an ending animation rather than an intro, and being composed entirely of recycled footage from the episode rather than the previous accompanying animation.\nsource: tomica.fandom.com",
