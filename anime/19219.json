  "description" : "In an alternate 21st century, rich mafia members can turn into \"Demon Kings\" through increasingly popular ether-enhancement surgery, and the bounty hunters called \"Braves\" are the ones called upon to take them down. Yashiro only wants the simple pleasures in life - pizza, beer, and card games. When three young Braves offer him a majestic sum to be their private tutor, he agrees solely for the money - but is it worth what he`s getting himself into?\nSource: Manga Planet",
