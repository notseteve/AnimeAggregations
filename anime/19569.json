Reborn into a fantasy world, he settles into a previously unknown job class called \"rearguard,\" capable of providing his (all-female) party with critical attack, defense, and recovery support. And it comes with an added bonus: Simply being at the back of the party line increases his companions` fondness for him! Freed from the shackles of corporate life, Arihito is eager to start fresh as a newly minted Seeker!\nSource: Yen Press",
