Gai reveals to Shu that he sent Inori to protect him because a student at his school who is secretly a drug dealer nicknamed Sugar saw him during the Undertakers battle with the GHQ at Roppongi and confirms Shu`s suspicions that Gai can see other people`s Voids. Because Gai only recognize Sugar`s Void as pair of large shears, Shu has to confront his fellow classmates one by one and take out their Voids to confirm their identities. After several failures and escaping the wrath of class representative Kanon Kusama, Shu soon figures out Sugar is actually his friend Yahiro Samugawa, after figuring out Yahiro knows a lot of things he shouldn`t know and his taste of horror films. His identity exposed, Yahiro angrily shows his true self before Shu subdues him by pulling out his Void. Inori tries to kill Yahiro but Shu stops her as Yahiro is still his friend where both he and Yahiro resolve their difference and not reveal each other secrets. But the next day, Yahiro betrays Shu by selling him out to the GHQ led by Major Makoto Waltz Segai.\n<i>Source: theTVDB.com</i>",

Upon learning Gai and the Undertakers will attack the Facility to rescue their \"comrade\", Major Segai brings Shu to the Isolation ward, revealing Yahiro sold him out so his brother, a victim of the Apocalypse Virus, can get treatment. Furthermore, Major Segai justifies GHQ`s harsher actions for the safety of Japan and uses Shu`s feelings for Inori and his doubts about Gai. He reveals that the \"comrade\" Gai wants to rescue is mass murderer Kenji Kido, which makes Shu question Gai`s trustworthiness. The Major gives Shu a transmitter disguised as a pen that he is to use if he comes in contact with Gai. Later that night, a disguised Gai visits Shu and tells him his plans to rescue Kenji, however, Shu doesn`t want to be involved. Tsugumi informs the two that Inori has disobeyed Gai`s orders to stand by in order to rescue Shu. Shu, worried, goes to save her, forcing Gai to change his plan. Protected by Ayase`s Endlave Steiner, Shu heads to where Inori is at until he encounters Kenji himself and uses his Void, a Gravity gun to stop the GHQ Endlaves and rescue Inori. After Isolation Facility`s destruction, Gai offers Shu to follow him. Shu reluctantly agrees, however, he keeps the transmitter given to him and does not inform Gai of his exchange with the Major.\nSource: theTVDB.com",

Gai assigns Ayase as Shu`s instructor while he leads a mission to take over \"Leukocyte\". Ayase dislikes Shu but is only training him because it was Gai`s orders and Shu has to pass the trial as Ayase has his pen, unaware it`s a transmitter but she will only give it back after passing the trial. After some hard training, Shu encounters Inori, telling her that he joined the Undertakers because of her and asks her if she will join him if he wanted to leave the Undertakers. But Inori tells him she won`t because Gai gave her a life and purpose and claims Gai told her to use his feelings for her to join Undertakers before entering Gai`s room. Dejected, Shu runs away and bumps into Ayase, who consoles Shu and gives him some encouragement for tomorrow`s trial. Unknown to both of them, despite what it seems, Inori is actually giving Gai a blood transfusion. On the day of trial, Shu has a mock battle with Ayase`s Steiner where if he gets past Steiner and into the vehicle behind it, he will pass the trial. Shu succeeds the task after using Arugo`s Void to blind Steiner and get into the vehicle where Ayase and the Undertakers congratulate Shu of the becoming one of them. Just as Kenji arrives, the Undertakers receives a troubling report from Tsugumi. Gai earlier led a team to intercept the arrival of mercenaries and Endlaves at an airport but their position was shoot by Leukocyte, an orbital satellite laser.\nSource: theTVDB.com",

      "description" : "Gai survives the attack but reveals that his team and the mercenaries were killed by the Leukocyte blast. At the outskirts of Tsukigase Dam, Gai briefs the Undertakers that their mission is to attack the Dam where the Leukocyte control system is located but due to the Leukocyte`s security system, he will have Shu use Kenji`s Void to disable it. Shu doesn`t want to take part of the operation as he`s afraid of the people who will die if he fails until Inori goes to talk to him. Meanwhile at Tsukigase Dam, Major Segai informs the Anti Bodies director Shuichiro Keido that his men are prepared for the Undertakers attack including Daryl, who wants revenge against the Undertakers for stealing his Steiner. As Gai gets another blood transfusion in a room alone, he confesses to what he assumes is Inori that he regrets of the lives who died for him and it was difficult to act as their fearless leader until he realizes the other person was in fact Shu due to Inori. Shu admits he never wanted to see this side of Gai and agrees to join the operation. As the Undertakers distract the GHQ forces guarding the dam, Shu, Gai, and Kenji sneak into the Leukocyte control system with Inori defending them. As Gai and Shu hacks the control system with Tsugumi`s help via Funell, Segai sends Daryl to stop them which Gai battles and disables Daryl`s Endlave. However, Daryl damages the control system, sending one of the Leukocyte`s crashing to the dam. In order to stop it, Gai makes a deal with Segai that he will stop the crashing satellite using Shu`s transmitter, revealing it is actually a targeting beacon for the Leukocytes, in exchange that he destroys all records of Shu`s involvement with the Undertakers. Realizing Gai is sacrificing himself to destroy the falling satellite, Shu, with Inori`s encouragement, combines Kenji`s and Inori`s Voids to destroy not only the falling satellite but also the one still in space. With the operation over, Shu finally accepts Gai and the Undertakers while Shuichiro speaks with a mysterious blond youngster over \"Cocytus awakening\".\nSource: theTVDB.com",

      "description" : "Shu returns to school with Inori since his arrest by the GHQ. Thanks to a cover story that he was interviewed by the GHQ for finding one of their cellphones and the student council president Arisa Kuhouin supporting Shu and defending him against malicious rumors, his classmates welcome him back with open arms. Shu also learns from his friends Hare Menjou and Souta Tamadate that Yahiro hasn`t been back to school since his arrest. Later, Shu`s mother Haruka comes back home and welcomes Inori living with them with open arms. Meanwhile, the Undertakers are running out of supplies and need a new supply route which Gai knows someone who will help them. The next night, Arisa and her grandfather, the head of the Kuhouin Group attend a party on a cruise ship where Shu and Gai have snucked in to make a deal with Arisa`s grandfather. However, the Anti Bodies learn about the deal from an \"informant\" and sends Daryl, Segai and Rowan to work with GHQ Colonel Dan Eagleman whom the latter plans to shoot down the ship with Surface to Air missiles. After Gai flirts with Arisa and makes his business proposal with her grandfather, Shu learns from Tsugumi about the attack and tells Gai about it in order to save the passengers on the ship which include his mother. With Gai`s help of bringing Arisa to the upper deck, Shu is able to extract her Void and use it to shield the ship from the missile which Colonel Eagleman orders his men to fire all of their missiles which are stopped thanks to Shu. With the threat over, Arisa`s grandfather agrees to help supply the Undertakers which unaware to everyone but Gai and Shinbugi, Gai was the GHQ informant. Before leaving, Gai comments to Arisa despite the tough image she gives out, she is very shy when being doted on by others. As Shu and Inori leaves for school the next day, Shu admits to her that this is the first he was glad to use Voids while Haruka looks at a photo with her, her son Shu and the girl from Shu`s memories. \nSource: theTVDB.com",

In truth, the retreat is actually a mission for the Undertakers to get Souta there so they can use his Void to enter a secret GHQ facility located at a shrine and steal a special item. As Shu and his friends have fun on the beach, Gai and the rest of the Undertakers monitor them. As Shu pays respects to his father, Kurosu Ouma, an expert on the Apocalypse Virus who he died during the \"Lost Christmas\" incident ten years ago, Gai suggest to Shu to use Souta`s crush on Inori to get him alone so they can get his Void much to Shu`s dislike. That night, Souta is alone with Inori and is about to confess to her but is stopped by Shu who immediately pulls out his Void and much to Shu`s embarrassment, the Undertakers were watching him with Ayase and Tsugumi wondering what he was about to say about his relationship with Inori. As Gai, Inori and Shu enter the facility using Souta`s Void, a camera that takes pictures of doors and opens them, they find too late to discovered the item, a canister containing the origin of the Apocalypse Virus, has been taken by Shuichiro earlier and cancel the mission. The next morning, Shu and Souta makes amends on their relationship and their hardship of understanding each other. As everyone leaves Oshima, Inori explains to Shu how people`s Voids change based on his relationship with them. \nSource: theTVDB.com",

As Hare is about to confess to Shu on the train, Yahiro suddenly appears which Shu tell Hare to go shopping herself as he wants to talk with Yahiro. Yahiro brings Shu to his hideout where his brother, Jun is also staying and reveals that he and his brother have been on the run from the GHQ because they wanted to euthanize Jun. While Shu won`t forgive Yahiro for betraying him, he will help Jun escape for Yahiro`s sake and calls the Undertakers to pick them up. However, the GHQ have been following them and sends Seiga and Daryl. Cornered in a warehouse, Shu forcibly takes Yahiro`s Void before telling Yahiro he will never betray his friends just like him. Daryl`s Endlave arrives and fight Shu using a new weapon that targets his Void while Seiga watches. But when Jun stands up, the weapon target him instead. Suddenly, the crystals on Jun`s body migrate to Daryl`s Endlave and takes control of it and proceeds to attack the GHQ and Yahiro. Shu stabs the infected Endlave with Yahiro`s Void and enters Jun memories where Jun himself shows Shu his and Yahiro`s past before the \"Lost Christmas\" incident. Jun also reveals because of the crystals on his body, he could see people`s true self including his brother, who while loves and cares about him, also hates him for burdening him as well. Wishing for his final memories of loving Yahiro and not hating him, Jun begs Shu to use Yahiro`s Void to end his life before he kills Yahiro which Shu is forced to do so which Jun thanks him. With Jun`s death, the infected Endlave breaks down while Seiga leaves. As Yahiro regains conscious and asks where Jun is, a mortified Shu confess to Yahiro that he killed him, unaware that both of them were followed by Hare. \nSource: theTVDB.com",

With the GHQ higherups gone, Shuichiro took over control of the entire military, and declares that the Funeral Parlor spreaded the disease as an act of terrorism. Meanwhile, after an call from Tsugumi, Shu finally regained control over himself. He then gathers Hare, Souta, Yahiro, Kanon, and Arisa, and explained to them that he wanted to go and rescue Gai and Inori. After witnessing Shu`s power to draw out voids, the five students agreed to tag along. Back at the GHQ Headquarters, Haruka managed to escape from Shuichiro, but bumped into Inori and Gai. With Haruka`s help, Inori was able to sing and broadcast her song \"Departure\" all over Japan. The song was able to reverse the effects of the Apocalypse Virus. At the same time, Shu and his friends arrives at the GHQ HQ, breaking through the barricades using different voids. When Shu finally reached Inori, a blond-haired boy appeared from behind and withdrew Inori`s void, then sliced down on Shu. But Gai appeared and took the hit, saving Shu. The episode ends with Shu holding the unconscious Gai, while Shuichiro and Segai enters the Gate of Hell leading to Cocytus. \nSource: theTVDB.com",
