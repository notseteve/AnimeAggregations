  "description" : "The story is set in Obake Town, a town where everything can change into something else. http://anidb.net/ch30040 [Anpanman] and the others receive an invitation to the town`s Bakeru Carnival, where those skilled at transforming can use their skills to entertain people. However, a resident of the town named http://anidb.net/ch122392 [Dororin] is unskilled at transforming, and is unable to enjoy the Carnival from the bottom of his heart. He has a chance meeting with Cream Panda and strikes up a friendship. Together, they venture into a forest in search of the Black Cape, said to hold the world`s greatest powers of transformation. But Baikinman is also after the cloak for its power that will allow him to rule Obake Town. Now it is up to Anpanman, Cream Panda, and Dororin to protect the town.\nSource: ANN",
