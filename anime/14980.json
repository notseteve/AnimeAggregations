  "description" : "In 22XX, with a sudden decrease in the human population, various allied species coming from other planets are invited to populate the Earth. As a result, new mixed races with special abilities began to be born, causing ecosystems to be machined at an accelerating rate where the plants and animals are being excluded.\nAmong them, a special tribe who can manipulates plants has been exterminated, but only one of them survives and try to accomplish the mission to cover the earth with forests. The protagonist named Yuki, born from his father, member of the Hero tribe, and his mother with the ability to manipulate plants, gains the skills of both tribes, and he asks himself who should he help and who should he fight.\nSource: AnimeAnime.global",
