  "description" : "Van, the fourth son of a powerful noble, is only two years old when he remembers his past life as a salaryman in Japan. With his adult brain in a young body, he`s considered a child prodigy...until he displays the \"Production Magic\" skill when he turns eight. In a family that favors offensive magic, this crafting skill is considered useless in battle, and Van is banished to oversee a tiny country town in disgrace. With only his personal maid, his father`s butler, a knight, a rescued slave, the memories of his past life, and his \"worthless\" magic, can Van improve the fortunes of this little village—and himself?\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
