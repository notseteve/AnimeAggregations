  "description" : "Sailor Stars is divided into two arcs. The first arc is relatively short with six episodes that re-introduce the previous season`s villain, http://anidb.net/ch8524 [Queen Nehellenia], as well as the four http://anidb.net/ch7495 [Outer Senshi], who meet her for the first time. http://anidb.net/ch7524 [Sailor Pluto]`s arrival together with http://anidb.net/ch7522 [Sailor Saturn] meant that a new and more powerful enemy is approaching the Solar System who has distorted the timeline already as Sailor Pluto explained to the inner senshi group. These episodes originated as filler to allow Takeuchi time to begin her new story-arc; afterward the season follows the manga. The second arc is relatively long, and is the basis of the Sailor Stars theme which focusses mainly on this new unknown enemy`s eventual arrival on Earth. Its plot branches out to introduce new characters and even new Sailor Senshi from other planets, including the http://anidb.net/ch7568 [Sailor Starlights], Princess Kakyuu, and http://anidb.net/ch8660 [Chibi Chibi]. As in the manga, http://anidb.net/ch7463 [Chibiusa] returns to her own time after the final battle with Nehellenia, but is not a participant in the climatic events of this story arc. The sailor senshi discover that the other sailors - the Sailor Starlights, are actually running away from another threat and they are very dedicated to finding their princess of their own Solar System, which was taken over by this main threat. The sailor starlights believe that their princess is actually The Light of Hope who can save them from running away and fight back against this new enemy - hence their search for their princess takes them to search through the people on planet Earth, the last realm untouched by the enemy. The main threat turns out to be http://anidb.net/ch8650 [Sailor Galaxia], queen of an organization called http://anidb.net/ch8649 [Shadow Galactica] and a powerful former sailor senshi - the most powerful sailor senshi of the whole galaxy. Sailor Galaxia is forced to rule the galaxy by her own evil within herself. By collecting true star seeds (the equivalent of the manga`s Sailor Crystals) from Sailor Senshi throughout the galaxy, her powers increases. However, Sailor Galaxia knows within herself the fate which awaits her upon meeting the receiver of the Light Of Hope, the light ray which she sent before she became corrupted by http://anidb.net/ch8688 [Chaos], and so secretly seeks her to rid of her evil within herself.\nSource: Wikipedia",
