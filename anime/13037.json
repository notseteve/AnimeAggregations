  "description" : "* Based on the light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr3065 [Matsu Tomohiro] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr2985 [Yabuki Kentarou].\nFresh in his first year of high school, Shiranui Makoto came to Tokyo to seek an apprenticeship under his parent`s acquaintance, world famous Illusionist Mamoru Hoshisato. Ever since watching a performance by Mamoru Hoshisato and his wife, Makoto had always wanted to be a Illusionist. The couple`s daughter Kana (nicknamed Hatena), incidentally, was also his childhood friend. Though Tokyo is a constant source of many strange and chilling incidents, still, since Hatena would be by his side, Shiranui Makoto isn`t too concerned.\nInside the Hoshisato residence known as a haunted house, Makoto receives a warm welcome from the butler Jeeves and the maid Emma, and meets Hatena once again. However, as much as Hatena welcomes Makoto`s arrival, she and he don`t really get along, and in the end...!?\nSource: Animesuki",
