  "description" : "Misaki is suddenly having some unexpected and odd problems. What started as a need for some college entrance exam tutoring has somehow led him to being romanced by a suave older man who also happens to be his big brother`s best friend. Confused by all of his brand new emotions, Misaki struggles to deal with his suddenly very odd life. And if that wasn`t enough, his suitor, Usami, has plenty of issues of his own. A man-child who decorates his room in giant teddy bears and toys, Usami is a famous novelist who also writes steamy boys` love novels on the side. When Misaki cracks open one of these books and reads sentences like \"Misaki licks every inch of Usami`s hot body\"...well, let`s just say that all hell breaks loose.\nSource: mangaupdates.com",
