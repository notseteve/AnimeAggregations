However, another new trial awaits him! The start of the second semester brings with it the impending class performance at the Ayanagi Festival. This will be the first stage performance the boys will have to tackle without the help of a senior leader to guide them. Yuuta and the others throw themselves eagerly into overcoming their team boundaries, joining forces to form a new company to put on the best show ever. But the Kao Council suddenly makes an appearance and stands in the way of the second years! As a part of their plan to reform the Ayanagi Festival the Kao Council is producing a fresh new program called the opening ceremony. The students selected for this performance will go on to be the prime candidates for next Kao Council, but it will come at the expense of not being able to perform in the class production. And thus, the final curtain rises on the tale of the youthful, comedic musical.\nSource: crunchyroll",
