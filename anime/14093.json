  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy adventure light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr55063 [Mine] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr55065 [Kabocha].\nWhen death tapped Kunugi Renya on the shoulder, he smiled and went willingly. After enjoying a nice, long life of 94 years, he was looking forward to shutting his eyes for the last time. He was, therefore, understandably upset when he woke up again in an empty space, devoid of memories, with a young girl in a tunic rambling on and on about how she`s God. So, he did what any reasonable person would have done under those circumstances: he sent the girl flying with a kick to the face. It turned out that the girl was indeed God, and she was in a pinch. She urgently needed someone to do some interdimensional Resource smuggling, and Renya fit the bill. His mission: cross the boundary into another world, then chill for a few decades. God would handle the rest. To sweeten the deal, she offered him an eighteen-year-old body and a whole laundry list of ludicrously powerful skills, yet he remained hesitant. Then, she mentioned the food - an exotic world comes with exotic delicacies - and this sealed the deal. The next thing he knew, he was standing in a foreign land, younger, stronger, and more clueless than ever. Will he survive this world? And more importantly, will the world survive him?\nSource: J-Novel Club\nNote: The anime was supposed to air in October 2018 but because of original creator`s controversial actions it was cancelled. This entry will be deleted from the database in the near future.",
