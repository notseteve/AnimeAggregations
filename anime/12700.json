Sengoku`s not the neighborhood watch, though. He`s a professional ballroom dancer. And once Fujita Tatara gets pulled into the world of the ballroom, his life will never be the same.\nSource: Kodansha Comics\nNote: The first episode received an advance screening at the Anime Expo 2017 convention on July 2 in Los Angeles.
