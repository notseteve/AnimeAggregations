  "description" : "The theatrical version of the 52 episode TV series. It was produced in 1982 with more or less the same staff that was involved with the TV series. However, halfway through the production, chief director http://anidb.net/cr4122 [Toriumi Hisayuki] got tired and http://anidb.net/cr131 [Oshii Mamoru] (who together with http://anidb.net/cr5759 [Annou Masami] had directed and storyboarded majority of the TV series episodes) ended up doing most of the directional work on the movie.\nNo theatrical release was actually made and it became available to the general public as an OVA in 1985.",
