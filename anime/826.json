  "description" : "Saint Seiya is a story from Masami Kurumada about warriors called `Saints` whose task is to protect, and to fight against evil forces. There are also evil Saints in the story who are on the hostile side. It is said that every 200 years an evil will come back to earth and try to rule the world, and at the same time, the Goddess Athena will be reincarnated to prevent the evil from accesion to power on earth. The story has five main chacters: Seiya the Pegasus Saint, Shiryu the Dragon Saint, Shun the Andromeda Saint, Hyoga the Cygnus Saint, and Ikki the Phoenix Saint. The task of these Saints is to protect Athena, the Goddess of peace, and to defeat the evil forces. The Saints wear special armour, which each has deserved after years of hard training. Their armour not only protects them from external impacts, but also gives them special abilities. The armour represents a star constellation, from which a Saint also gains his power, called cosmo. The cosmo of a Saint is like an aura. According to the story, everyone has a cosmo, which he/she is able to discover.\nSource: AnimeNfo",

Believing that it is his destiny is to die at the hands of these friends, Shun submits and accepts his fate. Slipping in and out of consciousness, Shun has a vision of his brother Ikki (Phoenix). In the vision, Ikki convinces Shun that he controls his own destiny based on the choices he makes in life, and he has a choice of whether or not to accept his own death. Shun snaps out of unconsciousness and defeats his attackers, then joins his friends to leave for Greece.

The disguised man then surprises them by ripping offhis cloak and mask and informing them that he is Tremy of Sagitta. Tremy threatens that he won`t even let them through the first house, and fires golden arrows at them. Seiya defeats him easily but not before Tremy wounds Saori with an arrow through the heart.

The keeper of the first house is Moo, their friend from Jamir, and the gold saint of Aries. Moo informs them that before they continue with their attack on ArIes, they should allow him to repair their weak bronze armour. Although it will eat-up an hour of their precious time to save Saori, they agree. Mob also gives them some sage advice about their fightIng powers: he tells them they must discover their seventh-sense-the one beyond the sixth sense of intuition. And if they don`t have the seventh sense in their souls, they will never defeat the gold saints that stand between them and pope ArIes. Once the artnour is repaired, the bronze saints race off to the second house, leaving Saori in the care of Moo and Kiki. In the second house, they encounter Aldebaran, the gold saint of Taurus. The awesome power and confidence of Aldebaran leaves the bronze saints shaking in their bronze boots, but Seiya quickly overcomes his fears when he realises that he must defeat this monster to save Saori.

He allows the bronze saint to proceed to the third house; the house of Gemini, but when the other bronze saints try to go with him, Alderbaran stops them. His logic is that only Seiya has beaten him, so only Seiya should be allowed to advance. So, the others are forced to fight the stubborn Alderbaran themselves, and together they manage to impress the gold saint and he allows them to run on ahead to join their friend. Moo and Alderbaran have a heart to heart about the bronze saints, and Alderbaran reveals his fondness for them and wishes them well on their quest.  When the bronze four try to enter the house of Gemini, they are unable to find a way in. They decide to split up to save time. Cygnus and Shun are successful and find a way in.

When he arrived back to his own dimension, Cygnus found himself in the house of Libra. There, he met Crystal`s (Cygnus`s mentor) mentor the gold saint of Aquarius. Aquarius informs Cygnus that he has been ordered not to let Cygnus through this house, and he attacks Cygnus as he tries to pass. Unwilling to fight Aquarius, his acting mentor, Cygnus tries instead to convince him of ArIes`s evil ways, hoping this will persuade him into letting him pass. It doesn`t work. Instead, Aquarius has his own agenda: to help Cygnus discover his seventh-sense. But Cygnus is unwilling to let go of the memory of his mother and is subsequently held back and unable to achieve his seventh-sense power. So, wanting Cygnus to die painlessly, instead of at the hands of an evil gold saint, Aquarius attacks Cygnus with a powerful blow and enshrines him in a large block of ice. Is Cygnus dead?

So, Aioria is now an evil gold saint fighting for ArIes. Upon hearing this, Shina tries to rush to Seiya`s side, but she is too weak and collapses. As Aioria stands over a broken Seiya and prepares to deliver the final blow, that will end his fighting days, we …\nSource: crunchyroll",

Angered and frustrated, Shaka tries to destroy Phoenix`s brain as well, but he is too late. Phoenix has been down so low that he cannot go any deeper. He has searched his soul and found his inner seventh-sense power. Due to his inner goodness and pure heart, Phoenix becomes more powerful than Shaka could ever dream of becoming and he begins to overpower Shaka. But Phoenix knows that the only way he can truly destroy Shaka is by sacrificing his own life to take Shaka`s. So he does just that. Phoenix grabs hold of a stunned Shaka and burns up all of his powerful energy in an intense heat. By building up a massive burst of energy Phoenix explodes and takes Shaka with him, into a million bits.

Shiryu`s mentor, the gold saint of Libra, sends his gold armour to them. The gold armour of Libra is a special one in that it can change into 12 different weapons. The trick, however, is knowing which one to choose for the desired result you want. After testing each set of weapons, Shiryu chooses the sword; it is the correct choice. He wields it well and frees his cold friend. Shun volunteers to tend to his teeth-chattering friend while Shiryu and Seiya run on ahead to the next house to save Saori.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Milo takes pity on Cygnus and, out of respect for the gold saints Camus, agrees to let Cygnus live if he leaves the sancturary immediately. Cygnus refuges, claiming that he would rather die than disappoint his friend and Athena. Milo respects his with his wish and tries to destroy him, but with his back up against the wall and his senses leaving his body, Cygnus draws from the powerful energies of his friends and the goddess Athena to realise his seventh sense after all. He manages to deliver a powerful “ Aurora Thunder Attack” and freezes Milo’s gold armour rendering it useless. Milo recognaises that Cygnus has achieved his seventh sense and believes that maybe Saori is the real Athena after all. He tries to heal Cygnus’s wounds and wishes him well in the next house, but there is now only four hours left to save Saori.\nSource: crunchyroll",

Tatsumi sent Saint Geki the bear to bring Athena’s sceptre to her side, and as it is placed in her hand, something magical happens. The gold saints’ armour of Sagittarius arrives in the sanctuary, reuniting all of the gold armour for the first time in thirteen years. All of the remaining gold saints come together as their armour begins to ring out like old friends greeting one another. Pope Arles is pleased that he has all of the gold saints’ armour in the Sanctuary, but he is worried that something might still go wrong, especially since the bronze saints have made it through the ninth house and are only two away from him. As qickly as the Sagittarius armour appeared, it just as quickly flew through the sky int the house of Sagittarius. Inside, Seiya and Shiryu are waiting.. Once they near the gold armour, it begins to move on its own. It points its Sagittarius arrow at Seiya and without warning fires at him.\nSource: crunchyroll",

After a confused Seiya ponders the significance of it all, he realises that where arrow has penetrated the wall leads to a secret passageway. Shun comes to, and Cygnus arrives, reuniting the four bronze saints together for the first time in a while. They all decide to enter the passageway to see where it leads. Once inside, the entrance disappears behind them and the ceiling begins to press down upon them like a vice. Shiryu yels for the others to run ahead to the tunnel while he tries to hold up the ceiling ; they reluctantly agree, although worry about their friend’s welfare. Up ahead, the three saints must evade a barrage of rocks flying at them, and then deal with a torrent that prevents them from moving onto the next passageway. Cygnus volunteers to take care of it, to allow Seiya and Shun advance. Next, the two saints come to a wide opening in the rock and they must use Shun’s chain to swing across, but the chain gives out and the two falls to the rocks below. But, then, the power of the sagittarius armour energises the four saints giving them extreme powers and the strength to emerge unscathed from their predicaments and unite again in the house of Sagittarius’s main chamber.

Seiya, Hyoga and Shun end up on the side away from the house (close to the eleventh house), but Shiryu is stuck on the side near the exit of the house of Capricorn.

      "description" : "In Asgard, a land filled with snow in Northern Europe, a woman known as Polaris Hilda, representative of the Norse God Odin, prays to preserve the peace in her land. Suddenly, a mysterious force speaks to her, urging her to destroy the Sanctuary. Hilda refuses, so she is swept away by the force. When she recovers, a strange ring is on her finger, and she calls upon the God Robes of the Asgard God Warriors. Seven warriors are granted these sacred Robes: Siegfried is granted the Dubhe God Robe Robe of the Alpha star, Hägen is granted the Merak God Robe of the Beta star, Thor is granted the Phecda God Robe of the Gamma star, Alberich is granted the Megrez God Robe of the Delta star, Fenrir is granted the Alioth God Robe of the Epsilon star, Syd is granted the Mizar God Robe of the Zeta star, and Mime is granted the Benetnasch God Robe of the Eta star. All seven God Warriors gather ready to serve Hilda. Syd is sent to the Sanctuary and defeats Taurus Aldebaran with one blow. Syd then arrives in Japan, and his target is Saori. He defeats Jabu, Nachi, Ban, Geki and Ichi easily. As Syd is about to attack Saori, Shun arrives with his new Andromeda Cloth and restrains Syd. Seiya arrives with his new Pegasus Cloth immediately afterwards, dealing a kick which takes Syd by surprise and sends him crashing to the ground. When Syd retaliates with his Viking Tiger Claw, Seiya and Shun realize that he is just as strong as the Gold Saints. Saori is confused because Hilda is a peaceful person and Syd reveals that Hilda will take over the Sanctuary. Shun is next to fight, but is distracted and defeated. Ikki comes to his rescue, with his new Phoenix Cloth. Seiya comes back to redeem himself and is able to strike Syd with his Meteor of Pegasus. However, he was injured by Syd`s Viking Tiger Claw. Saori stops Seiya from fighting, just as Shiryu and Hyoga arrive with their new Dragon and Cygnus Cloths. Syd, acknowledging the fact that he must defeat the five Bronze Saints in order to kill Athena, retreats for now. Saori and her Saints plan their strategy and head to Asgard.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Asgard soldiers trap Hyoga and try to convince Freya to come back to her sister, but she refuses, hoping that Athena will save her sister. Hyoga defeats the soldiers. Then, Saori appears before Hyoga and Freya. Seiya, Shun and Kiki arrive, and Freya explains that Hilda is not acting like herself. The worst part is, the world is now in danger. Hilda was praying to stop the Polar ice caps from melting, but since Hilda stopped praying, the ice caps are melting and will flood the Earth. Hilda and her God Warriors suddenly appear before them. Saori notices the ring on Hilda`s finger. The ring is known as the Nibelung Ring, which turns its wearer evil. The Bronze Saints set out to reach the Valhalla Palace and remove the ring from Hilda`s finger in order to bring Hilda back to normal. Saori decides to stop the Polar ice caps from melting, but with her power, she can only contain the caps for 12 hours, before the sun sets. Hilda and her God Warriors leave, while Phecda Gamma Thor volunteers to stop the Saints.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Seiya decides to distract Thor, allowing Shun and Hyoga to move forward. Seiya stops Thor`s Mjolnir Hammer technique with his Meteor of Pegasus, but Thor simply changed their direction towards Shun and Hyoga, knocking them out cold. Seiya, now alone, manages to evade Thor`s Mjolnir Hammer, but before he is able to counterattack, Thor`s Titanic Hercules technique takes him out. Seiya is able to get up again and attacks with his Meteor of Pegasus, but Thor is able to block them and attacks again. As he lays in the snow, Seiya tries to figure out how to defeat Thor. Marin reminds him of the battle of the 12 Houses and how he was able to overcome the difficulties to save Athena. She says he has matured and has nothing left to teach him. Seiya remembers what he learned when he fought Taurus Aldebaran and Leo Aiolia, and how desperate he was to save Saori back then. He gets up, ready to fight once more. As Thor attacks again, Seiya tries to see the light speed attack and manages to stop it. He then sends Thor flying and crashing to the ground. Seiya then strikes with the Meteor of Pegasus and buries Thor in the snow. However, Thor gets up again, showing off a stronger Cosmo full of hatred. He explains how difficult life has been for the people of Asgard, and hopes that Hilda will lead the people to take control of the Sanctuary and the world. Seiya tries to explain that Hilda is possessed, but Thor ignores him and strikes with his Titanic Hercules, empowered by his strengthened Cosmo.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

However, he is rescued by Shiryu, who has come from the Five Ancient Peaks of Lushan and brought information from Roshi. The master reveals that to remove the Nibelung Ring, one must have the legendary sword Balmung. To retrieve the sword, the seven Odin Sapphires, the seven God Warriors` guardian stones, must be gathered after defeating them. Shiryu goes to wake up Hyoga and Shun while Seiya distracts Thor, but Seiya is knocked down again. Saori`s Cosmos burns brightly and Seiya gets up to fight Thor. As the three Saints continue, Thor stands in their way, but Seiya comes back and executes a powerful Meteor of Pegasus which sends the giant crashing into a wall of ice. Saori`s Cosmos reminds Thor of when he first met Hilda. Thor used to hunt in the forests near the Valhalla Palace and gave the hunted prey to the poor people of Asgard. As he was hunted by the soldiers, Hilda arrived, apologized to Thor, since he was able to do something she couldn`t, and his wound was healed by Hilda`s gentle Cosmos. Since Hilda`s personality has completely changed, Thor has doubts about her intentions, but he ignores it and continues to fight. After Seiya is able to block Thor`s attack, both use their techniques again and clash, with Seiya earning the victory. Thor asks Seiya to restore Hilda to the way she was before, and falls to the ground, dead. Seiya picks up the first Odin Sapphire. The four Bronze Saints decide to split up to defeat the other God Warriors and reach the Valhalla Palace.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Hägen received his God Robe in that place and has trained there since childhood, mastering both ice and fire techniques. As Hyoga tried to see through Hägen`s technique, he is continuously overpowered and knocked down, but still manage to stand up and asks for the Odin Sapphire. Both attack each other again, but Hyoga falls unconscious. Just as Hägen is about to throw Hyoga into the lava, Freya arrives and tries to tell him about Hilda and the Nibelung Ring. However, Hägen still believes Freya is being manipulated. Hägen is about to attack, but Freya stands in his way, refusing to move. He reluctantly launches his technique, but Hyoga saves her in time. Hägen and Hyoga attack once again with Great Ardent Pressure and Aurora Execution, but Hyoga awakens the Seventh Sense and overpowers Hägen, killing him. Kiki arrives as Freya mourns Hägen`s death, and Hyoga mentions that this is a sorrowful battle they are forced to fight.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Hilda, angered that three of her God Warriors have died, is confident she can still win since most of the Bronze Saints are injured. After Seiya falls off a cliff, he remembers how the Gold Saints Aiolia, Milo, Aldebaran, Shaka and Mu gave up a portion of their blood in order to revive their five Bronze Cloths, which explains their new appearances. The Gold Saints made this sacrifice as a sign of gratitude to the Bronze Saints for rescuing Athena. Seiya climbs back up the cliff and reminds himself to not give up. Meanwhile, Shun remembers the victims at the Battle of the 12 Houses, wondering how long the needless sacrifices will continue. He then encounters the fourth God Warrior, Benetnasch Mime. Shun attacks with his Nebula Chain, but he cannot sense any threat from Mime, which leaves his chain useless to attack with. However, despite not showing any threat, Mime easily breaks through Shun`s defenses with an attack at the speed of light. Shun is then questioned by Mime, asking him why he fights, and makes him realize peace will never come, no matter how many opponents he defeats. Suddenly, Ikki speaks to Shun and tells him to believe in their future and never give up. Renewed with vigor, Shun prepares to fight back against Mime.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Ikki tells Mime that he used to hate his destiny and it was because of his friendship with Seiya and the Saints that he found a reason for fighting. Even though Mime gains the upper hand, Ikki cannot sense any hatred within him either. Mime reveals his childhood past. He was trained by his father Folker, a mighty warrior of Asgard, respected by all, who forced him to train. One day, Mime found a locket with a picture of him as a baby and his real parents. Folker reveals that he killed them. When Asgard was at war with a neighboring country, he killed Mime`s father and mother, and took Mime to raise him as his own. As Mime mourns his family, Folker mocks him, causing Mime to kill him in one blow. Since then, he has deposited his hatred in his techniques. Ikki uses his Phoenix Illusion, allowing Mime to see his true memories, hidden long ago. When Folker died, he begged forgiveness for what happened. Folker actually let Mime`s father go, but he foolishly struck back. Folker counterattacked, but he accidentally killed both him and his mother. After making a grave for them, Folker raised Mime and cared for him. Even though Mime hated him for what happened, he still loved Folker as his father. Now filled with rage, Mime`s hatred is brought to the surface, ready to destroy Ikki.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Shun struggles to defeat Syd in order to rescue his friends, but his chains are ineffective. Syd unleashes his ultimate technique, Blue Impulse, against Shun, tossing him in the air and crashing to the ground. Meanwhile, Shaina is on her way to the Valhalla Palace. As Shun is out cold, Ikki speaks to him, urging him not to abandon his friends or Athena and reminding him of when he unleashed his true power in the Battle of the 12 Houses. Shun also remembers the Gold Saints` sacrifice and removes his Cloth and chains to unleash the Nebula Stream. The stream opens up a hole in the roof, letting all the cold air out. Syd attacks with his Blue Impulse, but Shun awakens his Seventh Sense and counters with the Nebula Storm, killing Syd. However, while Shun attacked, someone tried to attack him, and Shaina took the blow instead. Shun retrieves the Odin Sapphire and Shaina tells him to go. The mysterious man emerges from the shadows, stopping Shun. The man who attacked Shun is revealed to be the God Warrior, Alcor Bud, Syd`s shadow. He also revealed that he was the one who defeated Taurus Aldebaran and attacked him from behind. Bud demands Syd and Mime`s Odin Sapphires, so Shaina stands up to face him. Siegfried is surprised about Syd`s shadow, but Hilda knew this whole time. Shaina is no match for Bud and is quickly defeated. Bud unleashes his Shadow Viking Tiger Claw and almost defeats both Shun and Shaina, but Ikki arrives in time to save them.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Bud, angered at the fraternal bond between Shun and Ikki, begins to attack, saying that compassion is useless. Ikki miraculously blocks Bud`s lightspeed attack before they clash, whereupon Bud`s helmet is knocked off, and his face is exactly like Syd`s. Bud reveals that Syd is his younger twin brother. Ikki confronts him about not helping his brother, and Bud responds that if Syd dies, he will become the true God Warrior of Zeta, and no longer be a shadow. Ikki attacks, but Bud easily avoids his technique, because he was observing his battle with Mime. Ikki goes down and Bud keeps attacking him, while Shun struggles to help his brother. While fighting, Bud reveals that on the day he and Syd were born, his parents had to pick one to keep, because in Asgard, twins were hated. It was believed that twins would destroy a family. Syd and Bud`s father reluctantly abandoned the infant Bud in a forest, where a villager found him and raised him, while Syd was lucky enough to stay with his family. Years later, while hunting, Bud encountered his brother Syd without realizing it, until he noticed that they both had the same family daggers. As Syd left with his family, Bud put it all together and realized who Syd was. Enraged, Bud decided he would be superior to Syd. Later on, he was chosen as a God Warrior, but was still Syd`s shadow. Hilda tells Bud that he must stay hidden, but if Syd dies, Bud would become the God Warrior of Zeta. Ikki, feeling sorry for Bud, gets up, and for his brother`s sake, swears to win the battle.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

In his mind, Bud defeats Syd, but for some reason, he can`t give him the death blow. Ikki confronts Bud about trying to help out Syd during his battle with Shun, even though he claimed he wanted Syd dead. Ikki and Bud clash again, with Ikki coming out on top after awakening his Seventh Sense. Suddenly, Syd sneaks up on Ikki and holds him so that Bud can defeat him. Even though Bud is concerned, Syd tells him he`s dying anyway so he doesn`t need to worry. Ikki asks Syd if he knew about his brother all along. Syd confirms this by saying that him and their parents never stopped caring about him. Syd was also willing for his brother to be a God Warrior. Ikki tells Bud that he will not stop Bud`s attack, but something holds him back. Syd dies at that very moment, and Bud realizes what was holding him back, was the love he had for his brother. Ikki explains that even though brothers can sometimes hate or kill one other, they never forget when they cared about each other. Bud leaves, with Syd in his arms, believing in the world Ikki fights for, a world where brothers who are separated, can reunite and live happily. Earlier, Hyoga used all of his power to make a path for Seiya to continue. Seiya gets up and Hyoga tells him to keep going. Shun and Ikki move forward, to fight the last God Warrior.

No matter what technique Shiryu uses, Siegfried is unscathed, making him wonder if he`s really immortal, just like the legend. Back at the caps, Saori can`t hold on anymore. Shiryu is struck by the Odin Sword technique and thinks about using the Final Dragon, like he did on Shura. He holds on to Siegfried and prepares the forbidden technique. Just then, Shura`s spirit talks to Shiryu and tells him not to do it, otherwise not only will he not protect Athena, the Odin Sapphire would be destroyed as well. Siegfried gets loose and uses the Dragon Bravest Blizzard on Shiryu. He then remembers Roshi`s lesson on a double-edge technique, and its weak point, which can not only hurt the opponent, but hurt the one who uses it. Shiryu tells Seiya to watch carefully and he burns his Cosmo to strike Siegfried at his weak point, his heart, just like Shiryu`s weak point when Seiya first fought him. Siegfried from the legend also had the same weak point. After killing the dragon, Siegfried became immortal after bathing in its blood. However, a leaf fell on his back, just behind his heart. Later that day, he was hit on that spot by a spear, thrown by someone jealous of him. He died due to his weak point. Shiryu accomplished what he needed to do in order to show Seiya Siegfried`s weak point, and faints. Seiya gets up for his friends to fight once more. Hilda waits by her throne, and is visited by someone working for the being who gave her the Nibelung Ring. Seiya has to strike Siegfried`s heart at a 100,000th of a second in order to win.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Hilda suddenly arrives and attempts to finish off Seiya, but Siegfried stops her to confirm his doubts. They attack again, with Seiya`s Meteors pushing back Siegfried`s Dragon Bravest Blizzard and attacking his heart. Seiya has finally won and goes to retrieve the Sapphire. But a man, playing a flute arrives and introduces himself as a Mariner General serving the God of the Sea Poseidon, Siren Sorrento. He has come from the Sanctuary of the Sea, under Poseidon`s orders to take Hilda with him. Sorrento reveals that Poseidon took control of Hilda with the Nibelung Ring, in order to control the world ruled by Athena and kill her. Seiya tries to stop Sorrento, but his music is affecting his mind, leaving him vulnerable for an attack. Siegfried, now realizing the truth and Seiya being right, he hands over the final Odin Sapphire to him. He then goes to fight Sorrento, using the last of his strength. Sorrento plays his flute, with his Dead End Symphony, which is similar to the Siren of Greek Mythology that lures sailors with its music to devour them. Siegfried covers his ears and destroys his eardrums to stop hearing the music, but its useless since it goes directly to the brain. Even though Siegfried is attacked, he still goes to fight Sorrento and holds onto him. Using his last bit of strength, Siegfried takes Sorrento, rising to the sky, sacrificing himself to kill the General. He entrusts Asgard and Hilda to Seiya, who swears his death will not be in vain.

Julian Solo`s family is one of the wealthiest sea merchants in the world and he is the heir. When he met Saori, he proposed marriage to her, but she respectfully declined. Julian was chosen as Poseidon`s reincarnation and vessel. Poseidon tells her that the rain will continue for 30 days, and the water will remain for 150 days, killing all of humanity, but spared Saori, since he is still in love with her. He offer Saori the chance to rule beside him, but once again she rejects him. Saori is willing to sacrifice herself, and hopes her Saints will arrive to crush Poseidon`s ambition. Back in Asgard, Hilda and Freya discover ancient texts that reveal a path to Poseidon`s Sanctuary. The path is a giant whirlpool, and Seiya and Shun are sucked in. They arrive at the underwater Sanctuary, and there`s no water since the water is held up above them. Suddenly, Mermaid Thetis, a Mariner working for Poseidon appears. Seiya and Shun chase after her, trying to see if she knows where Saori is. Thetis tries to trap them using her Coral Trap to encase them in coral, but Seiya destroys it.

      "description" : "Seiya and Shun recover and defeat the Mariners who have arrived. Meanwhile, Poseidon takes Saori to a place where she will give humanity a chance to live, by sacrificing her life. He explains that the underwater Sanctuary has Mammoth Pillars that hold up the seven seas: the North Pacific, South Pacific, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Antarctic Oceans. The Mammoth Pillar holding up the sea in its entirety is the Main breadwinner. If it is destroyed, the underwater Sanctuary will be no more. The water that is raining down on the Earth, now falls upon Saori while locked inside the Main Breadwinner, flooding the room inside, drowning her, giving humanity a chance. Also, the seven Mammoth Pillars are being protected by the Mariner Generals, Poseidon`s high ranking warriors said to be as powerful as the Gold Saints. Sea Dragon leaves and Thetis tells Seiya and Shun about Saori and the Mammoth Pillars. Saori will die when the room inside the Main Breadwinner is filled with water. The only way to destroy the Main Breadwinner is to destroy the other seven Mammoth Pillars and defeating the seven Mariner Generals. With their mission clear, Seiya and Shun head for the Pacific Oceans. At Lushan, Kiki takes Shiryu back to Asgard to reach Poseidon`s Sanctuary. Even though Shunrei is sad about Shiryu leaving, Roshi explains that it is his and the Saints` destiny to save the world. After defeating more Mariners, Seiya reaches the North Pacific Mammoth Pillar. He launches a Comet of Pegasus to destroy the Pillar, but it`s blocked by the Mariner General, Seahorse Baian. Hyoga returns to Asgard and dives into the whirlpool towards Poseidon`s Sanctuary. Seiya`s Meteor of Pegasus is blocked by an invisible wall created by Baian. He is then sent flying by Baian`s God Breath.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Baian uses his most powerful attack, Rising Billows, which sends Seiya all the way to the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Shiryu and Kiki arrive in Asgard and dive into the whirlpool. Seiya was able to return to the battlefield, determined to win. As he attacks with his Meteors again, Seiya is able to break through Baian`s defensive wall. Shun arrives at the South Pacific Mammoth Pillar and sees a mysterious woman, but she transforms into a demon. It attacks, but Shun is able to defend himself with the Roling Defense. Being taunted by the guardian of the Pillar, Shun is confronted by the Mariner General, Scylla Io. Back at the North Pacific Pillar, Seiya`s Pegasus Cloth started to shine like a Gold Cloth for a moment. Seiya explains that it was the Gold Saints` blood, which revived the Bronze Cloth, that turned it gold. Grateful for what the Gold Saints gave him, Seiya attacks again. Meanwhile, Thetis stands in Shiryu`s way, but Kiki distracts her with his telekinesis while Shiryu leaves, unfortunately he is no match for the mermaid. Baian is confused as to why Seiya`s attacks reached him, but Seiya explains that he was able to attack him because Lizard Misty, the first Silver Saint he ever fought, used a similar defensive wall and saw through it. Baian`s Seahorse Scales were cracked due to Seiya`s Meteors. Baian attacks again, but his techniques are now useless against him. Seiya burns his Cosmo to the Seventh Sense and his Pegasus Cloth turns gold again. With a mighty Comet of Pegasus, Seiya finally kills Baian. Shiryu and Hyoga arrive and Seiya explains the situation to them. They then head off to different pillars while Seiya stays behind to destroy the North Pacific Mammoth Pillar.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Meanwhile, Kiki is saved by Ophiucius Shaina who brought the Libra Gold Cloth with her, under Roshi`s orders. Seiya plans on destroying the pillar using his own body, but Kiki stops him and brings the Gold Cloth to him. Meanwhile, Shaina stayed behind to fight Thetis. The Golden Shield flies to Seiya`s hands, and he uses it to finally destroy the North Pacific Mammoth Pillar with a mighty throw. As the pillar is destroyed, the Sanctuary shakes and it appears as though the sea is coming down. The Saints and Thetis sense the pillar is destroyed as well. Hyoga and Shiryu split up to go to different pillars. Seiya tells Kiki to find Shun and give him the Libra Cloth. Meanwhile, back at the South Pacific Ocean, Shun remembers the legend of Scylla, which turns into six horrible beasts (eagle, wolf, queen bee, serpent, bat and bear) and when a ship sailed near its lair, six sailors would meet their doom. Io starts his assault with his first attack, Eagle Clutch and breaks Shun`s defense. Then, he uses Wolf`s Fang, Queen Bee`s Stinger, and Serpent Strangler, which severely injure Shun. Next is Vampire Inhale, making Shun lose a lot of blood. Finally, Io unleashes the strongest attack, Grizzly Slap. However, he didn`t attack full force in order for Shun to choose the attack that will kill him. As Io uses Queen`s Bee Stinger, Shun counters with his chain turning into a Spider Net, allowing him to destroy the queen bee.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

When hope seems lost, Capricorn Shura`s spirit talks to Shiryu and reveals something when he saved his life. Shura gave power to Shiryu`s right arm, allowing him to use the legendary sword, Excalibur. Shiryu gets up and faces Krishna again. Both weapons clash, but the shield stops the lance. Shiryu`s shield and Dragon Cloth turn gold and Shiryu tries to use Excalibur, but it doesn`t work. Krishna believes Shiryu depends too much on his Cloth, so he removes it, risking his life to awaken Excalibur. Finally, Shiryu corners Krishna and cuts the Golden Lance with Excalibur, along with the Chrysaor Scales. Shiryu asks Krishna to stand down, but he suddenly levitates in the air, unleashing a more powerful Cosmo.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Hyoga arrives at the pillar and senses a familiar cold air. A Mariner General greets him, and he is revealed to be Issac, Hyoga`s training partner when he trained with the Crystal Saint. Now the Mariner General Kraken Issac, he attacks Hyoga, leaving him confused because Issac used to fight for justice and wonders why he has changed. As children, Issac and Hyoga were close friends and grew strong together as the years went by under the Crystal Saint`s training. Issac`s dream was to become a powerful Saint and fight for justice to protect the Earth. He thought Hyoga`s goal was the same. In the present, Hyoga noticed Issac`s left eye is nothing but a scar now. Hyoga, sorry for Issac`s pain, allows him to destroy one of his eyes as payment. Issac, however, only hurt his eyelid. He then reminds Hyoga of the Kraken legend. The Kraken used to devour ships in one fell swoop, but only attacked people with evil intentions. Issac wanted to have the Kraken`s cruelty to defeat evil and fight for peace. One day, Issac found out the real reason why Hyoga wanted to be a Saint, to be able to see his mother in the sunken ship. Angered and disappointed, Issac attacks Hyoga, but at the same time, shows him how to break the ice caps. He also warned Hyoga that if he swims to the bottom, a strong current would trap him, and he would never be seen again. Hyoga finally broke the ice cap, and swims, but is caught in the current. Issac swims down to rescue his friend, who is unconscious. Suddenly, the current traps both of them. Issac`s eye was wounded by a stalactite and tries to break a hole in the ice cap to save Hyoga. He succeeds in saving Hyoga, but Issac is dragged across the ocean, leading him to Poseidon`s Sanctuary. Issac found out overtime that Hyoga became the Cygnus Bronze Saint, fought against the Sanctuary and killed his masters, Crystal Saint and Aquarius Camus. That`s when Issac decided to become a Mariner General. He then attacks his former friend with his Aurora Borealis.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Hyoga gets up and tries to tell Issac he`s wrong, but Issac insults his former masters, that they weren`t strong enough to protect the world. He then attacks Hyoga again, knocking him out. Just then, Kiki arrives, and Issac attacks him to take the Libra Cloth and stop the pillars` destruction. Kiki refuses to let the box go while Issac stomps him mercilessly. Kiki is risking himself, just like his friends are, so he can be a Saint one day. Hyoga gets up and lets Kiki rest until Issac is defeated. Hyoga burns his Cosmos to the Seventh Sense and attacks Issac with Diamond Dust. As Issac recovers, he sees Crystal Saint`s and Camus` images behind Hyoga, giving him power. Issac attacks again, but Hyoga blocks it, with the Cygnus Cloth turning gold. He tries to convince Issac again to stop what he`s doing. In Athena`s Sanctuary, Mu and Aiolia sense what is happening. Aiolia wants to help the Bronze Saints, but Mu stops him because of Roshi`s orders to remain in the Sanctuary. Issac prepares one more Aurora Borealis, but Hyoga counters with the Aurora Execution, defeating Issac. He is proud that Hyoga finally set aside his feelings. Hyoga uses the Golden Libra Tonfa to destroy the Arctic Ocean Mammoth Pillar. Before dying, Issac warns Hyoga about the man who started this horrible battle. Meanwhile, Ikki continues toward Poseidon`s Temple. However, Sea Dragon suddenly stands in his way.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Ikki demands Sea Dragon to reveal who he is. He removes his helmet, and he reveals himself to be Gemini Saga`s twin brother, Gemini Kanon, who is pure evil. Kanon sends Ikki to another dimension, using his Golden Triangle, which resembles the Bermuda Triangle. He then claims he will rule both the Earth and the sea. Seiya recovers, sensing Saori`s weakened Cosmos. Shaina is still fighting Thetis and is able to defeat her with her Thunder Claw. As she leaves, Thetis warns her about fighting Poseidon, who is now a god. Shaina arrives at the Temple, remembering Juilan Solo is a rich merchant and never had any training. But he exposes a powerful Cosmo, just as strong as Athena`s. Shaina attacks, but Poseidon immobilizes and defeats her. Seiya senses Shaina`s Cosmos and heads to the Temple. Shiryu recovers and heads for the Temple as well. Kanon claims the Generals dying are according to his plan, but he encounters Sorrento, who has survived the battle against Siegfried in Asgard. As they talk, Sorrento doubts if Poseidon really started this battle and demands to know Kanon`s identity and if he revived Poseidon. They then sense a powerful Cosmos and return to their pillars. Shun arrives at the South Atlantic Mammoth Pillar and is shocked to see Sorrento. Back in his battle with Siegfried, Sorrento got loose and escaped his grasp, meaning Siegfried`s sacrifice was in vain. Shun is attacked by Sorrento`s Dead End Symphony, but is saved when they hear Athena singing from the Main Breadwinner.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Poseidon then destroys the Pegasus Cloth and is about to finish off Seiya, but Shiryu arrives in time to protect him. At the Sanctuary, Milo, Shaka, and Aldebaran gather around Mu and Aiolia, with Milo wanting to help the Bronze Saints. Shiryu attacks Poseidon, but to no avail. Hyoga also arrives, saying if they die, they`ll do it together. Poseidon strikes all three Saints, destroying the Dragon and Cygnus Cloths in the process. Saori sings again, still alive and struggling to save the Earth. Seiya gets up again, ready to fight. Mu stops Aiolia from trying to leave again, and as they decide how to act, a Cosmo emerges from the House of Sagittarius and heads towards Poseidon`s Sanctuary. Aiolos` spirit sent the Sagittarius Gold Cloth, covering Seiya. Meanwhile, Shun struggles against Sorrento, but can`t stop the Dead End Symphony. Suddenly, Shun burns his Cosmo and unleashes the Nebula Stream, stopping Sorrento`s movements. Shun pleads Sorrento to surrender, saying that he isn`t an evil person, especially since he can play a beautiful melody and possesses a noble spirit. Sorrento is about to play his Dead End Climax, but is defeated by Shun`s Seventh Sense-empowered Nebula Storm.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Meanwhile, at the North Atlantic Mammoth Pillar, Ikki comes back and confronts Kanon, saying that Saga was stronger than his brother. After blocking the Galaxian Explosion, Ikki uses the Phoenix Illusion on Kanon and having him reveal his secret. Thirteen years ago, Kanon tried to convince his brother, Saga, to kill Athena, who was a baby at the time, and to kill the Pope who chose Aiolos as his successor. Saga then locked his brother in the prison at Cape Sounion, where Athena locked her enemies from ancient wars, until his evil heart would be purified. Kanon then assures Saga that his heart is just as evil, and at that moment, the evil inside Saga awakens (which would begin Saga`s reign of terror in the Sanctuary Chapter). Saga leaves his brother, with Kanon swearing to kill his brother and Athena. During his time in the prison, Kanon almost died many times, but a gentle Cosmo saved his life every time. One day, Kanon found Poseidon`s Trident sealed by Athena, in the prison. When he removed the seal, Kanon was dragged to Poseidon`s Sanctuary. When he entered the temple, he accidentally freed Poseidon`s soul and using the name Sea Dragon, informed him of Athena reincarnating on Earth. Poseidon told Kanon that whenever he revives, he takes over the body of a member of the Solo family. In this case, the member in the Solo family is three-year-old Julian. Since Athena can`t do anything as a baby, Poseidon slept in Julian`s body and told Kanon to wake him up in thirteen years, when the Mariners have gathered. As Poseidon left, Kanon wore the Sea Dragon Scales, swearing to manipulate Julian and the Mariner Generals, rule both the Earth and the sea, also to keep Poseidon asleep forever. Now that Ikki knows the truth, Kanon prepares to finish him off. Meanwhile, at Poseidon`s temple, Seiya gets up again and prepares to fire a golden arrow at the God of the Sea.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Seiya fires again, and Poseidon controls the arrow, but Shaina protects Seiya, and the arrow hits her back. She tells Seiya he is their last hope and that he must not die. At the Sanctuary, a beam of light shoots from the House of Aquarius, heading for Poseidon`s temple. Shaina extracts the arrow from her back and hands it to Seiya, saying she will protect him, no matter what, and to fire as many times as necessary. Poseidon controls the arrow again, but Seiya shields Shaina instead. Shiryu instead takes the hit, protecting them both. Hyoga gets up, and both him and Shiryu decide to be Seiya`s shields. Shun arrives as well, telling him to keep firing. Only this time, Shiryu and the others will deposit their Cosmo in the arrow. Seiya fires the arrow one last time, hoping it doesn`t return this time. Unable to control the arrow, Poseidon is struck by it, knocking his crown off his head, and not only does he start bleeding, but his powerful Cosmo disappears. Seiya and his friends run past him, heading for the Main Breadwinner. Unfortunately, Poseidon fully awakens, unleashing a powerful Cosmos. Back at the North Atlantic Mammoth Pillar, Ikki and Kanon sense Poseidon waking up. Sorrento and Kiki arrive, handing Ikki the Golden Libra Shield, much to Kanon`s surprise. Sorrento, knowing Kanon started the battle, lets Ikki destroy the final pillar. Meanwhile, Poseidon fully awakens from his slumber before he attacks Seiya and his friends. Hyoga gets up to protect Seiya, and then, Camus` spirit sends Hyoga the Aquarius Gold Cloth to cover him. He then uses Aurora Execution to try to stop Poseidon`s attack. Just as the attack is about to fail, Shiryu blocks it with the Libra Shield and wears the Libra Cloth. Now, Seiya, Hyoga and Shiryu, clad in Gold Cloths, are ready for a final showdown with Poseidon.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",

Shiryu tries to destroy the Main Breadwinner with the Golden Shield, but it flies back to him, with the pillar unscathed. Meanwhile, Ikki is mercilessly attacked by Kanon, angry that his ambitions are crushed. Sorrento tries to kill Kanon with his melody, but Ikki asks to talk to Kanon, about the one thing used to seal Poseidon`s soul: Athena`s urn. Seiya and his friends are unable to destroy the pillar with Libra`s weapons. Seiya asks his friends to launch his body with their techniques in order to destroy the pillar that way. Shun gets up, preparing to fight. Ikki reveals to Kanon that the Cosmo that saved his life many times in Cape Sounion, belonged to Athena. Finding it hard to believe, since Athena was a baby at the time, Kanon reveals the location of Athena`s urn, inside the Main Breadwinner. Ikki leaves for the temple, saying Kanon is not worth fighting. Sorrento, sensing Athena`s compassion for humanity, takes his leave, also saying Kanon isn`t worth the effort. Poseidon awakens again, but Ikki holds him long enough for Seiya to destroy the pillar and recover Athena`s urn. Shiryu and Hyoga launch their Rising Dragon and Aurora Thunder Attack, sending Seiya flying towards the pillar. Poseidon gets rid of Ikki and attacks him, Shun, Shiryu and Hyoga. The four Saints burn their Cosmos, covering Seiya and he is able to make a miracle occur. The Main Breadwinner falls apart and it is finally destroyed. Seiya emerges from the rubble, with Saori in his arms. The ocean comes down hard on Poseidon`s Sanctuary, starting to flood it. Saori awakens, with her urn, telling Poseidon to surrender. Poseidon throws his trident to her, but Seiya protects her. Poseidon launches multiple attacks at Saori, but her love for her Saints and humanity cause Seiya and his friends to burn their Cosmos, protecting her and surpassing Poseidon`s strength. Then, the God of the Sea`s soul is dragged to the urn and sealed once again. With Poseidon`s Cosmo extinguished, Athena and her Saints have won the battle. Kiki and Shaina reunite with their friends. Saori then teleports them back to the surface. The floods and rains have seized. Tatsumi, Jabu, Ban, Ichi, Nachi, Geki, Hilda, Freya, Aiolia, Milo, Shaka, Aldebaran, Mu, Marin, Shunrei, and Roshi look up at the sun filled sky, happy that the world is saved. Julian lies unconscious on the surface with Thetis, now a mermaid, swimming away. Seiya, Shiryu, Hyoga, Shun, Ikki, Kiki and Shaina are gathered with Saori. She swears that when evil threatens the Earth and no matter what difficulties they face, she and her Saints will continue to protect and love the world they live in.\nSource: Wikipedia.org",
