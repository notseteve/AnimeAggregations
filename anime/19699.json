  "description" : "Maria, the daughter of a duke, grew up believing she would one day inherit her father`s dukedom. Accordingly, she focused her attentions on honing her martial arts prowess, while thoughts of marriage fell by the wayside. But the arrival of a baby brother in her family means she`s losing her role as heir! Now that she`s decided it`s time to marry after all, she`s arrived a little late to the game! Are there even any eligible bachelors left?\nUpon going to study abroad in a neighboring country where she might still stand a chance at getting hitched, she`s bewildered when the crown prince there declares before all that his engagement to her is null and void! Wait...what engagement?!\nApparently, he`s mistaken her for the wrong girl! But once that`s all cleared up and he catches sight of her knocking out a whole pack of bandits, it turns out that this prince may have a thing for ass-kicking young ladies after all...\nSource: Square Enix",
