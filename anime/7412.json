Unfortunately he is just an orphan working part time to support his grandma and himself.

But the only robot toy he can get his hands on is a broken one that was abandoned by a rich school bully. Feeling pity for the trashed action figure, Joey takes the toy home to repair it. Little did he know, that once he repairs the toy, it will make his hero dream become reality.",
