  "description" : "Sonaeru is set during the 1970s to 1980s, and focuses on the story of Wamura Kotoku, the mayor of the village Fudai at the time, as he attempts to persuade the village assembly that his proposed floodgate and seawall project is not useless. He remembers the 1896 and 1933 Sanriku earthquakes and tsunamis in proposing the project. The 15.5-meter (51-foot) floodgate - the highest in the Tohoku region - ends up sparing Fudai the damage that the 2011 tsunami subjected other coastal towns.\nManabu centers on elementary school children in Kamaishi City during the 2011 disaster, illustrating their lessons learned in disaster readiness to head to higher ground. The story will show Tsunami Tendenko, a local custom telling people to individually seek higher ground on their own initiative, in a lesson that the children would teach their parents.\nSource: ANN",
