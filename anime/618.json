Their lives and fates are guided by strange jewels that contain the spirits and destinies of warriors from the Sangokushi period.\nOne girl, http://anidb.net/ch2075 [Sonsaku Hakufu], has recently moved to Japan and is apparently destined to unite the schools much like her historical counterpart united seven countries long ago. But, like all heroes, there is a darker side to her fate, and as always there is a constant struggle by those around her to break the chains of their own destinies and determine their own lives.",

This order is given to the whole of Nanyou Academy, and results in Hakufu doing battle with Kannei and Ryomou, while Koukin fights all of the students and Saji. Will they all survive?
