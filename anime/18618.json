  "description" : "A group of young girls who all attend a \"girls-only musical school\", recount the formidable years they shared, at times shifting between different characters` viewpoints and time. Awajima Musical School Training Camp, dubbed the \"boarding house\", is where young girls gather from all over Japan to perform on stage: Tabata Wakana aspires to be a musical star; housemaster Takehara Kinue attends to carry on her best friend`s wishes; beautiful Okabe Emi is a scholarship student always at the center of attention; and Ibuki Katsurako who became a teacher at the school though originally from a family of actresses. The unique environment of the musical school is simultaneously a respite space for these aspiring girls and also a harsh battleground that pits young students against each other. It is a place where perseverance can lead to blossoming talents, but also to a cruel reality at times.\nSource: Japan Media Arts Festival",
