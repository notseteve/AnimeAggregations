  "description" : "http://anidb.net/ch152387 [Ichijouin Lili] is a Japanese exchange student who travels to England to enroll in the prestigious Saint Thomas Art Academy. Determined to become a painter, she arrives under pressure: her parents expect her to rise to the top of her class within six months or return home.\nLili`s drive intensifies when she encounters http://anidb.net/ch152379 [Kit Church], a gifted aristocratic student known for his talent and detachment. While Kit has devoted himself entirely to painting, Lili`s sincerity and resilience begin to shift something in him. The two share little beyond their love for art, yet their relationship quickly becomes central to life at the academy.\nSource: Netflix",
