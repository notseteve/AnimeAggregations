Nina confronts him about Golneo`s revelations and he says he did what he did in order to survive. The orphanage where he lived needed money badly and the only way he could obtain enough was to participate in such illegal fights. Nina cannot accept this line of thinking.\nThe exploration of the derelict city turns up more mysteries. There are no human remains anywhere: some might be expected if the city were completely overrun by contaminoids, suggesting that the population might have escaped. The members of the 5th Unit begin to behave strangely, Shante even attacks Golneo out of the blue but is subdued.\nMeanwhile, in Glendan, Lee-lin and her father are attacked by a monster, which turns out to be the mutated form of Gahard Barehn, who has been mutated by exposure to contaminoids. He is seeking out everyone who was connected to Layfon and that final battle where he had been injured, which naturally includes Lee-lin. Savaris manages to kill him afterwards.",

Layfon advises caution but is overruled by Nina, and they proceed deeper. Layfon tells Felli a bit more of the circumstances surrounding his disgrace and subsequent expulsion from the Heaven`s Blades and Glendan. They find a large number of graves, which deepens the mystery further. Layfon encounters a mysterious creature that was the city`s electronic spirit.\nLater, Layfon is attacked by Shante despite Golneo`s explicit instructions to leave him alone, despite his anger against him. He has no trouble fending off her attacks. Golneo arrives and attempts to stop her, but their fighting has damaged a fuel container which explodes, but Layfon manages to use his kei to prevent them from being more seriously injured.",

She is initially sceptical of the reasons why she should learn, until she sees Machen being pushed by Naruki and Miffy into being taught how to swim by Layfon.\nThe next day Layfon is asked to teach Felli how to swim. The fact that she seems to be getting so close to him bothers the president so much that he calls Layfon privately and confronts him, warning him that if he does anything to hurt Felli he will crush him, which frightens and perplexes Layfon.\nMeanwhile, a group of terrorists has invaded the spa and have taken the girls hostage at the dressing room.

A group of outsiders posing as students has been caught peddling the illegal drug known as Overload, which accelerates the user`s kei flow, but it is prohibited because of its dangerous side effects. The pedlars are trapped in a building, and they make their move, making an explosion they hope to distract the police from their escape, but Layfon sees through the ruse and is attacked by a swordsman. Nina is startled by the explosion and runs to the scene, where she is herself attacked by a woman wielding a bow, who prevents her from getting closer. Sharnid, while following after his former friend in the 10th Platoon, Dalchena, stumbles onto the scene himself, where she confronts him.\nThe swordsman Layfon encounters introduces himself as Haia Salinban Lyia, a member of the Salinban Mercenary group. He says that he isn`t one of the drug traffickers but only accompanied them because that was the only way he could reach Zuellni. Haia proves exceptionally skilled, managing to break Layfon`s dite, and escapes.",
