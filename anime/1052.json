  "description" : "* Based on the manga by the same name by http://anidb.net/cr23354 [Moriyama Daisuke].\nThe 1920s were well known as a period of excitement and change. It was a time where the women were fast and loose, and the booze flowed freely, in spite of prohibition laws. But the elite of society has found a new form of excess: conjuring devils. By 1928, things were getting out of hand.\nA special organization called the http://anidb.net/ch2570 [Order of Magdalene] was created centuries ago to deal with this kind of threat. Headed by http://anidb.net/ch2568 [Father Remington] and http://anidb.net/ch2567 [Sister Kate], these young men and women were equipped with heavy duty weapons to perform God`s good will.\nOne of the more infamous members of this group is http://anidb.net/ch2563 [Sister Rosette]. Her fame is not necessarily positive. In fact, Sister Kate thinks she is nothing more than a menace to society, because whenever Rosette is on a case, things tend to explode. It also does not help that Rosette`s partner is one of the very things they fight against, a very powerful devil named http://anidb.net/ch2564 [Chrono]. Bound to Rosette by a mystical amulet, Chrono may be under control, but that does not make him any less dangerous.\nWhile Rosette and Chrono fight for the Magdalene Order, something is stirring in the background. An evil, more powerful than Chrono, is waiting in the shadows, ready to destroy not only the Order, but all of creation!",

When the two hunt down a menacing demon in an abandoned restaurant, the building is consequently destroyed.

Rosette and Chrono are sent to destroy a gigantic devil on a cruise ship.

After having shot off the horn of the demon, Rosette promptly loses her gun containing the Spirit from her hand, as to when the demon approached and startled her. A suspicious man, the one responsible for obtaining the weapon, breaks into the convent, revealing himself as the same demon from before. The demon transforms recklessly by absorbing the aura of the Spirit. However, Chrono begins to transform after seeing Rosette tossed aside into the ground. Rosette later manages to calm Chrono down and is able to blast the demon. Elsewhere, Joshua Christopher slaughters a viscount under Aion, as Fiore Harvenheit, Joshua`s caretaker, witnesses the result of his massacre. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Rosette reluctantly bumps into Azmaria in an equipment room, but she is caught by Lerajie, Ricardo`s servant. As the two catch up with Chrono, the three escape outside but are attacked by the demon army under Lerajie`s command. Several hotel guests suffered from injuries after Rosette and Chrono defeated the army. However, Azamaria responsively vocalizes, having the angelic powers to heal the wounded. Back at the convent, Sister Kate and Father Remington inform Rosette that Joshua, being her younger brother, is an apostle of hope, though harnessing demonic powers. Rosette later takes Chrono and Azmaria to a nearby lake, in hope of cheering up the latter. After sunset, Lerajie, revealed to be a viscount under Aion, ambushes the area and captures Azmaria. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria take a trip to the Seventh Bell Orphanage, where Rosette and Joshua had previously resided. The orphanage was destroyed yet frozen in time. Four years ago, a short-tempered Rosette had cared for a sickly Joshua. She tries to convince him not to join the Magdalene Order. The two later slip into a riverbed, where they end up falling into a pit. Joshua uses his powers to heal Rosette of her bloodily wounded knee, but Joshua wonders why his powers cannot heal himself. They find the tomb of Mary Magdalene underground, encountering Chrono for the first time, who introduces himself as a devil. The three go out on a picnic, and Chrono talks about how the astral lines are the souls that encompass the universe, which catches the attention of Joshua. The three later spend the rest of the day together. Come nightfall, Joshua goes to see Father Remington, in hopes of finding a cure for his illness. Meanwhile, Rosette and Chrono are distraught when Aion shows up in the form of an eagle. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Aion unveils to Rosette that he removed Chrono`s horns and has given them to Joshua, acquire him enhanced supernatural abilities. The side effect, however, is that the horns give him the power to hear the thoughts of others. Joshua attacks a frightened orphan in anguish, turning him into stone. Rosette is taken to the orphanage by Chrono, only to see many other orphans turned into stone. She sees Joshua, who warns her to get away from him because of the painful noises of thoughts in his head. A whirlwind erects and destroys the orphanage, but time freezes and the orphange stood still. Chrono takes Rosette away from the whirlwind, but he mentions that his astral energy is depleting due to the loss of his horns. The only other option is for the devil to make a contract with a human, in which the former`s power is augmented while the latter`s life is diminished. Rosette is willing to sacrifice her life to help save Joshua. Chrono accepts her request, and thus the two are bound by a pact. In present time, Rosette, Chrono, and Azmaria head back to the convent after reminiscing in the past. Elsewhere, Aion visits Joshua and informs him that a third apostle is found. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Satella shows up to fend it off, much to Rosette`s chagrin. Sister Kate and Father Remington informs the militia that the hellhound was summoned by a woman who used black magic in order to seek vengeance against the mafia who killed her fiancé. It is also noted that the hellhound becomes more corporeal after each mafia clan is devoured. It is seen that Satella is hired by a mafia clan as a bodyguard. Elder Hamilton, who introduces his new motorcycle creation deemed the \"Gabriel Hound\", tells Rosette and Chrono that the same mafia clan is being attack by the hellhound in a subway tunnel. When they arrive, they save Satella from the hellhound. It is shown that while Rosette is selfless in manner, Satella seems selfish in attitude when they talk about sacrificing the life of one for another. The two girls ride on the Gabriel Hound and catch up to the hellhound. Rosette uses a Gospel to obliterate the hellhound. \nSource: Wikipedia",

They encounter a mother and child, both of which Chrono senses as suspicious. Satella, who is also aboard the train, invites the three into her private railroad car. However, Rosette is lured by Rizelle into the dining car, soon finding out that Joshua is crying out for her. Rizelle splits the two passenger car, separating Rosette from the rest. Chrono manages to break through the dining car, but Rizelle has stolen Rosette`s soul timepiece and has held Azmaria and Satella captive. Rosette is forced to shoot Chrono in the heart in order to gain back the soul timepiece, while Azmaria releases the victims from Rizelle`s control. This does not stop Rizelle, nonetheless, as she pulls Rosette on top of the railroad car. Rosette is overwhelmed by Rizelle`s attacks, but Rosette shuns Rizelle for her relationship with Aion. Even firing a Gospel does not stop Rizelle, but it is when Rosette stabs her with her own horn that she falls off the train into the abyss as she disintegrates. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Fiore protects Joshua from an enraged Genai, who is distraught that Joshua was at fault for Rizelle`s death. Duffau calls Rosette the reincarnation of Mary of Magdalene, having the power of an apostle, noting that she will have marks engraved in her body.

      "description" : "Joshua battles Chrono aggressively in the sky, causing mass destruction within the city. Genai is stopped by Duffau when he attacks Father Remington. Seeing Rosette in Aion`s clutches, Chrono flies down to save her, but he is blindsided by Joshua`s attacked. In response, Chrono grabs hold of Joshua`s horn, making him yell in agony. However, Chrono turns into stone when he rips off the horns from Joshua`s head. Duffau destroys Genai, and Father Remington eradicates Shader. Aion escapes with Rosette in his possession. Back at the convent, Duffau explains that the ritual of atonement can be meant to purify or taint the soul of a human being, whether performed by an angel or a devil. Father Remington and Reverend Gilliam believes that Aion is planning to use the deterrence of Rosette as a weapon. Elsewhere, Aion shows Rosette the end result of what Chrono and Joshua did to the city, all in love for her sake. Aion asks her to join his side in order to save the inhabitants of the San Francisco. Rosette agrees to his proposition, but she still wears the soul timepiece as a reminder for her life. \nSource: Wikipedia",

      "description" : "Satella is upset that Fiore sees Joshua as her younger brother, and Azmaria is confused as to why she survived after the ritual of atonement. In the past, Mary Magdalene dreams of Chrono as a frightening devil in distress. Moments after Chrono arrives to see her, Father Remington has come to slay the devil. Chrono luckily escapes with Mary Magdalene and finds out that she can predict the future. The two find Aion, who has ripped off his horns. Aion is taken to see the other sinners, constructing the soul timepiece and preparing ritual of atonement. Mary Magdalene unveils to Chrono her stigmata, carrying the memories of all souls except her own. She also states that her own death will be in the hands of Chrono. She warns him that Aion will soon betray him. Instead of performing the ritual of atonement on a peak, Aion orders Chrono to end Mary Magdalene`s life, but he hesitates. Aion strikes Chrono with a single blow, badly wounding him. However, Mary Magdalene takes Chrono to the meadow below, where she issues a contract with him using the soul timepiece in order to save his life in place of hers. In the present, Chrono remembers what led to the tomb of Mary Magdalene. He unfreezes from stone, and he later learns that Joshua is amnesiac. Meanwhile, Aion is surrounded by Duffau and the pursuers, but they were no match against him. Gurio, informing Chrono that Rosette is responsible for Duffau`s death, disappears right in front of him. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Elder Hamilton gives Chrono a sword with Enochian texts engraved into the blade, allowing Chrono to battle against Aion without having to transform. Fiore breaks out of the convent, taking Joshua with her. Rosette is to use her power of miracles to heal the sick and wounded under the command of Aion. Rosette soon gathers a large crowd of people who refer to her as a savior. Satella spots Fiore with Joshua, and she forges a jewelsummoning barrier. Failing to convince her to be her sister, Satella is forced to spar against Fiore. After Chrono touches Rosette`s bloodstained wrist, Aion exposes Chrono as a devil in front of the crowd. Fiore reveals that she is the shadow of Satella`s sister who died ten years ago by Aion`s heads. Satella embraces Fiore and then stabs both of them using her jewel, causing Fiore to remember Satella before she passes away. Satella is found heavily bruised, as she tells Chrono to find Rosette and asks Azmaria to sing before her life ends. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Aion also provokes Chrono by mentioning that he is destined to take Rosette`s life. Chrono ends up letting Aion getting away with Rosette. Father Remington and Elder Hamilton says that the crowd is condemning the Magdalene Order. Showing Azmaria his horns next to Satella`s coffin, Chrono blames himself for having killed the few that were dear to him, all in previously siding with Aion for obtaining freedom from sin. A photographer delivers a picture to Azmaria that was taken with her friends during the carnival. He also gives a picture of Rosette exposing her wrists to Sister Kate, who shows it to Father Remington and Elder Hamilton. Sister Kate later tells the Council of the Catholic Church that many people are carving cross-shaped marks in their wrists to crusade in hopes for freedom. Azmaria shows Chrono the picture taken at the carnival, as he realizes that he must not run away from his problems. Chrono is led to Central Park, where Aion hands Rosette her gun to end Chrono`s life. Chrono throws his horns at Aion in order to turn him to stone and release control of Rosette. This does not stop him, however, as he throws his own horns back at Chrono, severely weakening him. Rosette releases the seal of the soul timepiece, transforming and healing Chrono. He is finally able to defeat Aion, but he is injured in the process. \nSource: Wikipedia",

Sister Kate tells the owner of the orphanage that Rosette and Chrono are nowhere to be found, and Azmaria sings for the orphans. Father Remington and Elder Hamilton travel underground to the tomb of Mary Magdalene, seeing Aion`s horns here. It is understood that Aion`s horns move time while Chrono`s horns freeze time. Nobody seems to know the whereabouts of Rosette and Chrono. Joshua tells Father Remington that he is currently writing a novel about a girl, her younger brother, and her extraterrestrial partner who travel on the astral lines to defeat the devils. Rosette and Chrono are seen sitting outside on a porch watching the sunset, as they spend their day on earth. Azmaria hears word of their location, and she cries when she sees them smiling and holding hands in death. Sister Kate talks with Father Remington over the phone about how Rosette shows goodness and mercy even being bound by contract with a devil. They both are concerned about the prophecy of war that is soon being fulfilled. Azmaria prays for Rosette at her tombstone. Years later on May 13, 1981, Father Remington is shock after shortly seeing Aion in the Vatican shortly before the shooting of Pope John Paul II. \nSource: Wikipedia",
