  "description" : "On an April night in Tokyo, still too early for fireworks, university student Kakero Mano meets a woman named Koharu Fuyutsuki. She is a beautiful girl who stands out from the crowd, laughs a lot, and exudes a warmth that contrasts sharply with Kakero`s own introversion. But there was something Kakero didn`t know at first—she can`t see. Unlike Kakero, Koharu hasn`t given up on anything, even with her blindness. She attends university daily, shows interest in clubs, makes friends—and dreams of launching fireworks one day. Kakero wonders why, when she can`t see them...but maybe it doesn`t matter. And maybe he can start moving forward, too, for the girl who`s always been by his side.\nSource: Yen Press",
