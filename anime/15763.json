  "description" : "The film tells the story of Yugong Yishan in the Neolithic era, 10,000 years ago, through the eyes of a young boy.\nThe arrogant mountain gods have piled up two huge mountains, Wangwu and Taihang, on Yugong`s doorstep, and he is determined to dig them up. In the face of many doubts and enormous difficulties, Yugong did not back down and took his son and the villagers with him in the struggle. During the struggle, Yugong`s son, Qingfeng, and the mountain spirit, Ember, come into contact with each other and understand each other, finding an alternative solution: to remove the mountain.\nIn the end, not only were they astonished by Yugong`s bravery and perseverance, but they were also moved by the mutual understanding and sacrifice of Yugong`s son and the mountain spirits, and Yugong and the mountain gods were able to remove their preconceptions and prejudices. With courage, perseverance and wisdom, mankind has achieved a harmonious coexistence with nature.\nsource: douban/DeepL",
