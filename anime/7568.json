  "description" : "* Based on a manga series written and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr18553 [Wakaki Tamiki], serialised in http://anidb.net/cr23232 [Weekly Shounen Sunday].\nhttp://anidb.net/ch18463 [Katsuragi Keima], a second-year high school student, is an avid dating sim gamer. He is known on the Internet as The Capturing God for his legendary skills to be able to capture any 2D girl in games. However, in his actual school life, Keima is known as otamegane.\nKeima receives an e-mail offering him a contract to capture girls. He accepts what is thought to be a challenge, and a demon from Hell nicknamed http://anidb.net/ch18462 [Elsee] appears. She asks for his cooperation to help her in catching the runaway spirits. These spirits hide themselves inside the girls` heart, and Elsee suggests that the only method to force the spirits out is by capturing their hearts — making them fall in love. Appalled by the idea, Keima refuses after clarifying to Elsee that he is only interested in capturing 2D girls and that he detests reality. Nevertheless, with the contract already accepted, Keima will have to help Elsee no matter what; if they fail, both Elsee and Keima will lose their heads.\nNote: The first episode was shown during an event at Akihabara UDX theatre on Saturday, September 25, limited to 100 participants chosen through a postcard lottery. The television broadcast started on October 07, 2010. Otamegane is a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku and megane (glasses).",
