  "description" : "Nothing worries Oka Satomi more than the upcoming final choir competition of his middle school career -- right up until he is accosted by a stranger from the shadows who demands, \"Let`s go karaoke!\" As a yakuza, Narita Kyouji doesn`t scare easily, but a terrifying prospect has driven him to seek Satomi`s help. The boss is holding a karaoke contest, with the loser forced to get a tattoo to be selected and torturously applied by the boss himself! Oka has been to many vocal rehearsals over the years, but never one-on-one karaoke sessions with a gangster!!\nSource: Yen Press",
