  "description" : "The term \"KiyaKiya\" comes from the old Japanese expression \"mune ga kiyakiya suru.\" I first encountered it in Shibusawa Tatsuhiko`s book Introductory Essays on Girls, in the chapter about \"childhood experiences.\" The expression, which describes \"an enigmatic, nostalgic, disturbing feeling,\" or an impression of \"deja-vu\", is at the origin of my \"KiyaKiya\" series.\nIn our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of \"KiyaKiya\" and the related painting and drawing series.\nSource: Official website",
