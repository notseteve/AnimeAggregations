He meets the members of the rather small section, and they explain to him exactly what they actually do: the most advanced androids produced by SA, the Giftias, have the most amount of emotion and human-like qualities of them all, however, due to technological limitations they have a limited service life, and it is the job of Terminal Services to retrieve Giftias that are about to reach their end of service. They work in teams with one Giftia and one human as an observer, to ease the human owners of Giftias into the process of letting go of their androids.\nTsukasa is paired with a Giftia named Isla, an experienced veteran of the job, and they watch the process of retrieval done by the Giftia Zack and his partner Kinushima Michiru. One such retrieval goes smoothly, the owners having accepted the passing of their beloved android, while the second one is much more difficult, the old lady owner slamming her door in the faces of Terminal Services personnel for the third time.\nTsukasa and Isla over the next several days attempt to reach the old lady, as her android`s service life will end in only a few more days. Isla tries to climb over the wall and in so doing is seen by the android, that is in the form of a little girl, and she convinces her owner to let them in. Thus they manage to reach the old lady and convince her to accept the retrieval of her Giftia.",

He learns that she has not been working in the field like that for some years and thinks that she just needs to get back into her groove. He watches her undergoing training. As such, he attempts to do some of the work of negotiating with the owners of Giftias himself, and sets out writing a manual describing the process.

He notices that she is still wearing the company uniform and so he buys her some casual clothes, and he remembers that he had seen her in the mall the day he first came to work, and asks her why. She tells him she was there to buy herbs at an herb shop at the roof of the mall, and he says that that might be a suitable gift for his friend. To help her choose appropriate herbs she asks him to describe this friend, and her description makes her think this friend is an annoying person.\nTsukasa sees an amusement park nearby from the roof of the building and invites Isla to go there, and he tells her that the gifts he had bought were really for her, and that he wants to be friends apart from their work relationship and to make happy memories with her. This last part troubles her and she leaves him behind. When he later comes home he sees Isla outside their unit, and she apologises for leaving him like that, and he gives her a small key fob he bought at the amusement park.",

The gangster tells his giftia to enjoy the time she has left, but Isla says that in exchange he ought to join them as well, because nothing makes one happier than being with the one you love.
