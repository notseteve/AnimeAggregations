  "description" : "Xuan Qi, a mediocre talent, was originally a mere psychic, unranked on the Avatar Rankings. His life`s aspiration was simply to survive in this small world, prioritizing safety. However, while out and about, he happened upon a fierce battle between the Alluring Empress and an ancient demon, becoming an unforeseen casualty. In this critical moment, Xuan Qi unexpectedly activated the \"Tianxiu\" system, gaining the ability to continuously gain admiration by displaying the demeanor of a peerless master. From then on, Xuan Qi, by accident, was forced to assume the identity of the \"reincarnation of the Divine Emperor.\" With seemingly effortless skill, he slew ancient demons and continuously defeated masters of the Otherworldly Demonic Path, instantly becoming renowned and revered throughout the Great Victory Divine Land. Even more remarkable, his every word and action was often misinterpreted as having deeper meaning. Countless psychics revered him as a deity, while the Otherworldly Demonic Path regarded him as a formidable threat.\nsource: bgm.tv/googletranslate",
