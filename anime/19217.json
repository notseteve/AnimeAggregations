  "description" : "* Based on a fantasy isekai adventure light novel series written by http://anidb.net/cr78265 [Nekoko] and illustrated by http://anidb.net/cr73535 [Naji Yanagida].\nOur hero wakes up one day in a brand new world...but his new life doesn`t come with fighting skills or magic powers, or even arms and legs! He`s reborn as a helpless egg, stuck in an unfamiliar forest surrounded by terrifying, hungry beasts. But eggs hatch, hatchlings grow up, and humble beginnings can lead to something great. He`ll do his best to become the strongest dragon ever, and no measly shell will get in his way!\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
