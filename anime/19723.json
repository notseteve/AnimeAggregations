  "description" : "A monster that people call GAEA-TIMA devastates a small, seaside town. Ten years later, the resilient community has emerged as a tourist destination, and Miyako, who became a local celebrity by surviving the attack, is making a living selling mini-replicas of the beast. But when GAEA-TIMA returns, Miyako and her neighbors will discover that their enduring connection to the creature goes deeper than tourism and trauma. Just what is the true agenda behind the attack of the \"gigantis?\" Are there more like GAEA-TIMA waiting for their moment? And is humanity capable of responding to violence with anything other than more violence?\nSource: Kodansha",
