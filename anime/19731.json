  "description" : "Dweeby high schooler Uehara Yuuki has created the perfect romantic comedy heroine—she`s bashful, airheaded, and completely chaste. When an editor at Uehara`s dream publisher coldly dismisses his manga story as trite and lacking realism, it sends Uehara into a spiral of despair that pushes him into the path of his bubbly, gorgeous classmate, Miyamoto Niina—an aspiring manga artist herself!\nHaving gotten the similar feedback on her own manga, Miyamoto proposes she and Uehara engage in a fake relationship, since neither of them has any romantic experience. But Miyamoto is far from the perfect heroine Uehara`s concocted, and he certainly isn`t the cocky hero from her story either. Can their wacky relationship turn their manga dreams into reality, or will it lead to even more comic disasters?\nSource: Seven Seas Entertainment",
