  "description" : "Six months ago, a terrible motorcycle accident derailed college student http://anidb.net/ch106861 [Natsusa]`s promising rugby career. Newly out of the hospital and restarting his first year of college, Natsusa can`t quite bring himself to give up the sport, even though he`s been told that his body simply can`t handle it anymore – and his best friend since childhood http://anidb.net/ch106866 [Sei] is there to adamantly enforce the doctor`s words. So Natsusa decides to participate in the only way he still can: as a manager. It`s not the same as playing, but it does put him in a position to continue to be involved, even as repercussions from the accident in the form of another missing player and current player attitudes make it clear that this, too, is going to be an uphill battle.\nSource: ANN",
