  "description" : "The Prince of Tang, the Holy Son of the East, was born at the wrong time, and his country was ruined and his family was ruined. With his wet nurse living in a border town, the wet nurse has been quietly raising the prince, and hopes that he can take on the responsibility of restoring the country in the future. She also gave him a name that has the feelings of family and country. His name: Xi Zi Tang. In the blink of an eye, Xi Zitang turned eight years old and was sent to Chuiyun Mountain by his wet nurse to practice. After practicing for ten years, he finally picked up the Martial God`s Hammer left by his ancestors and broke through the martial arts realm and stepped into the fairyland. With the energy of a newborn calf who is not afraid of tigers, he came out of the mountain and vowed to defeat the Eight Immortals, level Penglai and liberate the Four Kingdoms. The continent returns peace to the world. Immortal cultivators are everywhere in the Four Continents. Xi Zitang is just a younger brother. After being identified by the town’s Immortal List, he received the certificate of a lower-level mortal immortal. However, in the Tang Dynasty today, even those who are required to deliver food are required to be mortal immortals. Sir, what should I do? After ten years of saving BUFF, how will Xi Zitang, who is new to the world, start a bloody storm in the world?\nsource: bgm.tv/googletranslate",
