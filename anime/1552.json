However, when his cover is blown, his battalion abandons him and he ends up in the home of the Hinata family. There, he`s forced to do household chores and sleep in a dark basement that was once a prison cell haunted by the ghost of an innocent girl.\nKeroro and his other 4 squad members continue with their plans to conquer Pekopon, aside from building Gundam Models and being lazy in various other ways...\nRephrased from ANN\nNote: Starting from episode 308, TV Tokyo shortened the morning broadcast at 10:00 to 10 minutes (plus advertisement).
