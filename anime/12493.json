  "description" : "Delete Beach is a futuristic tale set in the near future about a schoolgirl who joins an anti-capitalist resistance group. In a society in which carbon-based energy is outlawed but which continues to toil under the regime of expansion and growth, petroleum is the fighters` refuge. They smoke it, squander it and hand over their bodies to the sea, to eventually provide fuel for future struggles.\nInspired by idyllic Scandinavian landscapes and the eco-feminist themes which propose anime as a political genre, director Phil Collins` collaboration with one of Japan`s leading animation studios http://anidb.net/cr738 [STUDIO 4C] and award winning composer http://anidb.net/cr47710 [Mica Levi] brings to life a world at once familiar and disquietingly corroded, left unmoored of any certainty in an age after the end of oil.\nSource: Official website\nNote: the movie was first screened at Bergen Assembly 2016 in Norway on September 1st.",
